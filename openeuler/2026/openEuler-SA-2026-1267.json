Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected is the function Assimp::MD3Importer::ValidateSurfaceHeaderOffsets of the file code/AssetLib/MD3/MD3Loader.cpp of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.(CVE-2025-3549)\n\nA vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function MDCImporter::ValidateSurfaceHeader of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDC/MDCLoader.cpp. The manipulation of the argument pcSurface2 leads to out-of-bounds read. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.(CVE-2025-5165)\n\nA vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3.
