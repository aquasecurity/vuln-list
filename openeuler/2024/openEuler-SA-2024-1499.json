      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix out of bounds in init_smb2_rsp_hdr()\n\nIf client send smb2 negotiate request and then send smb1 negotiate\nrequest, init_smb2_rsp_hdr is called for smb1 negotiate request since\nneed_neg is set to false. This patch ignore smb1 packets after -\u003eneed_neg\nis set to false.(CVE-2023-52441)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling\n\nIf we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl()\nwe proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top.\nBut we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL, and so if we then\nget another error during the retry, before the fb lookup, we proceed\nthe unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference.\nThe end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed\nwhile it's still in use.\n\nReset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again\nuntil we've done another fb lookup.\n\nThis turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async\nflips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I\nsaw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking\nthe framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops\ninstead, and from there it was easier to track down the culprit.(CVE-2023-52486)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_probe, \u0026jpeg-\u003ejob_timeout_work is bound with\nmtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in\nmtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while\nmark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.\n\nThere are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove the\nmodule, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup.\nThe possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a\nuse-after-free bug.\n\nCPU0                  CPU1\nmtk_jpeg_dec_...    |\n  start worker\t    |\n                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work\nmtk_jpeg_remove     |\n  v4l2_m2m_release  |\n    kfree(m2m_dev); |\n                    |\n                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv\n                    |   m2m_dev-\u003ecurr_ctx //use\n\nIf we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release,\nit will have a similar sequence.\n\nFix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker\nsuccessfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in\neither mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.(CVE-2023-52491)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function\n\n__dma_async_device_channel_register() can fail. In case of failure,\nchan-\u003elocal is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan-\u003elocal is nullified.\nWhen dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API or\nintentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionally\nunregistered, leading to this NULL pointer:\n[    1.318693] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0\n[...]\n[    1.484499] Call trace:\n[    1.486930]  device_del+0x40/0x394\n[    1.490314]  device_unregister+0x20/0x7c\n[    1.494220]  __dma_async_device_channel_unregister+0x68/0xc0\n\nLook at dma_async_device_register() function error path, channel device\nunregistration is done only if chan-\u003elocal is not NULL.\n\nThen add the same condition at the beginning of\n__dma_async_device_channel_unregister() function, to avoid NULL pointer\nissue whatever the API used to reach this function.(CVE-2023-52492)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: Drop chan lock before queuing buffers\n\nEnsure read and write locks for the channel are not taken in succession by\ndropping the read lock from parse_xfer_event() such that a callback given\nto client can potentially queue buffers and acquire the write lock in that\nprocess. Any queueing of buffers should be done without channel read lock\nacquired as it can result in multiple locks and a soft lockup.\n\n[mani: added fixes tag and cc'ed stable](CVE-2023-52493)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer\n\nThough we do check the event ring read pointer by \"is_valid_ring_ptr\"\nto make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the\npointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements\nare 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer\ncould lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.\n\nSo add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.(CVE-2023-52494)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code\n\nIt is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core\ncode deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument\nfunction synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in\nthat case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already\nheld.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within\ndpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may\ncause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a\nrequisite supplier device's one, for example).\n\nAddress this by changing the code in question to use\nasync_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous\nexecution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly\nrun them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.(CVE-2023-52498)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntee: amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_session\n\nThere is a potential race condition in amdtee_close_session that may\ncause use-after-free in amdtee_open_session. For instance, if a session\nhas refcount == 1, and one thread tries to free this session via:\n\n    kref_put(\u0026sess-\u003erefcount, destroy_session);\n\nthe reference count will get decremented, and the next step would be to\ncall destroy_session(). However, if in another thread,\namdtee_open_session() is called before destroy_session() has completed\nexecution, alloc_session() may return 'sess' that will be freed up\nlater in destroy_session() leading to use-after-free in\namdtee_open_session.\n\nTo fix this issue, treat decrement of sess-\u003erefcount and removal of\n'sess' from session list in destroy_session() as a critical section, so\nthat it is executed atomically.(CVE-2023-52503)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()\n\nFei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on\na 5-level paging machine:\n\n\tBUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching()\n\tRead of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0\n\t...\n\t__asan_load4()\n\trcu_is_watching()\n\ttrace_hardirqs_on()\n\ttext_poke_early()\n\tapply_alternatives()\n\t...\n\nOn machines with 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57)\ngets patched. It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on\n__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().\n\nKASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the\nKASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START\nstatic, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.\n\nFix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.\n\n[ mingo: updated the changelog ](CVE-2023-52504)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: nfc: llcp: Add lock when modifying device list\n\nThe device list needs its associated lock held when modifying it, or the\nlist could become corrupted, as syzbot discovered.(CVE-2023-52524)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nteam: fix null-ptr-deref when team device type is changed\n\nGet a null-ptr-deref bug as follows with reproducer [1].\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000228\n...\nRIP: 0010:vlan_dev_hard_header+0x35/0x140 [8021q]\n...\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? __die+0x24/0x70\n ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x150\n ? exc_page_fault+0x69/0x150\n ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n ? vlan_dev_hard_header+0x35/0x140 [8021q]\n ? vlan_dev_hard_header+0x8e/0x140 [8021q]\n neigh_connected_output+0xb2/0x100\n ip6_finish_output2+0x1cb/0x520\n ? nf_hook_slow+0x43/0xc0\n ? ip6_mtu+0x46/0x80\n ip6_finish_output+0x2a/0xb0\n mld_sendpack+0x18f/0x250\n mld_ifc_work+0x39/0x160\n process_one_work+0x1e6/0x3f0\n worker_thread+0x4d/0x2f0\n ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n kthread+0xe5/0x120\n ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n ret_from_fork+0x34/0x50\n ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n\n[1]\n$ teamd -t team0 -d -c '{\"runner\": {\"name\": \"loadbalance\"}}'\n$ ip link add name t-dummy type dummy\n$ ip link add link t-dummy name t-dummy.100 type vlan id 100\n$ ip link add name t-nlmon type nlmon\n$ ip link set t-nlmon master team0\n$ ip link set t-nlmon nomaster\n$ ip link set t-dummy up\n$ ip link set team0 up\n$ ip link set t-dummy.100 down\n$ ip link set t-dummy.100 master team0\n\nWhen enslave a vlan device to team device and team device type is changed\nfrom non-ether to ether, header_ops of team device is changed to\nvlan_header_ops. That is incorrect and will trigger null-ptr-deref\nfor vlan-\u003ereal_dev in vlan_dev_hard_header() because team device is not\na vlan device.\n\nCache eth_header_ops in team_setup(), then assign cached header_ops to\nheader_ops of team net device when its type is changed from non-ether\nto ether to fix the bug.(CVE-2023-52574)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/mm: Fix null-pointer dereference in pgtable_cache_add\n\nkasprintf() returns a pointer to dynamically allocated memory\nwhich can be NULL upon failure. Ensure the allocation was successful\nby checking the pointer validity.(CVE-2023-52607)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: arm_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency\n\nOn reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed\nto retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message sequence\nnumber identifies a transaction which is still pending, the related\npayload is fetched too.\n\nWhen an SCMI command times out the channel ownership remains with the\nplatform until eventually a late reply is received and, as a consequence,\nany further transmission attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel\nto be relinquished by the platform.\n\nOnce that late reply is received the channel ownership is given back\nto the agent and any pending request is then allowed to proceed and\noverwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply; then the wait\nfor the reply to the new request starts.\n\nIt has been observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can\nbe wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that happens\nthe SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the fact that the\nmessage header now present in the SMT area is related to the new pending\ntransaction, even though the real reply has still to arrive.\n\nThis race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by looking at the\nchannel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform will have set the\nchannel free bit before triggering the completion IRQ.\n\nAdd a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P ISR.(CVE-2023-52608)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove\n\nA PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev-\u003ecdev is held open. The call\nto stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past\nswitchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the\ntrailing put_device(), just before return.\n\nAt that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the\nstdev-\u003emmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev-\u003epdev reference was not a counted\none. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause\na fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,\nwould pass a stale \u0026stdev-\u003epdev-\u003edev pointer.\n\nFix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after\nstdev_kill(). Counting the stdev-\u003epdev ref is now optional, but may prevent\nfuture accidents.\n\nReproducible via the script at\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/r/20231113212150.96410-1-dns@arista.com(CVE-2023-52617)\n\nA null pointer dereference vulnerability was found in ath10k_wmi_tlv_op_pull_mgmt_tx_compl_ev() in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/wmi-tlv.c in the Linux kernel. This issue could be exploited to trigger a denial of service.(CVE-2023-7042)\n\nA race condition was found in the Linux kernel's media/xc4000 device driver in xc4000 xc4000_get_frequency() function. This can result in return value overflow issue, possibly leading to malfunction or denial of service issue.\n\n\n\n\n(CVE-2024-24861)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix global oob in ksmbd_nl_policy\n\nSimilar to a reported issue (check the commit b33fb5b801c6 (\"net:\nqualcomm: rmnet: fix global oob in rmnet_policy\"), my local fuzzer finds\nanother global out-of-bounds read for policy ksmbd_nl_policy.

Assumed that the connection has been registered in a\nlink group by smc_conn_create() but the rmb_desc has not yet been\ninitialized by smc_buf_create(), thus causing the illegal access to\nconn-\u003ermb_desc. So fix it by checking before dump.(CVE-2024-26615)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs\n\nThe dreamcastcard-\u003etimer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the\nspu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard-\u003etimer.\n\nWhen the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be\ndeallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker\nthread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly\nregardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and\nthe worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,\nthe UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:\n\n      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)\nsnd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |\n ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker\n                                 |    mod_timer()\n  flush_work()                   |\n  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer\n  kfree(dreamcastcard-\u003echannel)  |    schedule_work()\n                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker\n  ...                            |    dreamcastcard-\u003echannel-\u003e //USE\n\nIn order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,\ncall mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement\nPCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop\nop will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.(CVE-2024-26654)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: fix use-after-free bug\n\nThe bug can be triggered by sending a single amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl\nto the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with an invalid address and size.\nThe bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung \u003cjoonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr\u003e.\nFor example the following code:\n\nstatic void Syzkaller1(int fd)\n{\n\tstruct drm_amdgpu_gem_userptr arg;\n\tint ret;\n\n\targ.addr = 0xffffffffffff0000;\n\targ.size = 0x80000000; /*2 Gb*/\n\targ.flags = 0x7;\n\tret = drmIoctl(fd, 0xc1186451/*amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl*/, \u0026arg);\n}\n\nDue to the address and size are not valid there is a failure in\namdgpu_hmm_register-\u003emmu_interval_notifier_insert-\u003e__mmu_interval_notifier_insert-\u003e\ncheck_shl_overflow, but we even the amdgpu_hmm_register failure we still call\namdgpu_hmm_unregister into  amdgpu_gem_object_free which causes access to a bad address.\nThe following stack is below when the issue is reproduced when Kazan is enabled:\n\n[  +0.000014] Hardware name: ASUS System Product Name/ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI), BIOS 1401 12/03/2020\n[  +0.000009] RIP: 0010:mmu_interval_notifier_remove+0x327/0x340\n[  +0.000017] Code: ff ff 49 89 44 24 08 48 b8 00 01 00 00 00 00 ad de 4c 89 f7 49 89 47 40 48 83 c0 22 49 89 47 48 e8 ce d1 2d 01 e9 32 ff ff ff \u003c0f\u003e 0b e9 16 ff ff ff 4c 89 ef e8 fa 14 b3 ff e9 36 ff ff ff e8 80\n[  +0.000014] RSP: 0018:ffffc90002657988 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[  +0.000013] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 1ffff920004caf35 RCX: ffffffff8160565b\n[  +0.000011] RDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: 0000000000000004 RDI: ffff8881a9f78260\n[  +0.000010] RBP: ffffc90002657a70 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: fffff520004caf25\n[  +0.000010] R10: 0000000000000003 R11: ffffffff8161d1d6 R12: ffff88810e988c00\n[  +0.000010] R13: ffff888126fb5a00 R14: ffff88810e988c0c R15: ffff8881a9f78260\n[  +0.000011] FS:  00007ff9ec848540(0000) GS:ffff8883cc880000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  +0.000012] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  +0.000010] CR2: 000055b3f7e14328 CR3: 00000001b5770000 CR4: 0000000000350ef0\n[  +0.000010] Call Trace:\n[  +0.000006]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  +0.000007]  ? show_regs+0x6a/0x80\n[  +0.000018]  ? __warn+0xa5/0x1b0\n[  +0.000019]  ? mmu_interval_notifier_remove+0x327/0x340\n[  +0.000018]  ? report_bug+0x24a/0x290\n[  +0.000022]  ? handle_bug+0x46/0x90\n[  +0.000015]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x50\n[  +0.000016]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n[  +0.000017]  ? kasan_save_stack+0x26/0x50\n[  +0.000017]  ? mmu_interval_notifier_remove+0x23b/0x340\n[  +0.000019]  ? mmu_interval_notifier_remove+0x327/0x340\n[  +0.000019]  ? mmu_interval_notifier_remove+0x23b/0x340\n[  +0.000020]  ? __pfx_mmu_interval_notifier_remove+0x10/0x10\n[  +0.000017]  ? kasan_save_alloc_info+0x1e/0x30\n[  +0.000018]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n[  +0.000014]  ? __kasan_kmalloc+0xb1/0xc0\n[  +0.000018]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n[  +0.000013]  ? __kasan_check_read+0x11/0x20\n[  +0.000020]  amdgpu_hmm_unregister+0x34/0x50 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004695]  amdgpu_gem_object_free+0x66/0xa0 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004534]  ? __pfx_amdgpu_gem_object_free+0x10/0x10 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004291]  ? do_syscall_64+0x5f/0xe0\n[  +0.000023]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n[  +0.000017]  drm_gem_object_free+0x3b/0x50 [drm]\n[  +0.000489]  amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl+0x306/0x500 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004295]  ? __pfx_amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl+0x10/0x10 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004270]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n[  +0.000014]  ? __this_cpu_preempt_check+0x13/0x20\n[  +0.000015]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n[  +0.000013]  ? sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x57/0xc0\n[  +0.000020]  ? srso_return_thunk+0x5/0x5f\n[  +0.000014]  ? asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x1b/0x20\n[  +0.000022]  ? drm_ioctl_kernel+0x17b/0x1f0 [drm]\n[  +0.000496]  ? __pfx_amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl+0x10/0x10 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004272]  ? drm_ioctl_kernel+0x190/0x1f0 [drm]\n[  +0.000492]  drm_ioctl_kernel+0x140/0x1f0 [drm]\n[  +0.000497]  ? __pfx_amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl+0x10/0x10 [amdgpu]\n[  +0.004297]  ? __pfx_drm_ioctl_kernel+0x10/0x10 [d\n---truncated---(CVE-2024-26656)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()\n\nSyzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind()\nand nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.\n\nWhile migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to\ncomplete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to\ncompletion picks up the folio being written back in\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log\ncreation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.\n\nIn the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of\nwriteback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to\nverify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at\nmount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is\nbroken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback\ncompletion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing\ndevice does not require stable writes, data may be modified without\nwaiting.\n\nFix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to\nfinish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.(CVE-2024-26696)",

Thus causing a deadlock.\n\nIn the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of\nwriteback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to\nverify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at\nmount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is\nbroken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback\ncompletion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing\ndevice does not require stable writes, data may be modified without\nwaiting.\n\nFix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to\nfinish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.",
