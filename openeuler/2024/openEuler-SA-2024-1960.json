      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nefi: libstub: only free priv.runtime_map when allocated\n\npriv.runtime_map is only allocated when efi_novamap is not set.\nOtherwise, it is an uninitialized value.  In the error path, it is freed\nunconditionally.  Avoid passing an uninitialized value to free_pool.\nFree priv.runtime_map only when it was allocated.\n\nThis bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis\nSecurity Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.(CVE-2024-33619)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount\n\nThe current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level\nmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer\nto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can\nlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region\nduring programming if the parent device does not have a driver.\n\nTo address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region\nstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for\nregistering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and\nrename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper\nmacros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the\nowner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules\nand reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.\n\nAlso, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface\nfor registering an fpga region.(CVE-2024-35247)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neeprom: at24: fix memory corruption race condition\n\nIf the eeprom is not accessible, an nvmem device will be registered, the\nread will fail, and the device will be torn down. If another driver\naccesses the nvmem device after the teardown, it will reference\ninvalid memory.\n\nMove the failure point before registering the nvmem device.(CVE-2024-35848)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix module reference leakage from bdev_open_by_dev error path\n\nAt the time bdev_may_open() is called, module reference is grabbed\nalready, hence module reference should be released if bdev_may_open()\nfailed.\n\nThis problem is found by code review.(CVE-2024-35859)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: RFCOMM: Fix not validating setsockopt user input\n\nsyzbot reported rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old() is copying data without\nchecking user input length.\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in copy_from_sockptr_offset\ninclude/linux/sockptr.h:49 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in copy_from_sockptr\ninclude/linux/sockptr.h:55 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old\nnet/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c:632 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in rfcomm_sock_setsockopt+0x893/0xa70\nnet/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c:673\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff8880209a8bc3 by task syz-executor632/5064(CVE-2024-35966)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers\n\nCurrently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer that\nwill lead to a crash.  An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show().\n\n   171\tchar *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i);\n   172\tif (IS_ERR(label)) {\n   173\t\tdev_err(wm831x-\u003edev, \"Failed to duplicate label\\n\");\n   174\t\tcontinue;\n   175  }\n\nThe auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well,\notherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.(CVE-2024-36890)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal\n\nTesting with KASAN and syzkaller revealed a bug in port.c:disable_store():\nusb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL if the hub that the port belongs to\nis concurrently removed, but the function does not check for this\npossibility before dereferencing the returned value.\n\nIt turns out that the first dereference is unnecessary, since hub-\u003eintfdev\nis the parent of the port device, so it can be changed easily.  Adding a\ncheck for hub == NULL prevents further problems.\n\nThe same bug exists in the disable_show() routine, and it can be fixed the\nsame way.(CVE-2024-36896)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify\n\nThe use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file\nis being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed\nby bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier\nchain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO\nchip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's\nread rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of\nwatched_lines.\n\nHere is the typical stack when issue happened:\n\n[free]\ngpio_chrdev_release()\n  --\u003e bitmap_free(cdev-\u003ewatched_lines)                  \u003c-- freed\n  --\u003e blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()\n    --\u003e down_write(\u0026nh-\u003erwsem)                          \u003c-- waiting rwsem\n          --\u003e __down_write_common()\n            --\u003e rwsem_down_write_slowpath()\n                  --\u003e schedule_preempt_disabled()\n                    --\u003e schedule()\n\n[use]\nst54spi_gpio_dev_release()\n  --\u003e gpio_free()\n    --\u003e gpiod_free()\n      --\u003e gpiod_free_commit()\n        --\u003e gpiod_line_state_notify()\n          --\u003e blocking_notifier_call_chain()\n            --\u003e down_read(\u0026nh-\u003erwsem);                  \u003c-- held rwsem\n            --\u003e notifier_call_chain()\n              --\u003e lineinfo_changed_notify()\n                --\u003e test_bit(xxxx, cdev-\u003ewatched_lines) \u003c-- use after free\n\nThe side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is\nbeing generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev\nis being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.\n\nTo fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration\nof lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.(CVE-2024-36899)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: prevent NULL dereference in ip6_output()\n\nAccording to syzbot, there is a chance that ip6_dst_idev()\nreturns NULL in ip6_output(). Most places in IPv6 stack\ndeal with a NULL idev just fine, but not here.\n\nsyzbot reported:\n\ngeneral protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc00000000bc: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x00000000000005e0-0x00000000000005e7]\nCPU: 0 PID: 9775 Comm: syz-executor.4 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc5-syzkaller-00157-g6a30653b604a #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 03/27/2024\n RIP: 0010:ip6_output+0x231/0x3f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:237\nCode: 3c 1e 00 49 89 df 74 08 4c 89 ef e8 19 58 db f7 48 8b 44 24 20 49 89 45 00 49 89 c5 48 8d 9d e0 05 00 00 48 89 d8 48 c1 e8 03 \u003c42\u003e 0f b6 04 38 84 c0 4c 8b 74 24 28 0f 85 61 01 00 00 8b 1b 31 ff\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000927f0d8 EFLAGS: 00010202\nRAX: 00000000000000bc RBX: 00000000000005e0 RCX: 0000000000040000\nRDX: ffffc900131f9000 RSI: 0000000000004f47 RDI: 0000000000004f48\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: ffffffff8a1f0b9a R09: 1ffffffff1f51fad\nR10: dffffc0000000000 R11: fffffbfff1f51fae R12: ffff8880293ec8c0\nR13: ffff88805d7fc000 R14: 1ffff1100527d91a R15: dffffc0000000000\nFS:  00007f135c6856c0(0000) GS:ffff8880b9400000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000020000080 CR3: 0000000064096000 CR4: 00000000003506f0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n  NF_HOOK include/linux/netfilter.h:314 [inline]\n  ip6_xmit+0xefe/0x17f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:358\n  sctp_v6_xmit+0x9f2/0x13f0 net/sctp/ipv6.c:248\n  sctp_packet_transmit+0x26ad/0x2ca0 net/sctp/output.c:653\n  sctp_packet_singleton+0x22c/0x320 net/sctp/outqueue.c:783\n  sctp_outq_flush_ctrl net/sctp/outqueue.c:914 [inline]\n  sctp_outq_flush+0x6d5/0x3e20 net/sctp/outqueue.c:1212\n  sctp_side_effects net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c:1198 [inline]\n  sctp_do_sm+0x59cc/0x60c0 net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c:1169\n  sctp_primitive_ASSOCIATE+0x95/0xc0 net/sctp/primitive.c:73\n  __sctp_connect+0x9cd/0xe30 net/sctp/socket.c:1234\n  sctp_connect net/sctp/socket.c:4819 [inline]\n  sctp_inet_connect+0x149/0x1f0 net/sctp/socket.c:4834\n  __sys_connect_file net/socket.c:2048 [inline]\n  __sys_connect+0x2df/0x310 net/socket.c:2065\n  __do_sys_connect net/socket.c:2075 [inline]\n  __se_sys_connect net/socket.c:2072 [inline]\n  __x64_sys_connect+0x7a/0x90 net/socket.c:2072\n  do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n  do_syscall_64+0xf5/0x240 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f(CVE-2024-36901)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nReapply \"drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait\"\n\nThis reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea.\n\nStephen Rostedt reports:\n \"I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up.\n  Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was:\n\n  [   93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK\n  [   93.667730] Running tests on all trace events:\n  [   93.669757] Testing all events: OK\n  [   95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  Timed out after 60 seconds\"\n\nand further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependency\nbetween the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking.\n\nReverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completion again.\n\n[ This may obviously result in the \"[TTM] Buffer eviction failed\"\n  messages again, which was the reason for that original revert.

This was presumably not\nthe intent since the unix extended bits are handled explicitly and\nconditionally on .u.(CVE-2024-36964)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Add a timeout to acquire the command queue semaphore\n\nPrevent forced completion handling on an entry that has not yet been\nassigned an index, causing an out of bounds access on idx = -22.\nInstead of waiting indefinitely for the sem, blocking flow now waits for\nindex to be allocated or a sem acquisition timeout before beginning the\ntimer for FW completion.\n\nKernel log example:\nmlx5_core 0000:06:00.0: wait_func_handle_exec_timeout:1128:(pid 185911): cmd[-22]: CREATE_UCTX(0xa04) No done completion(CVE-2024-38556)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrcu: Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info()\n\nThe rcuc-starvation output from print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow the\nbuffer if there is a huge difference in jiffies difference.  The situation\nmight seem improbable, but computers sometimes get very confused about\ntime, which can result in full-sized integers, and, in this case,\nbuffer overflow.\n\nAlso, the unsigned jiffies difference is printed using %ld, which is\nnormally for signed integers.  This is intentional for debugging purposes,\nbut it is not obvious from the code.\n\nThis commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() and adds a\nclarifying comment about intention of %ld format.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.(CVE-2024-38576)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: Fix deadlocks with kctl removals at disconnection\n\nIn snd_card_disconnect(), we set card-\u003eshutdown flag at the beginning,\ncall callbacks and do sync for card-\u003epower_ref_sleep waiters at the\nend.  The callback may delete a kctl element, and this can lead to a\ndeadlock when the device was in the suspended state.  Namely:\n\n* A process waits for the power up at snd_power_ref_and_wait() in\n  snd_ctl_info() or read/write() inside card-\u003econtrols_rwsem.\n\n* The system gets disconnected meanwhile, and the driver tries to\n  delete a kctl via snd_ctl_remove*(); it tries to take\n  card-\u003econtrols_rwsem again, but this is already locked by the\n  above.  Since the sleeper isn't woken up, this deadlocks.\n\nAn easy fix is to wake up sleepers before processing the driver\ndisconnect callbacks but right after setting the card-\u003eshutdown flag.\nThen all sleepers will abort immediately, and the code flows again.\n\nSo, basically this patch moves the wait_event() call at the right\ntiming.  While we're at it, just to be sure, call wait_event_all()\ninstead of wait_event(), although we don't use exclusive events on\nthis queue for now.(CVE-2024-38600)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW\n\nThe function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL)\nfeature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to\nthe firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA\nbuffer in memory and returns an array containing the number of\naccelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW.\nThe pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data data\nstructure called slice_cnt.\n\nThe array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data()\nto report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators.\nAn incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an out\nof bounds memory read.\nAt the moment, there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong\nvalue, but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.(CVE-2024-38606)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmacintosh/via-macii: Fix \"BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context\"\n\nThe via-macii ADB driver calls request_irq() after disabling hard\ninterrupts. But disabling interrupts isn't necessary here because the\nVIA shift register interrupt was masked during VIA1 initialization.(CVE-2024-38607)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkunit/fortify: Fix mismatched kvalloc()/vfree() usage\n\nThe kv*() family of tests were accidentally freeing with vfree() instead\nof kvfree(). Use kvfree() instead.(CVE-2024-38617)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: add error handle to avoid out-of-bounds\n\nif the sdma_v4_0_irq_id_to_seq return -EINVAL, the process should\nbe stop to avoid out-of-bounds read, so directly return -EINVAL.(CVE-2024-39471)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Fix input format query of process modules without base extension\n\nIf a process module does not have base config extension then the same\nformat applies to all of it's inputs and the process-\u003ebase_config_ext is\nNULL, causing NULL dereference when specifically crafted topology and\nsequences used.(CVE-2024-39473)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: savage: Handle err return when savagefb_check_var failed\n\nThe commit 04e5eac8f3ab(\"fbdev: savage: Error out if pixclock equals zero\")\nchecks the value of pixclock to avoid divide-by-zero error. However\nthe function savagefb_probe doesn't handle the error return of\nsavagefb_check_var. When pixclock is 0, it will cause divide-by-zero error.(CVE-2024-39475)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mc: Fix graph walk in media_pipeline_start\n\nThe graph walk tries to follow all links, even if they are not between\npads. This causes a crash with, e.g. a MEDIA_LNK_FL_ANCILLARY_LINK link.\n\nFix this by allowing the walk to proceed only for MEDIA_LNK_FL_DATA_LINK\nlinks.(CVE-2024-39481)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/drm_file: Fix pid refcounting race\n\n\u003cmaarten.lankhorst@linux.intel.com\u003e, Maxime Ripard\n\u003cmripard@kernel.org\u003e, Thomas Zimmermann \u003ctzimmermann@suse.de\u003e\n\nfilp-\u003epid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer; however, before this\npatch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a struct\npid after storing a pointer to it in filp-\u003epid and dropping the\ndev-\u003efilelist_mutex, making the following race possible:\n\nprocess A               process B\n=========               =========\n                        begin drm_file_update_pid\n                        mutex_lock(\u0026dev-\u003efilelist_mutex)\n                        rcu_replace_pointer(filp-\u003epid, \u003cpid B\u003e, 1)\n                        mutex_unlock(\u0026dev-\u003efilelist_mutex)\nbegin drm_file_update_pid\nmutex_lock(\u0026dev-\u003efilelist_mutex)\nrcu_replace_pointer(filp-\u003epid, \u003cpid A\u003e, 1)\nmutex_unlock(\u0026dev-\u003efilelist_mutex)\nget_pid(\u003cpid A\u003e)\nsynchronize_rcu()\nput_pid(\u003cpid B\u003e)   *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here ***\n                        get_pid(\u003cpid B\u003e)   *** UAF ***\n                        synchronize_rcu()\n                        put_pid(\u003cpid A\u003e)\n\nAs far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y\nbecause it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is not\nexplicitly calling into the scheduler.\n\nThis race leads to use-after-free of a \"struct pid\".\nIt is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass\nthrough a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is between\nmutex_unlock() and get_pid().\n\nFix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pid\nis stored in the file, an extra reference to the pid has been taken.\n\nThis fix also removes the condition for synchronize_rcu(); I think\nthat optimization is unnecessary complexity, since in that case we\nwould usually have bailed out on the lockless check above.(CVE-2024-39486)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qat - Fix ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC memory leak\n\nUsing completion_done to determine whether the caller has gone\naway only works after a complete call.  Furthermore it's still\npossible that the caller has not yet called wait_for_completion,\nresulting in another potential UAF.\n\nFix this by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing\nthe memory safely.(CVE-2024-39493)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free due to race with dev replace\n\nWhile loading a zone's info during creation of a block group, we can race\nwith a device replace operation and then trigger a use-after-free on the\ndevice that was just replaced (source device of the replace operation).\n\nThis happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from\nthe chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not\nunder the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device\nreplace operation happening when we extract the device and that device\nis the source of the replace operation, we will trigger a use-after-free\nif before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and\nfrees the device.\n\nFix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the\ndevice replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the\ncritical section.(CVE-2024-39496)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: Fix race between namespace cleanup and gc in the list:set type\n\nLion Ackermann reported that there is a race condition between namespace cleanup\nin ipset and the garbage collection of the list:set type. The namespace\ncleanup can destroy the list:set type of sets while the gc of the set type is\nwaiting to run in rcu cleanup. The latter uses data from the destroyed set which\nthus leads use after free. The patch contains the following parts:\n\n- When destroying all sets, first remove the garbage collectors, then wait\n  if needed and then destroy the sets.\n- Fix the badly ordered \"wait then remove gc\" for the destroy a single set\n  case.\n- Fix the missing rcu locking in the list:set type in the userspace test\n  case.\n- Use proper RCU list handlings in the list:set type.\n\nThe patch depends on c1193d9bbbd3 (netfilter: ipset: Add list flush to cancel_gc).(CVE-2024-39503)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: remove requests from xarray during flushing requests  Even with CACHEFILES_DEAD set, we can still read the requests, so in the following concurrency the request may be used after it has been freed:       mount  |   daemon_thread1    |    daemon_thread2 ------------------------------------------------------------  cachefiles_ondemand_init_object   cachefiles_ondemand_send_req    REQ_A = kzalloc(sizeof(*req) + data_len)    wait_for_completion(\u0026REQ_A-\u003edone)             cachefiles_daemon_read              cachefiles_ondemand_daemon_read                                   // close dev fd                                   cachefiles_flush_reqs                                    complete(\u0026REQ_A-\u003edone)    kfree(REQ_A)               xa_lock(\u0026cache-\u003ereqs);               cachefiles_ondemand_select_req                 req-\u003emsg.opcode != CACHEFILES_OP_READ                 // req use-after-free !!!               xa_unlock(\u0026cache-\u003ereqs);                                    xa_destroy(\u0026cache-\u003ereqs)  Hence remove requests from cache-\u003ereqs when flushing them to avoid accessing freed requests.(CVE-2024-40900)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Always stop health timer during driver removal\n\nCurrently, if teardown_hca fails to execute during driver removal, mlx5\ndoes not stop the health timer.

Verification Center\n(linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.\n\n[0]: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=d327a1f3b12e1e206c16(CVE-2024-41006)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix too early release of tcx_entry\n\nPedro Pinto and later independently also Hyunwoo Kim and Wongi Lee reported\nan issue that the tcx_entry can be released too early leading to a use\nafter free (UAF) when an active old-style ingress or clsact qdisc with a\nshared tc block is later replaced by another ingress or clsact instance.\n\nEssentially, the sequence to trigger the UAF (one example) can be as follows:\n\n  1. A network namespace is created\n  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and\n     \u0026tcx_entry-\u003eminiq is stored in the qdisc's miniqp-\u003ep_miniq. At the\n     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.\n  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to\n     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function\n     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.\n  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc\n     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked\n     tcx_entry:\n\n     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()\n       =\u003e tc_modify_qdisc()\n         =\u003e qdisc_create()\n           =\u003e clsact_init() [a]\n         =\u003e qdisc_graft()\n           =\u003e qdisc_destroy()\n             =\u003e __qdisc_destroy()\n               =\u003e ingress_destroy() [b]\n                 =\u003e tcx_entry_free()\n                   =\u003e kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed\n\n  5. Finally, the network namespace is closed. This registers the\n     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the\n     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was\n     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:\n\n     cleanup_net()\n       =\u003e ops_exit_list()\n         =\u003e default_device_exit_batch()\n           =\u003e unregister_netdevice_many()\n             =\u003e unregister_netdevice_many_notify()\n               =\u003e dev_shutdown()\n                 =\u003e qdisc_put()\n                   =\u003e clsact_destroy() [c]\n                     =\u003e tcf_block_put_ext()\n                       =\u003e tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()\n                         =\u003e tcf_chain_head_change_item()\n                           =\u003e clsact_chain_head_change()\n                             =\u003e mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAF\n\nThere are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)\nqdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waiting\nfor the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessing\nthe current active qdisc's miniq one way or another.\n\nThe correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. What\ncan be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0-\u003e1, at\nstep [a] from 1-\u003e2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active during\nthe replacement), then in [b] from 2-\u003e1 and finally [c] 1-\u003e0 with the\neventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] and\nit does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protected\nby the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happening\nand the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time.(CVE-2024-41010)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfs: don't walk off the end of a directory data block\n\nThis adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry\nto make sure don't stray beyond valid memory region. Before patching, the\nloop simply checks that the start offset of the dup and dep is within the\nrange. So in a crafted image, if last entry is xfs_dir2_data_unused, we\ncan change dup-\u003elength to dup-\u003elength-1 and leave 1 byte of space. In the\nnext traversal, this space will be considered as dup or dep. We may\nencounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.\n\nIn the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold\nan unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and\nxfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make\nsure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a\nsingle-byte name before accessing xfs_dir2_data_entry.(CVE-2024-41013)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data\n\nThere is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed members\nof xlog_op_header in the xlog_recover_process_data.\n\nWe can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read by\nfollowing these steps:\n    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records\n    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate\n       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and\n       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter\n       xlog_recover_process_data\n    3) Write a tool to parse and modify the copied image in step 2\n    4) Make the end of the xlog_op_header entries only 1 byte away from\n       xlog_rec_header-\u003eh_size\n    5) xlog_rec_header-\u003eh_num_logops++\n    6) Modify xlog_rec_header-\u003eh_crc\n\nFix:\nAdd a check to make sure there is sufficient space to access fixed members\nof xlog_op_header.(CVE-2024-41014)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: Add a check for attr_names and oatbl\n\nAdded out-of-bound checking for *ane (ATTR_NAME_ENTRY).(CVE-2024-41018)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: Validate ff offset\n\nThis adds sanity checks for ff offset. There is a check\non rt-\u003efirst_free at first, but walking through by ff\nwithout any check. If the second ff is a large offset.\nWe may encounter an out-of-bound read.(CVE-2024-41019)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfilelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path\n\nWhen I wrote commit 3cad1bc01041 (\"filelock: Remove locks reliably when\nfcntl/close race is detected\"), I missed that there are two copies of the\ncode I was patching: The normal version, and the version for 64-bit offsets\non 32-bit kernels.\nThanks to Greg KH for stumbling over this while doing the stable\nbackport...\n\nApply exactly the same fix to the compat path for 32-bit kernels.(CVE-2024-41020)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()\n\nThere is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on\ns390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in\ndo_exception().\n\nHowever, since commit af19487f00f3 (\"mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more\ngeneral\"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with\nPTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON\notherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().\n\nFix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar\nto x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault\nflags, for easier debugging.\n\nNote that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot\nsupport swap entries on other levels than PTE level.(CVE-2024-41021)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/deadline: Fix task_struct reference leak\n\nDuring the execution of the following stress test with linux-rt:\n\nstress-ng --cyclic 30 --timeout 30 --minimize --quiet\n\nkmemleak frequently reported a memory leak concerning the task_struct:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881305b8000 (size 16136):\n  comm \"stress-ng\", pid 614, jiffies 4294883961 (age 286.412s)\n  object hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    02 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  .@..............\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  debug hex dump (first 16 bytes):\n    53 09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  S...............\n  backtrace:\n    [\u003c00000000046b6790\u003e] dup_task_struct+0x30/0x540\n    [\u003c00000000c5ca0f0b\u003e] copy_process+0x3d9/0x50e0\n    [\u003c00000000ced59777\u003e] kernel_clone+0xb0/0x770\n    [\u003c00000000a50befdc\u003e] __do_sys_clone+0xb6/0xf0\n    [\u003c000000001dbf2008\u003e] do_syscall_64+0x5d/0xf0\n    [\u003c00000000552900ff\u003e] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76\n\nThe issue occurs in start_dl_timer(), which increments the task_struct\nreference count and sets a timer. The timer callback, dl_task_timer,\nis supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,\nif enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,\nthe reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.\n\nThis patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct\nreference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.(CVE-2024-41023)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: cs_dsp: Fix overflow checking of wmfw header\n\nFix the checking that firmware file buffer is large enough for the\nwmfw header, to prevent overrunning the buffer.\n\nThe original code tested that the firmware data buffer contained\nenough bytes for the sums of the size of the structs\n\n\twmfw_header + wmfw_adsp1_sizes + wmfw_footer\n\nBut wmfw_adsp1_sizes is only used on ADSP1 firmware. For ADSP2 and\nHalo Core the equivalent struct is wmfw_adsp2_sizes, which is\n4 bytes longer. So the length check didn't guarantee that there\nare enough bytes in the firmware buffer for a header with\nwmfw_adsp2_sizes.\n\nThis patch splits the length check into three separate parts. Each\nof the wmfw_header, wmfw_adsp?_sizes and wmfw_footer are checked\nseparately before they are used.(CVE-2024-41039)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix UAF when resolving a clash\n\nKASAN reports the following UAF:\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in tcf_ct_flow_table_process_conn+0x12b/0x380 [act_ct]\n Read of size 1 at addr ffff888c07603600 by task handler130/6469\n\n Call Trace:\n  \u003cIRQ\u003e\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x48/0x70\n  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x33/0x3d0\n  print_report+0xc0/0x2b0\n  kasan_report+0xd0/0x120\n  __asan_load1+0x6c/0x80\n  tcf_ct_flow_table_process_conn+0x12b/0x380 [act_ct]\n  tcf_ct_act+0x886/0x1350 [act_ct]\n  tcf_action_exec+0xf8/0x1f0\n  fl_classify+0x355/0x360 [cls_flower]\n  __tcf_classify+0x1fd/0x330\n  tcf_classify+0x21c/0x3c0\n  sch_handle_ingress.constprop.0+0x2c5/0x500\n  __netif_receive_skb_core.constprop.0+0xb25/0x1510\n  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x220/0x4c0\n  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x446/0x620\n  napi_complete_done+0x157/0x3d0\n  gro_cell_poll+0xcf/0x100\n  __napi_poll+0x65/0x310\n  net_rx_action+0x30c/0x5c0\n  __do_softirq+0x14f/0x491\n  __irq_exit_rcu+0x82/0xc0\n  irq_exit_rcu+0xe/0x20\n  common_interrupt+0xa1/0xb0\n  \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n  \u003cTASK\u003e\n  asm_common_interrupt+0x27/0x40\n\n Allocated by task 6469:\n  kasan_save_stack+0x38/0x70\n  kasan_set_track+0x25/0x40\n  kasan_save_alloc_info+0x1e/0x40\n  __kasan_krealloc+0x133/0x190\n  krealloc+0xaa/0x130\n  nf_ct_ext_add+0xed/0x230 [nf_conntrack]\n  tcf_ct_act+0x1095/0x1350 [act_ct]\n  tcf_action_exec+0xf8/0x1f0\n  fl_classify+0x355/0x360 [cls_flower]\n  __tcf_classify+0x1fd/0x330\n  tcf_classify+0x21c/0x3c0\n  sch_handle_ingress.constprop.0+0x2c5/0x500\n  __netif_receive_skb_core.constprop.0+0xb25/0x1510\n  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x220/0x4c0\n  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x446/0x620\n  napi_complete_done+0x157/0x3d0\n  gro_cell_poll+0xcf/0x100\n  __napi_poll+0x65/0x310\n  net_rx_action+0x30c/0x5c0\n  __do_softirq+0x14f/0x491\n\n Freed by task 6469:\n  kasan_save_stack+0x38/0x70\n  kasan_set_track+0x25/0x40\n  kasan_save_free_info+0x2b/0x60\n  ____kasan_slab_free+0x180/0x1f0\n  __kasan_slab_free+0x12/0x30\n  slab_free_freelist_hook+0xd2/0x1a0\n  __kmem_cache_free+0x1a2/0x2f0\n  kfree+0x78/0x120\n  nf_conntrack_free+0x74/0x130 [nf_conntrack]\n  nf_ct_destroy+0xb2/0x140 [nf_conntrack]\n  __nf_ct_resolve_clash+0x529/0x5d0 [nf_conntrack]\n  nf_ct_resolve_clash+0xf6/0x490 [nf_conntrack]\n  __nf_conntrack_confirm+0x2c6/0x770 [nf_conntrack]\n  tcf_ct_act+0x12ad/0x1350 [act_ct]\n  tcf_action_exec+0xf8/0x1f0\n  fl_classify+0x355/0x360 [cls_flower]\n  __tcf_classify+0x1fd/0x330\n  tcf_classify+0x21c/0x3c0\n  sch_handle_ingress.constprop.0+0x2c5/0x500\n  __netif_receive_skb_core.constprop.0+0xb25/0x1510\n  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x220/0x4c0\n  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x446/0x620\n  napi_complete_done+0x157/0x3d0\n  gro_cell_poll+0xcf/0x100\n  __napi_poll+0x65/0x310\n  net_rx_action+0x30c/0x5c0\n  __do_softirq+0x14f/0x491\n\nThe ct may be dropped if a clash has been resolved but is still passed to\nthe tcf_ct_flow_table_process_conn function for further usage.

Since\nthis relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock\nsituation as the previous patch.\n\nIt would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,\nas the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once\nasync_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized\nbefore it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to\narm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is\nsufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return\nHRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.\n\nHowever, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer\nbefore entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to\ntimer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback\nrunning concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is\nsignificantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration\nhappening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it\nthe struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.\n\nHence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after\nasync_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock\nissues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the\nglobal workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at\n_different_ points of time, so can share space).\n\nUpdate existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs.(CVE-2024-41045)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nskmsg: Skip zero length skb in sk_msg_recvmsg\n\nWhen running BPF selftests (./test_progs -t sockmap_basic) on a Loongarch\nplatform, the following kernel panic occurs:\n\n  [...]\n  Oops[#1]:\n  CPU: 22 PID: 2824 Comm: test_progs Tainted: G           OE  6.10.0-rc2+ #18\n  Hardware name: LOONGSON Dabieshan/Loongson-TC542F0, BIOS Loongson-UDK2018\n     ... ...\n     ra: 90000000048bf6c0 sk_msg_recvmsg+0x120/0x560\n    ERA: 9000000004162774 copy_page_to_iter+0x74/0x1c0\n   CRMD: 000000b0 (PLV0 -IE -DA +PG DACF=CC DACM=CC -WE)\n   PRMD: 0000000c (PPLV0 +PIE +PWE)\n   EUEN: 00000007 (+FPE +SXE +ASXE -BTE)\n   ECFG: 00071c1d (LIE=0,2-4,10-12 VS=7)\n  ESTAT: 00010000 [PIL] (IS= ECode=1 EsubCode=0)\n   BADV: 0000000000000040\n   PRID: 0014c011 (Loongson-64bit, Loongson-3C5000)\n  Modules linked in: bpf_testmod(OE) xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack\n  Process test_progs (pid: 2824, threadinfo=0000000000863a31, task=...)\n  Stack : ...\n  Call Trace:\n  [\u003c9000000004162774\u003e] copy_page_to_iter+0x74/0x1c0\n  [\u003c90000000048bf6c0\u003e] sk_msg_recvmsg+0x120/0x560\n  [\u003c90000000049f2b90\u003e] tcp_bpf_recvmsg_parser+0x170/0x4e0\n  [\u003c90000000049aae34\u003e] inet_recvmsg+0x54/0x100\n  [\u003c900000000481ad5c\u003e] sock_recvmsg+0x7c/0xe0\n  [\u003c900000000481e1a8\u003e] __sys_recvfrom+0x108/0x1c0\n  [\u003c900000000481e27c\u003e] sys_recvfrom+0x1c/0x40\n  [\u003c9000000004c076ec\u003e] do_syscall+0x8c/0xc0\n  [\u003c9000000003731da4\u003e] handle_syscall+0xc4/0x160\n  Code: ...\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception\n  Kernel relocated by 0x3510000\n   .text @ 0x9000000003710000\n   .data @ 0x9000000004d70000\n   .bss  @ 0x9000000006469400\n  ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception ]---\n  [...]\n\nThis crash happens every time when running sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown\nsubtest in sockmap_basic.\n\nThis crash is because a NULL pointer is passed to page_address() in the\nsk_msg_recvmsg(). Due to the different implementations depending on the\narchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch\nplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform\nfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause\nis that a zero length skb (skb-\u003elen == 0) was put on the queue.\n\nThis zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),\ninvoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\n\n\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);\n\nIn this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no\npage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty\nsge is queued into ingress_msg list.\n\nAnd in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by\nsg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it\nto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.\n\nTo solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),\nif copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking\ncopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by\ncopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.(CVE-2024-41048)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfilelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode\n\nLight Hsieh reported a KASAN UAF warning in trace_posix_lock_inode().\nThe request pointer had been changed earlier to point to a lock entry\nthat was added to the inode's list.

As a result, the request\ncorresponding to this object is always skipped in select_req function, so\nthe read request is never completed and blocks other process.\n\nFix this issue by simply set object to close if its id \u003c 0 in copen.(CVE-2024-41074)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread\n\nThis prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread\nrequests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:\n\n  * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only\n    complete read requests.\n  * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the\n    request has not been read by the daemon.\n  * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.(CVE-2024-41075)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4: Fix memory leak in nfs4_set_security_label\n\nWe leak nfs_fattr and nfs4_label every time we set a security xattr.(CVE-2024-41076)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnull_blk: fix validation of block size\n\nBlock size should be between 512 and PAGE_SIZE and be a power of 2. The current\ncheck does not validate this, so update the check.\n\nWithout this patch, null_blk would Oops due to a null pointer deref when\nloaded with bs=1536 [1].\n\n\n[axboe: remove unnecessary braces and != 0 check](CVE-2024-41077)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()\n\nThe io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(),\nwhich acquires the sqd-\u003elock without releasing the uring_lock.\nSimilar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (\"io_uring: drop ctx-\u003euring_lock\nbefore acquiring sqd-\u003elock\"), this can lead to a potential deadlock\nsituation.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling\nio_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.\n\nThis change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct\norder, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.(CVE-2024-41080)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling\n\nWhen CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxl\nendpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace.\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000078\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n RIP: 0010:cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]\n Call Trace:\n  \u003cTASK\u003e\n  ? __die+0x24/0x70\n  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160\n  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x65/0x6b0\n  ? exc_page_fault+0x7d/0x170\n  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n  ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]\n  ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x1ac/0x360 [cxl_pmem]\n  cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]\n  really_probe+0x173/0x410\n  ? __pfx___device_attach_driver+0x10/0x10\n  __driver_probe_device+0x80/0x170\n  driver_probe_device+0x1e/0x90\n  __device_attach_driver+0x90/0x120\n  bus_for_each_drv+0x84/0xe0\n  __device_attach+0xbc/0x1f0\n  bus_probe_device+0x90/0xa0\n  device_add+0x51c/0x710\n  devm_cxl_add_pmem_region+0x1b5/0x380 [cxl_core]\n  cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]\n\nThe cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem region\nprobe.

Adjust the\nsequence so this dependency is met.\n\nThis requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that\ncan be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not\nyet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so\nstart the query from there instead.(CVE-2024-41085)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntap: add missing verification for short frame\n\nThe cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length\nin the tap_get_user_xdp() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be\nsent downstack.

This approach is problematic since it can\nlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region\nduring programming if the parent device does not have a driver.\n\nTo address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region\nstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for\nregistering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and\nrename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper\nmacros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the\nowner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules\nand reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.\n\nAlso, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface\nfor registering an fpga region.",

Additionally, one of the GPIO\nchip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's\nread rwsem.

A network namespace is created  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and     \u0026tcx_entry-\u003eminiq is stored in the qdisc s miniqp-\u003ep_miniq. At the     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked     tcx_entry:     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()       =\u003e tc_modify_qdisc()         =\u003e qdisc_create()           =\u003e clsact_init() [a]         =\u003e qdisc_graft()           =\u003e qdisc_destroy()             =\u003e __qdisc_destroy()               =\u003e ingress_destroy() [b]                 =\u003e tcx_entry_free()                   =\u003e kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed  5.

This registers the     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:     cleanup_net()       =\u003e ops_exit_list()         =\u003e default_device_exit_batch()           =\u003e unregister_netdevice_many()             =\u003e unregister_netdevice_many_notify()               =\u003e dev_shutdown()                 =\u003e qdisc_put()                   =\u003e clsact_destroy() [c]                     =\u003e tcf_block_put_ext()                       =\u003e tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()                         =\u003e tcf_chain_head_change_item()                           =\u003e clsact_chain_head_change()                             =\u003e mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAFThere are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)qdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waitingfor the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessingthe current active qdisc s miniq one way or another.The correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. Whatcan be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0-\u003e1, atstep [a] from 1-\u003e2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active duringthe replacement), then in [b] from 2-\u003e1 and finally [c] 1-\u003e0 with theeventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] andit does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protectedby the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happeningand the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time.",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free\n\nCurrently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying\nto cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as\nwell, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since\nthis relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock\nsituation as the previous patch.\n\nIt would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,\nas the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once\nasync_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized\nbefore it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to\narm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is\nsufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return\nHRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.\n\nHowever, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer\nbefore entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to\ntimer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback\nrunning concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is\nsignificantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration\nhappening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it\nthe struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.\n\nHence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after\nasync_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock\nissues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the\nglobal workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at\n_different_ points of time, so can share space).\n\nUpdate existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs.",

The root cause\nis that a zero length skb (skb-\u003elen == 0) was put on the queue.\n\nThis zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),\ninvoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\n\n\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);\n\nIn this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no\npage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty\nsge is queued into ingress_msg list.\n\nAnd in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by\nsg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it\nto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.\n\nTo solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),\nif copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking\ncopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by\ncopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.",

It was found that all variables in the jffs_inode_info\nstructure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspected that these\nvariables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a during memory testing,\nwhich is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable is initialized in the\nfunction jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized in\nthe function jffs2_init_inode_info.\n\nThe function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,\nbut in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,\nwhich releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inode\nis not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_locked\nmay enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.\n\nSince the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,\nthe fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once.",
