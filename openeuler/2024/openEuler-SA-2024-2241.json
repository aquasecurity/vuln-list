Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA difference in the handling of StructFields and ArrayTypes in WASM could be used to trigger an exploitable type confusion vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 130, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.2.(CVE-2024-8385)\n\nIf a site had been granted the permission to open popup windows, it could cause Select elements to appear on top of another site to perform a spoofing attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 130, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.2.(CVE-2024-8386)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 129, Firefox ESR 128.1, and Thunderbird 128.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 130, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.2.(CVE-2024-8387)\n\nA compromised content process could have allowed for the arbitrary loading of cross-origin pages. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.(CVE-2024-9392)\n\nIt is currently unknown if this issue is exploitable but a condition may arise where the structured clone of certain objects could lead to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.(CVE-2024-9396)\n\nBy checking the result of calls to `window.open` with specifically set protocol handlers, an attacker could determine if the application which implements that protocol handler is installed. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.(CVE-2024-9398)\n\nA potential memory corruption vulnerability could be triggered if an attacker had the ability to trigger an OOM at a specific moment during JIT compilation. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.(CVE-2024-9400)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 130, Firefox ESR 115.15, Firefox ESR 128.2, and Thunderbird 128.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
