The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream-\u003esamples to accommodate stream-\u003en_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",

Specifically, when ccpair_size is even, the allocated size in storage does not match the loop's expected bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.

The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem-\u003eallocator-\u003emem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer.
