      "Text": "Mozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThere was no limit to the number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames that would be processed. A server could abuse this to create an Out of Memory condition in the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 125, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.10, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.10.(CVE-2024-3302)\n\nGetBoundName could return the wrong version of an object when JIT optimizations were applied. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 125, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.10, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.10.(CVE-2024-3852)\n\nIn some code patterns the JIT incorrectly optimized switch statements and generated code with out-of-bounds-reads. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 125, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.10, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.10.(CVE-2024-3854)\n\nOn 32-bit versions there were integer-overflows that led to an out-of-bounds-read that potentially could be triggered by a malformed OpenType font. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 125, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.10, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.10.(CVE-2024-3859)\n\nIf an AlignedBuffer were assigned to itself, the subsequent self-move could result in an incorrect reference count and later use-after-free. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 125, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.10, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.10.(CVE-2024-3861)\n\nIf the `browser.privatebrowsing.autostart` preference is enabled, IndexedDB files were not properly deleted when the window was closed. This preference is disabled by default in Firefox. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 126, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.11.(CVE-2024-4767)\n\nWhen importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the difference between `application/javascript` responses and non-script responses.  This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 126, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.11.(CVE-2024-4769)\n\nOffscreen Canvas did not properly track cross-origin tainting, which could be used to access image data from another site in violation of same-origin policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 127, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.12, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.12.(CVE-2024-5693)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 126, Firefox ESR 115.11, and Thunderbird 115.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 127, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.12, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.12.(CVE-2024-5700)",
