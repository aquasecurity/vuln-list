      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killable\n\nThe USBDEVFS_CONTROL and USBDEVFS_BULK ioctls invoke\nusb_start_wait_urb(), which contains an uninterruptible wait with a\nuser-specified timeout value.  If timeout value is very large and the\ndevice being accessed does not respond in a reasonable amount of time,\nthe kernel will complain about \"Task X blocked for more than N\nseconds\", as found in testing by syzbot:\n\nINFO: task syz-executor.0:8700 blocked for more than 143 seconds.\n      Not tainted 5.14.0-rc7-syzkaller #0\n\"echo 0 \u003e /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\ntask:syz-executor.0  state:D stack:23192 pid: 8700 ppid:  8455 flags:0x00004004\nCall Trace:\n context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:4681 [inline]\n __schedule+0xc07/0x11f0 kernel/sched/core.c:5938\n schedule+0x14b/0x210 kernel/sched/core.c:6017\n schedule_timeout+0x98/0x2f0 kernel/time/timer.c:1857\n do_wait_for_common+0x2da/0x480 kernel/sched/completion.c:85\n __wait_for_common kernel/sched/completion.c:106 [inline]\n wait_for_common kernel/sched/completion.c:117 [inline]\n wait_for_completion_timeout+0x46/0x60 kernel/sched/completion.c:157\n usb_start_wait_urb+0x167/0x550 drivers/usb/core/message.c:63\n do_proc_bulk+0x978/0x1080 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1236\n proc_bulk drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1273 [inline]\n usbdev_do_ioctl drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2547 [inline]\n usbdev_ioctl+0x3441/0x6b10 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2713\n...\n\nTo fix this problem, this patch replaces usbfs's calls to\nusb_control_msg() and usb_bulk_msg() with special-purpose code that\ndoes essentially the same thing (as recommended in the comment for\nusb_start_wait_urb()), except that it always uses a killable wait and\nit uses GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_NOIO.(CVE-2021-47582)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: Fix the behavior of READ near OFFSET_MAX\n\nDan Aloni reports:\n\u003e Due to commit 8cfb9015280d (\"NFS: Always provide aligned buffers to\n\u003e the RPC read layers\") on the client, a read of 0xfff is aligned up\n\u003e to server rsize of 0x1000.\n\u003e\n\u003e As a result, in a test where the server has a file of size\n\u003e 0x7fffffffffffffff, and the client tries to read from the offset\n\u003e 0x7ffffffffffff000, the read causes loff_t overflow in the server\n\u003e and it returns an NFS code of EINVAL to the client. The client as\n\u003e a result indefinitely retries the request.\n\nThe Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all\nNFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a\nREAD.\n\nInstead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed\nand return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent\nthe client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to\nbe consistent with Solaris NFS servers.\n\nNote that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These\nmust be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit\ntype cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks\nagainst sb-\u003es_maxbytes do not work properly.(CVE-2022-48827)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mediatek: vcodec: Only free buffer VA that is not NULL\n\nIn the MediaTek vcodec driver, while mtk_vcodec_mem_free() is mostly\ncalled only when the buffer to free exists, there are some instances\nthat didn't do the check and triggered warnings in practice.\n\nWe believe those checks were forgotten unintentionally. Add the checks\nback to fix the warnings.(CVE-2023-52888)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: core: remove unnecessary WARN_ON() in implement()\n\nSyzkaller hit a warning [1] in a call to implement() when trying\nto write a value into a field of smaller size in an output report.\n\nSince implement() already has a warn message printed out with the\nhelp of hid_warn() and value in question gets trimmed with:\n\t...\n\tvalue \u0026= m;\n\t...\nWARN_ON may be considered superfluous. Remove it to suppress future\nsyzkaller triggers.\n\n[1]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5084 at drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 implement drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 [inline]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5084 at drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 hid_output_report+0x548/0x760 drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1863\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 5084 Comm: syz-executor424 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc7-syzkaller-00183-gcf87f46fd34d #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 04/02/2024\nRIP: 0010:implement drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1451 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:hid_output_report+0x548/0x760 drivers/hid/hid-core.c:1863\n...\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n __usbhid_submit_report drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:591 [inline]\n usbhid_submit_report+0x43d/0x9e0 drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:636\n hiddev_ioctl+0x138b/0x1f00 drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:726\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:904 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xfc/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:890\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xf5/0x240 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n...(CVE-2024-39509)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: mesh: Fix leak of mesh_preq_queue objects\n\nThe hwmp code use objects of type mesh_preq_queue, added to a list in\nieee80211_if_mesh, to keep track of mpath we need to resolve.

This can likely be used\nto read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.\n\nFix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to\nreliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and\nfiles_struct and is also used by filp_flush().(CVE-2024-41012)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix kernel bug on rename operation of broken directory\n\nSyzbot reported that in rename directory operation on broken directory on\nnilfs2, __block_write_begin_int() called to prepare block write may fail\nBUG_ON check for access exceeding the folio/page size.\n\nThis is because nilfs_dotdot(), which gets parent directory reference\nentry (\"..\") of the directory to be moved or renamed, does not check\nconsistency enough, and may return location exceeding folio/page size for\nbroken directories.\n\nFix this issue by checking required directory entries (\".\" and \"..\") in\nthe first chunk of the directory in nilfs_dotdot().(CVE-2024-41034)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor\n\nSyzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)\ncaused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpoint\ndescriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result of\nthe bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly\nother routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for\ndistinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and\nendpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug\nidentified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers\nand directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).\n\nTo fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress\nwhen we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1\nspecs say these bits are \"Reserved, reset to zero\".)  This requires us\nto make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() and\nuse the copy instead of the original when checking for duplicates.(CVE-2024-41035)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate\n\nnft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will\nresult in a call stack overflow (ctx-\u003elevel \u003e= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).\n\nIt also follows maps via -\u003evalidate callback in nft_lookup, so there\nappears no reason to iterate the maps again.\n\nnf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.\nThis improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.\n\nThis also fixes a crash bug.

That commit introduced\nvma-\u003efence-\u003eactive in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait\nselectively on that one instead of vma-\u003eactive since only idleness of\nfence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a\n(\"drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal\") replaced the call to\nfence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and\nalso added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(\u0026fence-\u003eactive)) in front.\nNo justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of\nvma-\u003efence-\u003eactive without first waiting on it.\n\nThe issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence\nregisters on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked\non completion of a request that was using them on the other, still\nprocessed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by\nwaiting for idleness of vma-\u003efence-\u003eactive in i915_vma_revoke_fence().\n\n(cherry picked from commit 24bb052d3dd499c5956abad5f7d8e4fd07da7fb1)(CVE-2024-41092)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panel: ilitek-ili9881c: Fix warning with GPIO controllers that sleep\n\nThe ilitek-ili9881c controls the reset GPIO using the non-sleeping\ngpiod_set_value() function.

We've lost the comment at some point (I think when\nthe 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:\n\n\tAssume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy\n\tof eflags from PUSHF.\n\nwhich explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off the\nstack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just check\nif they might be eflags or the return pc:\n\n\tEflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses\n\nbut that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lock\ndebugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stack\nframe.\n\nIt causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] and\nothers [2].\n\nWith no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.\n\nJust for historical interest, here's some background commits relating to\nthis code from 2006:\n\n  0cb91a229364 (\"i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels\")\n  31679f38d886 (\"Simplify profile_pc on x86-64\")\n\nand a code unification from 2009:\n\n  ef4512882dbe (\"x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc\")\n\nbut the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.(CVE-2024-42096)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: ecdh - explicitly zeroize private_key\n\nprivate_key is overwritten with the key parameter passed in by the\ncaller (if present), or alternatively a newly generated private key.\nHowever, it is possible that the caller provides a key (or the newly\ngenerated key) which is shorter than the previous key. In that\nscenario, some key material from the previous key would not be\noverwritten. The easiest solution is to explicitly zeroize the entire\nprivate_key array first.\n\nNote that this patch slightly changes the behavior of this function:\npreviously, if the ecc_gen_privkey failed, the old private_key would\nremain. Now, the private_key is always zeroized. This behavior is\nconsistent with the case where params.key is set and ecc_is_key_valid\nfails.(CVE-2024-42098)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again\"\n\nPatch series \"mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling\".\n\nDirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into\n32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for\nmore details).\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThis reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.\n\nThe commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast\nfrom the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit\narchs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh \u003e= 1\u003c\u003c32 (which is actually common - the\ndefault settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the\ndiv64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have\ndiv64_ul() in case we want to be safe \u0026 cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty\nthresholds are larger than 1\u003c\u003c32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to\nblow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one\npossible overflow is just moot.(CVE-2024-42102)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix inode number range checks\n\nPatch series \"nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes\".\n\nThis series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by\nnilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted\nfilesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting\nnumber of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is\nintentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  \n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nIn the current implementation of nilfs2, \"nilfs-\u003ens_first_ino\", which\ngives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,\nbut its lower limit is not checked.\n\nAs a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of\nreserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the\nsuper block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and\nNILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.\n\nIn addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with\nthe inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a\nshift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in\nthe C specification, so if \"ns_first_ino\" is set to a large value other\nthan the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially\nmalfunction depending on the environment.\n\nFix these issues by checking the lower bound of \"nilfs-\u003ens_first_ino\" and\nby preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO\nconstant in the inode number test macros.\n\nAlso, change the type of \"ns_first_ino\" from signed integer to unsigned\ninteger to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the\nlower bound check introduced this time.(CVE-2024-42105)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: restrict NL80211_ATTR_TXQ_QUANTUM values\n\nsyzbot is able to trigger softlockups, setting NL80211_ATTR_TXQ_QUANTUM\nto 2^31.\n\nWe had a similar issue in sch_fq, fixed with commit\nd9e15a273306 (\"pkt_sched: fq: do not accept silly TCA_FQ_QUANTUM\")\n\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 26s!

However one of these queues\nis reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set\nto [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if\nit is not.\n\nThis is also described in a comment in the source code in\ndrivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition\nof FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important\nfor this patch\n\n/*\n  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is\n  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the\n  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default\n  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can\n  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such\n  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like\n  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues\n  *\n  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:\n  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of\n  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1\n  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)\n  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues\n  *    is Y+1\n  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for\n  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional\n  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).\n  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE\n  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.\n  */\n\nHowever this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can\nhandle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.\nLooking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally\nusing the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (\"bnx2x: Add 57712 support\").\nBack then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver\nwas later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be\nlimited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the\narray \"stats_query_entry query\" was still limited to using the FP-SB\navailable to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was\nupdated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being\naware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN\nwarnings seen in the stack traces below.\n\nThis patch increases the size of the \"stats_query_entry query\" array by\nreplacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle\nboth types of NICs.\n\nStack traces:\n\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in\n       drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_stats.c:1529:11\nindex 20 is out of range for type 'stats_query_entry [19]'\nCPU: 12 PID: 858 Comm: systemd-network Not tainted 6.9.0-060900rc7-generic\n\t     #202405052133\nHardware name: HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9/ProLiant DL360 \n---truncated---(CVE-2024-42148)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp_metrics: validate source addr length\n\nI don't see anything checking that TCP_METRICS_ATTR_SADDR_IPV4\nis at least 4 bytes long, and the policy doesn't have an entry\nfor this attribute at all (neither does it for IPv6 but v6 is\nmanually validated).(CVE-2024-42154)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/pkey: Wipe copies of clear-key structures on failure\n\nWipe all sensitive data from stack for all IOCTLs, which convert a\nclear-key into a protected- or secure-key.(CVE-2024-42156)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/pkey: Wipe sensitive data on failure\n\nWipe sensitive data from stack also if the copy_to_user() fails.(CVE-2024-42157)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dvb-frontends: tda10048: Fix integer overflow\n\nstate-\u003extal_hz can be up to 16M, so it can overflow a 32 bit integer\nwhen multiplied by pll_mfactor.\n\nCreate a new 64 bit variable to hold the calculations.(CVE-2024-42223)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mt76: replace skb_put with skb_put_zero\n\nAvoid potentially reusing uninitialized data(CVE-2024-42225)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: aead,cipher - zeroize key buffer after use\n\nI.G 9.7.B for FIPS 140-3 specifies that variables temporarily holding\ncryptographic information should be zeroized once they are no longer\nneeded.

Specifically, both port read\nURBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointer\nof the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 port\nstructure.\n\nFix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for\nmos7840.\n\nTested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.\n\n[ johan: analyse crash and rewrite commit message; set busy flag on\n         resume; drop bulk-in check; drop unnecessary usb_kill_urb() ](CVE-2024-42244)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket\n\nWhen using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This\ncauses xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing\nthe kernel to potentially freeze up.\n\nNeil suggested:\n\n  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready\n  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more\n  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.\n\nECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error\ncan be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels\nwhich do not have f10d05966196 (\"bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err\ninstead of allow boolean\"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for\nconsistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request().(CVE-2024-42246)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwireguard: allowedips: avoid unaligned 64-bit memory accesses\n\nOn the parisc platform, the kernel issues kernel warnings because\nswap_endian() tries to load a 128-bit IPv6 address from an unaligned\nmemory location:\n\n Kernel: unaligned access to 0x55f4688c in wg_allowedips_insert_v6+0x2c/0x80 [wireguard] (iir 0xf3010df)\n Kernel: unaligned access to 0x55f46884 in wg_allowedips_insert_v6+0x38/0x80 [wireguard] (iir 0xf2010dc)\n\nAvoid such unaligned memory accesses by instead using the\nget_unaligned_be64() helper macro.\n\n[Jason: replace src[8] in original patch with src+8](CVE-2024-42247)",

The client as\n\u003e a result indefinitely retries the request.\n\nThe Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all\nNFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a\nREAD.\n\nInstead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed\nand return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent\nthe client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to\nbe consistent with Solaris NFS servers.\n\nNote that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These\nmust be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit\ntype cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks\nagainst sb-\u003es_maxbytes do not work properly.",

But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a\n(\"drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal\") replaced the call to\nfence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and\nalso added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(\u0026fence-\u003eactive)) in front.\nNo justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of\nvma-\u003efence-\u003eactive without first waiting on it.\n\nThe issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence\nregisters on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked\non completion of a request that was using them on the other, still\nprocessed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by\nwaiting for idleness of vma-\u003efence-\u003eactive in i915_vma_revoke_fence().\n\n(cherry picked from commit 24bb052d3dd499c5956abad5f7d8e4fd07da7fb1)",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds\n\nFix UBSAN warnings that occur when using a system with 32 physical\ncpu cores or more, or when the user defines a number of Ethernet\nqueues greater than or equal to FP_SB_MAX_E1x using the num_queues\nmodule parameter.\n\nCurrently there is a read/write out of bounds that occurs on the array\n\"struct stats_query_entry query\" present inside the \"bnx2x_fw_stats_req\"\nstruct in \"drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h\".\nLooking at the definition of the \"struct stats_query_entry query\" array:\n\nstruct stats_query_entry query[FP_SB_MAX_E1x+\n         BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX];\n\nFP_SB_MAX_E1x is defined as the maximum number of fast path interrupts and\nhas a value of 16, while BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX has a value of 3\nmeaning the array has a total size of 19.\nSince accesses to \"struct stats_query_entry query\" are offset-ted by\nBNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX, that means that the total number of Ethernet\nqueues should not exceed FP_SB_MAX_E1x (16). However one of these queues\nis reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set\nto [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if\nit is not.\n\nThis is also described in a comment in the source code in\ndrivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition\nof FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important\nfor this patch\n\n/*\n  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is\n  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the\n  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default\n  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can\n  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such\n  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like\n  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues\n  *\n  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:\n  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of\n  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1\n  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)\n  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues\n  *    is Y+1\n  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for\n  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional\n  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).\n  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE\n  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.\n  */\n\nHowever this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can\nhandle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.\nLooking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally\nusing the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (\"bnx2x: Add 57712 support\").\nBack then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver\nwas later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be\nlimited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the\narray \"stats_query_entry query\" was still limited to using the FP-SB\navailable to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was\nupdated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being\naware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN\nwarnings seen in the stack traces below.\n\nThis patch increases the size of the \"stats_query_entry query\" array by\nreplacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle\nboth types of NICs.\n\nStack traces:\n\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in\n       drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_stats.c:1529:11\nindex 20 is out of range for type 'stats_query_entry [19]'\nCPU: 12 PID: 858 Comm: systemd-network Not tainted 6.9.0-060900rc7-generic\n\t     #202405052133\nHardware name: HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9/ProLiant DL360 \n---truncated---",

It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more\n  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.\n\nECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error\ncan be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels\nwhich do not have f10d05966196 (\"bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err\ninstead of allow boolean\"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for\nconsistent behavior.
