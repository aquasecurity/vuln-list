We need to issue a Set TR Dequeue Pointer for each, to ensure everything is reset properly and the caches cleared. Change the logic so that any N\u003e1 TDs found active for different streams are deferred until after the first one is processed, calling xhci_invalidate_cancelled_tds() again from xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() to queue another command until we are done with all of them. Also change the error/\"should never happen\" paths to ensure we at least clear any affected TDs, even if we can't issue a command to clear the hardware cache, and complain loudly with an xhci_warn() if this ever happens.  This problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 (\"USB: xhci: Correct assumptions about number of rings per endpoint.\") early on in the XHCI driver's life, when stream support was first added. It was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit 674f8438c121 (\"xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps\"), which added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materially changing the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic made the problem more obvious).  Then later, in commit 94f339147fc3 (\"xhci: Fix failure to give back some cached cancelled URBs.\"), it was acknowledged again.  [Mathias: commit 94f339147fc3 (\"xhci: Fix failure to give back some cached cancelled URBs.\") was a targeted regression fix to the previously mentioned patch. Users reported issues with usb stuck after unmounting/disconnecting UAS devices. This rolled back the TD clearing of multiple streams to its original state.]  Apparently the commit author was aware of the problem (yet still chose to submit it): It was still mentioned as a FIXME, an xhci_dbg() was added to log the problem condition, and the remaining issue was mentioned in the commit description. The choice of making the log type xhci_dbg() for what is, at this point, a completely unhandled and known broken condition is puzzling and unfortunate, as it guarantees that no actual users would see the log in production, thereby making it nigh undebuggable (indeed, even if you turn on DEBUG, the message doesn't really hint at there being a problem at all).  It took me *months* of random xHC crashes to finally find a reliable repro and be able to do a deep dive debug session, which could all have been avoided had this unhandled, broken condition been actually reported with a warning, as it should have been as a bug intentionally left in unfixed (never mind that it shouldn't have been left in at all).  \u003e Another fix to solve clearing the caches of all stream rings with \u003e cancelled TDs is needed, but not as urgent.  3 years after that statement and 14 years after the original bug was introduced, I think it's finally time to fix it. And maybe next time let's not leave bugs unfixed (that are actually worse than the original bug), and let's actually get people to review kernel commits please.  Fixes xHC crashes and IOMMU faults with UAS devices when handling errors/faults. Easiest repro is to use `hdparm` to mark an early sector (e.g. 1024) on a disk as bad, then `cat /dev/sdX \u003e /dev/null` in a loop. At least in the case of JMicron controllers, the read errors end up having to cancel two TDs (for two queued requests to different streams) and the one that didn't get cleared properly ends up faulting the xHC entirely when it tries to access DMA pages that have since been unmapped, referred to by the stale TDs. This normally happens quickly (after two or three loops). After this fix, I left the `cat` in a loop running overnight and experienced no xHC failures, with all read errors recovered properly. Repro'd and tested on an Apple M1 Mac Mini (dwc3 host).  On systems without an IOMMU, this bug would instead silently corrupt freed memory, making this a ---truncated---(CVE-2024-40927)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2830: fix an out-of-bounds write error  Ensure index in rtl2830_pid_filter does not exceed 31 to prevent out-of-bounds access.  dev-\u003efilters is a 32-bit value, so set_bit and clear_bit functions should only operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32, it will attempt to access a non-existent 33rd bit, leading to out-of-bounds access. Change the boundary check from index \u003e 32 to index \u003e= 32 to resolve this issue.(CVE-2024-47697)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211: use two-phase skb reclamation in ieee80211_do_stop()  Since '__dev_queue_xmit()' should be called with interrupts enabled, the following backtrace:  ieee80211_do_stop()  ...  spin_lock_irqsave(\u0026local-\u003equeue_stop_reason_lock, flags)  ...  ieee80211_free_txskb()   ieee80211_report_used_skb()    ieee80211_report_ack_skb()     cfg80211_mgmt_tx_status_ext()      nl80211_frame_tx_status()       genlmsg_multicast_netns()        genlmsg_multicast_netns_filtered()         nlmsg_multicast_filtered()   netlink_broadcast_filtered()    do_one_broadcast()     netlink_broadcast_deliver()      __netlink_sendskb()       netlink_deliver_tap()        __netlink_deliver_tap_skb()         dev_queue_xmit()          __dev_queue_xmit() ; with IRQS disabled  ...  spin_unlock_irqrestore(\u0026local-\u003equeue_stop_reason_lock, flags)  issues the warning (as reported by syzbot reproducer):  WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 5128 at kernel/softirq.c:362 __local_bh_enable_ip+0xc3/0x120  Fix this by implementing a two-phase skb reclamation in 'ieee80211_do_stop()', where actual work is performed outside of a section with interrupts disabled.(CVE-2024-47713)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211: don't use rate mask for offchannel TX either  Like the commit ab9177d83c04 (\"wifi: mac80211: don't use rate mask for scanning\"), ignore incorrect settings to avoid no supported rate warning reported by syzbot.  The syzbot did bisect and found cause is commit 9df66d5b9f45 (\"cfg80211: fix default HE tx bitrate mask in 2G band\"), which however corrects bitmask of HE MCS and recognizes correctly settings of empty legacy rate plus HE MCS rate instead of returning -EINVAL.  As suggestions [1], follow the change of SCAN TX to consider this case of offchannel TX as well.

This fixes 1 NULL_RETURNS issue reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-49897)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Pass non-null to dcn20_validate_apply_pipe_split_flags  [WHAT \u0026 HOW] \"dcn20_validate_apply_pipe_split_flags\" dereferences merge, and thus it cannot be a null pointer. Let's pass a valid pointer to avoid null dereference.  This fixes 2 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.(CVE-2024-49923)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs  The commit b8c43360f6e4 (\"net: stmmac: No need to calculate speed divider when offload is disabled\") allows the \"port_transmit_rate_kbps\" to be set to a value of 0, which is then passed to the \"div_s64\" function when tc-cbs is disabled. This leads to a zero-division error.  When tc-cbs is disabled, the idleslope, sendslope, and credit values the credit values are not required to be configured. Therefore, adding a return statement after setting the txQ mode to DCB when tc-cbs is disabled would prevent a zero-division error.(CVE-2024-49977)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdkfd: amdkfd_free_gtt_mem clear the correct pointer  Pass pointer reference to amdgpu_bo_unref to clear the correct pointer, otherwise amdgpu_bo_unref clear the local variable, the original pointer not set to NULL, this could cause use-after-free bug.(CVE-2024-49991)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet: lantiq_etop: fix memory disclosure  When applying padding, the buffer is not zeroed, which results in memory disclosure. The mentioned data is observed on the wire. This patch uses skb_put_padto() to pad Ethernet frames properly. The mentioned function zeroes the expanded buffer.  In case the packet cannot be padded it is silently dropped. Statistics are also not incremented. This driver does not support statistics in the old 32-bit format or the new 64-bit format. These will be added in the future. In its current form, the patch should be easily backported to stable versions.  Ethernet MACs on Amazon-SE and Danube cannot do padding of the packets in hardware, so software padding must be applied.(CVE-2024-49997)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: qcom: Fix NULL Dereference in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe()  A devm_kzalloc() in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe() could possibly return NULL pointer. NULL Pointer Dereference may be triggerred without addtional check. Add a NULL check for the returned pointer.(CVE-2024-50103)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/lam: Disable ADDRESS_MASKING in most cases  Linear Address Masking (LAM) has a weakness related to transient execution as described in the SLAM paper[1]. Unless Linear Address Space Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.  Until kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST, or when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time, otherwise keep LAM disabled.  There are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently nobody is affected by this issue.  [1] SLAM: https://download.vusec.net/papers/slam_sp24.pdf [2] LASS: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230609183632.48706-1-alexander.shishkin@linux.intel.com/  [ dhansen: update SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS -\u003e CPU_MITIGATIONS ](CVE-2024-50112)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag  Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.  This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix this.  This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine was expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer is written normally by log writing.(CVE-2024-50116)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method  If a BIOS provides bad data in response to an ATIF method call this causes a NULL pointer dereference in the caller.  ``` ? show_regs (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:478 (discriminator 1)) ? __die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:423 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:434) ? page_fault_oops (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:544 (discriminator 2) arch/x86/mm/fault.c:705 (discriminator 2)) ? do_user_addr_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:440 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1232 (discriminator 1)) ? acpi_ut_update_object_reference (drivers/acpi/acpica/utdelete.c:642) ? exc_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1542) ? asm_exc_page_fault (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:623) ? amdgpu_atif_query_backlight_caps.constprop.0 (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acpi.c:387 (discriminator 2)) amdgpu ? amdgpu_atif_query_backlight_caps.constprop.0 (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acpi.c:386 (discriminator 1)) amdgpu ```  It has been encountered on at least one system, so guard for it.  (cherry picked from commit c9b7c809b89f24e9372a4e7f02d64c950b07fdee)(CVE-2024-50117)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vboxvideo: Replace fake VLA at end of vbva_mouse_pointer_shape with real VLA  Replace the fake VLA at end of the vbva_mouse_pointer_shape shape with a real VLA to fix a \"memcpy: detected field-spanning write error\" warning:  [   13.319813] memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 16896) of single field \"p-\u003edata\" at drivers/gpu/drm/vboxvideo/hgsmi_base.c:154 (size 4) [   13.319841] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1105 at drivers/gpu/drm/vboxvideo/hgsmi_base.c:154 hgsmi_update_pointer_shape+0x192/0x1c0 [vboxvideo] [   13.320038] Call Trace: [   13.320173]  hgsmi_update_pointer_shape [vboxvideo] [   13.320184]  vbox_cursor_atomic_update [vboxvideo]  Note as mentioned in the added comment it seems the original length calculation for the allocated and send hgsmi buffer is 4 bytes too large. Changing this is not the goal of this patch, so this behavior is kept.(CVE-2024-50134)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: arm_scmi: Fix the double free in scmi_debugfs_common_setup()  Clang static checker(scan-build) throws below warning：   |  drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/driver.c:line 2915, column 2   |        Attempt to free released memory.

Remove the redundant scmi_debugfs_common_cleanup() to fix this problem.(CVE-2024-50159)\n\n(CVE-2024-50194)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  maple_tree: correct tree corruption on spanning store  Patch series \"maple_tree: correct tree corruption on spanning store\", v3.  There has been a nasty yet subtle maple tree corruption bug that appears to have been in existence since the inception of the algorithm.  This bug seems far more likely to happen since commit f8d112a4e657 (\"mm/mmap: avoid zeroing vma tree in mmap_region()\"), which is the point at which reports started to be submitted concerning this bug.  We were made definitely aware of the bug thanks to the kind efforts of Bert Karwatzki who helped enormously in my being able to track this down and identify the cause of it.  The bug arises when an attempt is made to perform a spanning store across two leaf nodes, where the right leaf node is the rightmost child of the shared parent, AND the store completely consumes the right-mode node.  This results in mas_wr_spanning_store() mitakenly duplicating the new and existing entries at the maximum pivot within the range, and thus maple tree corruption.  The fix patch corrects this by detecting this scenario and disallowing the mistaken duplicate copy.  The fix patch commit message goes into great detail as to how this occurs.  This series also includes a test which reliably reproduces the issue, and asserts that the fix works correctly.  Bert has kindly tested the fix and confirmed it resolved his issues.  Also Mikhail Gavrilov kindly reported what appears to be precisely the same bug, which this fix should also resolve.   This patch (of 2):  There has been a subtle bug present in the maple tree implementation from its inception.  This arises from how stores are performed - when a store occurs, it will overwrite overlapping ranges and adjust the tree as necessary to accommodate this.  A range may always ultimately span two leaf nodes.  In this instance we walk the two leaf nodes, determine which elements are not overwritten to the left and to the right of the start and end of the ranges respectively and then rebalance the tree to contain these entries and the newly inserted one.  This kind of store is dubbed a 'spanning store' and is implemented by mas_wr_spanning_store().  In order to reach this stage, mas_store_gfp() invokes mas_wr_preallocate(), mas_wr_store_type() and mas_wr_walk() in turn to walk the tree and update the object (mas) to traverse to the location where the write should be performed, determining its store type.  When a spanning store is required, this function returns false stopping at the parent node which contains the target range, and mas_wr_store_type() marks the mas-\u003estore_type as wr_spanning_store to denote this fact.  When we go to perform the store in mas_wr_spanning_store(), we first determine the elements AFTER the END of the range we wish to store (that is, to the right of the entry to be inserted) - we do this by walking to the NEXT pivot in the tree (i.e.  r_mas.last + 1), starting at the node we have just determined contains the range over which we intend to write.  We then turn our attention to the entries to the left of the entry we are inserting, whose state is represented by l_mas, and copy these into a 'big node', which is a special node which contains enough slots to contain two leaf node's worth of data.  We then copy the entry we wish to store immediately after this - the copy and the insertion of the new entry is performed by mas_store_b_node().  After this we copy the elements to the right of the end of the range which we are inserting, if we have not exceeded the length of the node (i.e.  r_mas.offset \u003c= r_mas.end).  Herein lies the bug - under very specific circumstances, this logic can break and corrupt the maple tree.  Consider the following tree:  Height   0                             Root Node                                  /      \\                  pivot = 0xffff /        \\ pivot = ULONG_MAX                                /           ---truncated---(CVE-2024-50200)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-clock: posix-clock: Fix unbalanced locking in pc_clock_settime()  If get_clock_desc() succeeds, it calls fget() for the clockid's fd, and get the clk-\u003erwsem read lock, so the error path should release the lock to make the lock balance and fput the clockid's fd to make the refcount balance and release the fd related resource.  However the below commit left the error path locked behind resulting in unbalanced locking. Check timespec64_valid_strict() before get_clock_desc() to fix it, because the \"ts\" is not changed after that.

The change in commit d24062914837 (\"fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicate maple tree in dup_mmap()\") makes this more pertinent as we may be in a state where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.  Their placement early in dup_mmap() only appears to have been meaningful for early error checking, and since functionally it'd require a very small allocation to fail (in practice 'too small to fail') that'd only occur in the most dire circumstances, meaning the fork would fail or be OOM'd in any case.  Since both khugepaged and KSM tracking are there to provide optimisations to memory performance rather than critical functionality, it doesn't really matter all that much if, under such dire memory pressure, we fail to register an mm with these.  As a result, we follow the example of commit d2081b2bf819 (\"mm: khugepaged: make khugepaged_enter() void function\") and make ksm_fork() a void function also.  We only expose the mm to these functions once we are done with them and only if no error occurred in the fork operation.(CVE-2024-50263)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  USB: serial: io_edgeport: fix use after free in debug printk  The \"dev_dbg(\u0026urb-\u003edev-\u003edev, ...\" which happens after usb_free_urb(urb) is a use after free of the \"urb\" pointer.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]): 1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the    pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'. 2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.  The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened: 1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the    slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta    and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to    descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,    and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a    keyring. 2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.    However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as    ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK. 3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT    has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits    NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that    all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a    shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points    to a shortcut.                        NODE A               +------\u003e+---+       ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6       +---+   |       +---+  xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6       +---+   |       +---+  xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6       +---+   |       +---+       | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6       +---+           +---+  xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6       +---+           +---+  xxe6 | f |       +---+  4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,    it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read    out-of-bounds read.  To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

This assumption is bogus since it's valid to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff: Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.  In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).

The following happens w/o this patch: - r0 is marked as not a subreg at (0); - w1 is marked as subreg at (2); - w1 subreg_def is overridden at (3) by copy_register_state(); - w1 is read at (5) but mark_insn_zext() does not mark (2)   for zero extension, because w1 subreg_def is not set; - because of BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag verifier inserts random   value for hi32 bits of (2) (marked (r)); - this random value is read at (5).(CVE-2024-53125)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_dirty_buffer tracepoint  When using the \"block:block_dirty_buffer\" tracepoint, mark_buffer_dirty() may cause a NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN is enabled.  This happens because, since the tracepoint was added in mark_buffer_dirty(), it references the dev_t member bh-\u003eb_bdev-\u003ebd_dev regardless of whether the buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current implementation, nilfs_grab_buffer(), which grabs a buffer to read (or create) a block of metadata, including b-tree node blocks, does not set the block device, but instead does so only if the buffer is not in the \"uptodate\" state for each of its caller block reading functions.  However, if the uptodate flag is set on a folio/page, and the buffer heads are detached from it by try_to_free_buffers(), and new buffer heads are then attached by create_empty_buffers(), the uptodate flag may be restored to each buffer without the block device being set to bh-\u003eb_bdev, and mark_buffer_dirty() may be called later in that state, resulting in the bug mentioned above.  Fix this issue by making nilfs_grab_buffer() always set the block device of the super block structure to the buffer head, regardless of the state of the buffer's uptodate flag.(CVE-2024-53130)",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-40927",
      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxhci: Handle TD clearing for multiple streams case\n\nWhen multiple streams are in use, multiple TDs might be in flight when\nan endpoint is stopped. We need to issue a Set TR Dequeue Pointer for\neach, to ensure everything is reset properly and the caches cleared.\nChange the logic so that any N\u003e1 TDs found active for different streams\nare deferred until after the first one is processed, calling\nxhci_invalidate_cancelled_tds() again from xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() to\nqueue another command until we are done with all of them. Also change\nthe error/\"should never happen\" paths to ensure we at least clear any\naffected TDs, even if we can't issue a command to clear the hardware\ncache, and complain loudly with an xhci_warn() if this ever happens.\n\nThis problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 (\"USB: xhci: Correct\nassumptions about number of rings per endpoint.\") early on in the XHCI\ndriver's life, when stream support was first added.\nIt was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit\n674f8438c121 (\"xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps\"),\nwhich added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materially\nchanging the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic made\nthe problem more obvious).\n\nThen later, in commit 94f339147fc3 (\"xhci: Fix failure to give back some\ncached cancelled URBs.\"), it was acknowledged again.\n\n[Mathias: commit 94f339147fc3 (\"xhci: Fix failure to give back some cached\ncancelled URBs.\") was a targeted regression fix to the previously mentioned\npatch. Users reported issues with usb stuck after unmounting/disconnecting\nUAS devices. This rolled back the TD clearing of multiple streams to its\noriginal state.]\n\nApparently the commit author was aware of the problem (yet still chose\nto submit it): It was still mentioned as a FIXME, an xhci_dbg() was\nadded to log the problem condition, and the remaining issue was mentioned\nin the commit description. The choice of making the log type xhci_dbg()\nfor what is, at this point, a completely unhandled and known broken\ncondition is puzzling and unfortunate, as it guarantees that no actual\nusers would see the log in production, thereby making it nigh\nundebuggable (indeed, even if you turn on DEBUG, the message doesn't\nreally hint at there being a problem at all).\n\nIt took me *months* of random xHC crashes to finally find a reliable\nrepro and be able to do a deep dive debug session, which could all have\nbeen avoided had this unhandled, broken condition been actually reported\nwith a warning, as it should have been as a bug intentionally left in\nunfixed (never mind that it shouldn't have been left in at all).\n\n\u003e Another fix to solve clearing the caches of all stream rings with\n\u003e cancelled TDs is needed, but not as urgent.\n\n3 years after that statement and 14 years after the original bug was\nintroduced, I think it's finally time to fix it. And maybe next time\nlet's not leave bugs unfixed (that are actually worse than the original\nbug), and let's actually get people to review kernel commits please.\n\nFixes xHC crashes and IOMMU faults with UAS devices when handling\nerrors/faults. Easiest repro is to use `hdparm` to mark an early sector\n(e.g. 1024) on a disk as bad, then `cat /dev/sdX \u003e /dev/null` in a loop.\nAt least in the case of JMicron controllers, the read errors end up\nhaving to cancel two TDs (for two queued requests to different streams)\nand the one that didn't get cleared properly ends up faulting the xHC\nentirely when it tries to access DMA pages that have since been unmapped,\nreferred to by the stale TDs. This normally happens quickly (after two\nor three loops). After this fix, I left the `cat` in a loop running\novernight and experienced no xHC failures, with all read errors\nrecovered properly. Repro'd and tested on an Apple M1 Mac Mini\n(dwc3 host).\n\nOn systems without an IOMMU, this bug would instead silently corrupt\nfreed memory, making this a\n---truncated---",

This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding.

In this instance we\nwalk the two leaf nodes, determine which elements are not overwritten to\nthe left and to the right of the start and end of the ranges respectively\nand then rebalance the tree to contain these entries and the newly\ninserted one.\n\nThis kind of store is dubbed a 'spanning store' and is implemented by\nmas_wr_spanning_store().\n\nIn order to reach this stage, mas_store_gfp() invokes\nmas_wr_preallocate(), mas_wr_store_type() and mas_wr_walk() in turn to\nwalk the tree and update the object (mas) to traverse to the location\nwhere the write should be performed, determining its store type.\n\nWhen a spanning store is required, this function returns false stopping at\nthe parent node which contains the target range, and mas_wr_store_type()\nmarks the mas-\u003estore_type as wr_spanning_store to denote this fact.\n\nWhen we go to perform the store in mas_wr_spanning_store(), we first\ndetermine the elements AFTER the END of the range we wish to store (that\nis, to the right of the entry to be inserted) - we do this by walking to\nthe NEXT pivot in the tree (i.e.  r_mas.last + 1), starting at the node we\nhave just determined contains the range over which we intend to write.\n\nWe then turn our attention to the entries to the left of the entry we are\ninserting, whose state is represented by l_mas, and copy these into a 'big\nnode', which is a special node which contains enough slots to contain two\nleaf node's worth of data.\n\nWe then copy the entry we wish to store immediately after this - the copy\nand the insertion of the new entry is performed by mas_store_b_node().\n\nAfter this we copy the elements to the right of the end of the range which\nwe are inserting, if we have not exceeded the length of the node (i.e. \nr_mas.offset \u003c= r_mas.end).\n\nHerein lies the bug - under very specific circumstances, this logic can\nbreak and corrupt the maple tree.\n\nConsider the following tree:\n\nHeight\n  0                             Root Node\n                                 /      \\\n                 pivot = 0xffff /        \\ pivot = ULONG_MAX\n                               /          \n---truncated---",

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------\u003e+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",
