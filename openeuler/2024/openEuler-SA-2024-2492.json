      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: support non-r10 register spill/fill to/from stack in precision tracking  Use instruction (jump) history to record instructions that performed register spill/fill to/from stack, regardless if this was done through read-only r10 register, or any other register after copying r10 into it *and* potentially adjusting offset.  To make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into instruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame number in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction history. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's checked most frequently during backtracking.  This change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of precision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known deficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of verified states, explored in the subsequent patches.  There are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files according to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).  File                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF) --------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  ------------- test_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%) xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%) xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)  Note, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to minimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between bpf and bpf-next trees.  Notice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of instruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of relying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we already have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we added jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but also we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we don't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is present.  Relying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one that was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.

This will decrement the local_addr_used\ncounter, which is wrong in this case because this counter is linked to\n'subflow' endpoints, and here it is a 'signal' endpoint that is being\nremoved.\n\nNow, the counter is decremented, only if the ID is being used outside\nof mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow(), only for 'subflow' endpoints, and\nif the ID is not 0 -- local_addr_used is not taking into account these\nones. This marking of the ID as being available, and the decrement is\ndone no matter if a subflow using this ID is currently available,\nbecause the subflow could have been closed before.(CVE-2024-45010)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvideo/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()\n\nIn aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(), we currently only\ncall sysfb_disable() on vga class devices.  This leads to the\nfollowing problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:\n\n1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display\n2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so\n   sysfb_disable() is not called, but the device resources\n   are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device()\n3. Non-primary GPU has a VGA class and it ends up calling sysfb_disable()\n4. NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources\n   have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when\n   it was called by the other device.\n\nFix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checking\nthe device to determine if we should execute it or not.\n\nv2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not set\nv3: Move device check into the mutex\n    Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()\n    Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled()(CVE-2024-46698)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/aux: Fix AUX buffer serialization\n\nOle reported that event-\u003emmap_mutex is strictly insufficient to\nserialize the AUX buffer, add a per RB mutex to fully serialize it.\n\nNote that in the lock order comment the perf_event::mmap_mutex order\nwas already wrong, that is, it nesting under mmap_lock is not new with\nthis patch.(CVE-2024-46713)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: protect XDP configuration with a mutex\n\nThe main threat to data consistency in ice_xdp() is a possible asynchronous\nPF reset.

The former one is not as\ntrivial, because between ice_vsi_close() and ice_vsi_rebuild(), a lot of\nhardware interaction happens, this can make adding/deleting rings exit\nwith an error.

This patch makes the following change :  1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.    But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)  2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.    This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.  3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.  This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.  As a bonus, I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path can use a lock-free operation.(CVE-2024-47678)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: avoid possible NULL deref in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev()  Blamed commit accidentally removed a check for rt-\u003ert6i_idev being NULL, as spotted by syzbot:  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 10998 Comm: syz-executor Not tainted 6.11.0-rc6-syzkaller-00208-g625403177711 #0 Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/06/2024  RIP: 0010:rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev net/ipv6/route.c:177 [inline]  RIP: 0010:rt6_disable_ip+0x33e/0x7e0 net/ipv6/route.c:4914 Code: 41 80 3c 04 00 74 0a e8 90 d0 9b f7 48 8b 7c 24 08 48 8b 07 48 89 44 24 10 4c 89 f0 48 c1 e8 03 48 b9 00 00 00 00 00 fc ff df \u003c80\u003e 3c 08 00 74 08 4c 89 f7 e8 64 d0 9b f7 48 8b 44 24 18 49 39 06 RSP: 0018:ffffc900047374e0 EFLAGS: 00010246 RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 1ffff1100fdf8f33 RCX: dffffc0000000000 RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000004 RDI: ffff88807efc78c0 RBP: ffffc900047375d0 R08: 0000000000000003 R09: fffff520008e6e8c R10: dffffc0000000000 R11: fffff520008e6e8c R12: 1ffff1100fdf8f18 R13: ffff88807efc7998 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff88807efc7930 FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b8900000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000020002a80 CR3: 0000000022f62000 CR4: 00000000003506f0 DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000 DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400 Call Trace:  \u003cTASK\u003e   addrconf_ifdown+0x15d/0x1bd0 net/ipv6/addrconf.c:3856  addrconf_notify+0x3cb/0x1020   notifier_call_chain+0x19f/0x3e0 kernel/notifier.c:93   call_netdevice_notifiers_extack net/core/dev.c:2032 [inline]   call_netdevice_notifiers net/core/dev.c:2046 [inline]   unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0xd81/0x1c40 net/core/dev.c:11352   unregister_netdevice_many net/core/dev.c:11414 [inline]   unregister_netdevice_queue+0x303/0x370 net/core/dev.c:11289   unregister_netdevice include/linux/netdevice.h:3129 [inline]   __tun_detach+0x6b9/0x1600 drivers/net/tun.c:685   tun_detach drivers/net/tun.c:701 [inline]   tun_chr_close+0x108/0x1b0 drivers/net/tun.c:3510   __fput+0x24a/0x8a0 fs/file_table.c:422   task_work_run+0x24f/0x310 kernel/task_work.c:228   exit_task_work include/linux/task_work.h:40 [inline]   do_exit+0xa2f/0x27f0 kernel/exit.c:882   do_group_exit+0x207/0x2c0 kernel/exit.c:1031   __do_sys_exit_group kernel/exit.c:1042 [inline]   __se_sys_exit_group kernel/exit.c:1040 [inline]   __x64_sys_exit_group+0x3f/0x40 kernel/exit.c:1040   x64_sys_call+0x2634/0x2640 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:232   do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]   do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f RIP: 0033:0x7f1acc77def9 Code: Unable to access opcode bytes at 0x7f1acc77decf.

According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.  This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.  To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable `ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param-\u003etsf_lo` field is then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is safely accessed.(CVE-2024-47712)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: call the security_mmap_file() LSM hook in remap_file_pages()  The remap_file_pages syscall handler calls do_mmap() directly, which doesn't contain the LSM security check. And if the process has called personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC) before and remap_file_pages() is called for RW pages, this will actually result in remapping the pages to RWX, bypassing a W^X policy enforced by SELinux.  So we should check prot by security_mmap_file LSM hook in the remap_file_pages syscall handler before do_mmap() is called. Otherwise, it potentially permits an attacker to bypass a W^X policy enforced by SELinux.  The bypass is similar to CVE-2016-10044, which bypass the same thing via AIO and can be found in [1].

The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                    CPU1                        |  ether3_ledoff ether3_remove         |   free_netdev(dev);   |   put_devic           |   kfree(dev);         |  |  ether3_outw(priv(dev)-\u003eregs.config2 |= CFG2_CTRLO, REG_CONFIG2);                       | // use dev  Fix it by ensuring that the timer is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in ether3_remove.(CVE-2024-47747)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/cxgb4: Added NULL check for lookup_atid  The lookup_atid() function can return NULL if the ATID is invalid or does not exist in the identifier table, which could lead to dereferencing a null pointer without a check in the `act_establish()` and `act_open_rpl()` functions. Add a NULL check to prevent null pointer dereferencing.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.(CVE-2024-47749)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node search  When the current node doesn't have an EPC section configured by firmware and all other EPC sections are used up, CPU can get stuck inside the while loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodes indefinitely, leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current will never be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not set in sgx_numa_mask.  Also worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware not to setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on each node can enhance performance, it is not a requirement for functionality.  Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. This avoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show up in the loop when it never will.(CVE-2024-49856)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm, slub: avoid zeroing kmalloc redzone  Since commit 946fa0dbf2d8 (\"mm/slub: extend redzone check to extra allocated kmalloc space than requested\"), setting orig_size treats the wasted space (object_size - orig_size) as a redzone. However with init_on_free=1 we clear the full object-\u003esize, including the redzone.  Additionally we clear the object metadata, including the stored orig_size, making it zero, which makes check_object() treat the whole object as a redzone.

Although all perfmons are destroyed in `v3d_perfmon_close_file()`, the active performance monitor's pointer (`v3d-\u003eactive_perfmon`) is still retained.  If `kmscube` is run again, the driver will attempt to stop the active performance monitor using the stale pointer in `v3d-\u003eactive_perfmon`. However, this pointer is no longer valid because the previous process has already terminated, and all performance monitors associated with it have been destroyed and freed.  To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a given process, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.(CVE-2024-50031)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: xtables: avoid NFPROTO_UNSPEC where needed  syzbot managed to call xt_cluster match via ebtables:   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at net/netfilter/xt_cluster.c:72 xt_cluster_mt+0x196/0x780  [..]  ebt_do_table+0x174b/0x2a40  Module registers to NFPROTO_UNSPEC, but it assumes ipv4/ipv6 packet processing.  As this is only useful to restrict locally terminating TCP/UDP traffic, register this for ipv4 and ipv6 family only.  Pablo points out that this is a general issue, direct users of the set/getsockopt interface can call into targets/matches that were only intended for use with ip(6)tables.  Check all UNSPEC matches and targets for similar issues:  - matches and targets are fine except if they assume skb_network_header()   is valid -- this is only true when called from inet layer: ip(6) stack   pulls the ip/ipv6 header into linear data area. - targets that return XT_CONTINUE or other xtables verdicts must be   restricted too, they are incompatbile with the ebtables traverser, e.g.   EBT_CONTINUE is a completely different value than XT_CONTINUE.  Most matches/targets are changed to register for NFPROTO_IPV4/IPV6, as they are provided for use by ip(6)tables.  The MARK target is also used by arptables, so register for NFPROTO_ARP too.  While at it, bail out if connbytes fails to enable the corresponding conntrack family.

This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.  It is dependent on: 1) the br_netfilter module being loaded; 2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1; 3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port; 4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded  When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata-\u003edst.dev is NULL.  Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call ip_skb_dst_mtu.  The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst with valid dst-\u003edev, thus the crash.  This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet instead.

SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LU's scsi_devices by UFS shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary. After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service, this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.      [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service     WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 4330 at drivers/firmware/efi/runtime-wrappers.c:341         __efi_queue_work+0x11c/0x170     Call trace:  Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM context.  If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.  However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation, it would result in a failure during error handling.  By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.  The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().    \"\"\"   We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to   trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req-\u003esk to the   bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null   before using it.   \"\"\"  The commit 83fccfc3940c (\"inet: fix potential deadlock in reqsk_queue_unlink()\") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a small race window.  Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true) to clear timer-\u003eentry.pprev and marks it as not pending.  If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers() calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.  The reported UAF could happen if req-\u003esk is close()d earlier than the timer expiration, which is 63s by default.  The scenario would be    1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),      but del_timer_sync() is missed    2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again    3. req-\u003esk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but      reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not      clear req-\u003esk for non-TFO sockets    4. sk is close()d    5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req-\u003esk  Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to __inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().  Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most use cases.

This can cause soft lockup on one of the processors, if the rate of DB is very high.  Add a loop count for FPGA and exit the __wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_th if the loop is taking more time. Pacing will be continuing until the occupancy is below the threshold.

This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g.  SEC(\"xdp\") int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt) {         return bpf_redirect_map(\u0026dev_redirect_map, 0, 0); }  SEC(\"xdp/devmap\") int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt) {         bpf_printk(\"ifindex %i\", pkt-\u003eingress_ifindex);         return XDP_PASS; }  depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced:  \u003c1\u003e[  574.475170] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000 \u003c1\u003e[  574.475188] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode \u003c1\u003e[  574.475194] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page \u003c6\u003e[  574.475199] PGD 0 P4D 0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475207] Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI \u003c4\u003e[  574.475217] CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 217 Comm: kworker/4:1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc5-reduced-00859-g780801200300 #23 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475226] Hardware name: Intel(R) Client Systems NUC13ANHi7/NUC13ANBi7, BIOS ANRPL357.0026.2023.0314.1458 03/14/2023 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475231] Workqueue: mld mld_ifc_work \u003c4\u003e[  574.475247] RIP: 0010:bpf_prog_5e13354d9cf5018a_prog_after_redirect+0x17/0x3c \u003c4\u003e[  574.475257] Code: cc cc cc cc cc cc cc 80 00 00 00 cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc f3 0f 1e fa 0f 1f 44 00 00 66 90 55 48 89 e5 f3 0f 1e fa 48 8b 57 20 \u003c48\u003e 8b 52 00 8b 92 e0 00 00 00 48 bf f8 a6 d5 c4 5d a0 ff ff be 0b \u003c4\u003e[  574.475263] RSP: 0018:ffffa62440280c98 EFLAGS: 00010206 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475269] RAX: ffffa62440280cd8 RBX: 0000000000000001 RCX: 0000000000000000 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475274] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffa62440549048 RDI: ffffa62440280ce0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475278] RBP: ffffa62440280c98 R08: 0000000000000002 R09: 0000000000000001 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475281] R10: ffffa05dc8b98000 R11: ffffa05f577fca40 R12: ffffa05dcab24000 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475285] R13: ffffa62440280ce0 R14: ffffa62440549048 R15: ffffa62440549000 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475289] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffffa05f4f700000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475294] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475298] CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 000000025522e000 CR4: 0000000000f50ef0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475303] PKRU: 55555554 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475306] Call Trace: \u003c4\u003e[  574.475313]  \u003cIRQ\u003e \u003c4\u003e[  574.475318]  ? __die+0x23/0x70 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475329]  ? page_fault_oops+0x180/0x4c0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475339]  ? skb_pp_cow_data+0x34c/0x490 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475346]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x257/0x280 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475357]  ? exc_page_fault+0x67/0x150 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475368]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475381]  ? bpf_prog_5e13354d9cf5018a_prog_after_redirect+0x17/0x3c \u003c4\u003e[  574.475386]  bq_xmit_all+0x158/0x420 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475397]  __dev_flush+0x30/0x90 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475407]  veth_poll+0x216/0x250 [veth] \u003c4\u003e[  574.475421]  __napi_poll+0x28/0x1c0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475430]  net_rx_action+0x32d/0x3a0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475441]  handle_softirqs+0xcb/0x2c0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475451]  do_softirq+0x40/0x60 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475458]  \u003c/IRQ\u003e \u003c4\u003e[  574.475461]  \u003cTASK\u003e \u003c4\u003e[  574.475464]  __local_bh_enable_ip+0x66/0x70 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475471]  __dev_queue_xmit+0x268/0xe40 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475480]  ? selinux_ip_postroute+0x213/0x420 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475491]  ? alloc_skb_with_frags+0x4a/0x1d0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475502]  ip6_finish_output2+0x2be/0x640 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475512]  ? nf_hook_slow+0x42/0xf0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475521]  ip6_finish_output+0x194/0x300 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475529]  ? __pfx_ip6_finish_output+0x10/0x10 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475538]  mld_sendpack+0x17c/0x240 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475548]  mld_ifc_work+0x192/0x410 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475557]  process_one_work+0x15d/0x380 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475566]  worker_thread+0x29d/0x3a0 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475573]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475580]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475587]  kthread+0xcd/0x100 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475597]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475606]  ret_from_fork+0x31/0x50 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475615]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10 \u003c4\u003e[  574.475623]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x ---truncated---(CVE-2024-50162)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsl/fman: Fix refcount handling of fman-related devices  In mac_probe() there are multiple calls to of_find_device_by_node(), fman_bind() and fman_port_bind() which takes references to of_dev-\u003edev. Not all references taken by these calls are released later on error path in mac_probe() and in mac_remove() which lead to reference leaks.  Add references release.(CVE-2024-50166)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock: Update rx_bytes on read_skb()  Make sure virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt() and virtio_transport_dec_rx_pkt() calls are balanced (i.e. virtio_vsock_sock::rx_bytes doesn't lie) after vsock_transport::read_skb().  While here, also inform the peer that we've freed up space and it has more credit.  Failing to update rx_bytes after packet is dequeued leads to a warning on SOCK_STREAM recv():  [  233.396654] rx_queue is empty, but rx_bytes is non-zero [  233.396702] WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 40601 at net/vmw_vsock/virtio_transport_common.c:589(CVE-2024-50169)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: bcmasp: fix potential memory leak in bcmasp_xmit()  The bcmasp_xmit() returns NETDEV_TX_OK without freeing skb in case of mapping fails, add dev_kfree_skb() to fix it.(CVE-2024-50170)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: systemport: fix potential memory leak in bcm_sysport_xmit()  The bcm_sysport_xmit() returns NETDEV_TX_OK without freeing skb in case of dma_map_single() fails, add dev_kfree_skb() to fix it.(CVE-2024-50171)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map  Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).  More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(), set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success (0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly \"work\" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages), but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the direct map.  Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be affected.  From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the intended behavior [1] (preferred over having set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

We knew this misses proper locking (sb-\u003es_umount) and does not go through proper filesystem remount procedure but it has been the way this worked since early ext2 days and it was good enough for catastrophic situation damage mitigation. Recently, syzbot has found a way (see link) to trigger warnings in filesystem freezing because the code got confused by SB_RDONLY changing under its hands. Since these days we set EXT4_FLAGS_SHUTDOWN on the superblock which is enough to stop all filesystem modifications, modifying SB_RDONLY shouldn't be needed. So stop doing that.(CVE-2024-50191)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v4: Don't allow a VMOVP on a dying VPE  Kunkun Jiang reported that there is a small window of opportunity for userspace to force a change of affinity for a VPE while the VPE has already been unmapped, but the corresponding doorbell interrupt still visible in /proc/irq/.  Plug the race by checking the value of vmapp_count, which tracks whether the VPE is mapped ot not, and returning an error in this case.  This involves making vmapp_count common to both GICv4.1 and its v4.0 ancestor.(CVE-2024-50192)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  posix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()  As Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core checked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling ptp-\u003einfo-\u003esettime64().  As the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or tp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL, which include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is consistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid() only check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is in a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict() in pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.  There are some drivers that use tp-\u003etv_sec and tp-\u003etv_nsec directly to write registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer has checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as hclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(), and some drivers can remove the checks of itself.(CVE-2024-50195)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf, arm64: Fix address emission with tag-based KASAN enabled  When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is enabled, the address of a bpf_tramp_image struct on the stack is passed during the size calculation pass and an address on the heap is passed during code generation. This may cause a heap buffer overflow if the heap address is tagged because emit_a64_mov_i64() will emit longer code than it did during the size calculation pass. The same problem could occur without tag-based KASAN if one of the 16-bit words of the stack address happened to be all-ones during the size calculation pass. Fix the problem by assuming the worst case (4 instructions) when calculating the size of the bpf_tramp_image address emission.(CVE-2024-50203)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: firewire-lib: Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size()  The step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop, but if it's not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable check before the division.  The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b (\"ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size\"), and it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters will satisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from the amdtp_rate_table[] table.

There will be a single PDE page address (contiguous pages in the case of \u003e PAGE_SIZE), but, current logic assumes multiple pages, leading to invalid memory access after 256K PBL entries in the PDE.(CVE-2024-50208)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re: Add a check for memory allocation  __alloc_pbl() can return error when memory allocation fails.

But the loop for that uses args-\u003epag as loop iterator while the later code expects pag to be set.  Fix this by reusing the max_pag case for this last resort, and also add a check for impossible case of no AG just to make sure that the uninitialized pag doesn't even escape in theory.(CVE-2024-50216)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix use-after-free of block device file in __btrfs_free_extra_devids()  Mounting btrfs from two images (which have the same one fsid and two different dev_uuids) in certain executing order may trigger an UAF for variable 'device-\u003ebdev_file' in __btrfs_free_extra_devids().

Normally this program will not cause kernel crashes. But before the munmap system call returns to user mode, a potential task_numa_work() for numa balancing could be added and executed. In this scenario, since the child process has no vma after munmap, the vma_next() in task_numa_work() will return a null pointer even if the vma iterator restarts from 0.  Recheck the vma pointer before dereferencing it in task_numa_work().(CVE-2024-50223)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag  Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only, __block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size, triggering a kernel bug.  This was found to be because the \"checked\" flag of a page/folio was not cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.  This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was applied to more than just metadata files.(CVE-2024-50230)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device  iwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason seems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before interrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually the whole thing blows up.  Fix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before interrupts get enabled during resume.

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo.  This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes, as we observed with java applications.  Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively restores the old behavior.(CVE-2024-50271)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filemap: Fix bounds checking in filemap_read()  If the caller supplies an iocb-\u003eki_pos value that is close to the filesystem upper limit, and an iterator with a count that causes us to overflow that limit, then filemap_read() enters an infinite loop.  This behaviour was discovered when testing xfstests generic/525 with the \"localio\" optimisation for loopback NFS mounts.(CVE-2024-50272)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list  At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.  If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences otherwise.  So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.(CVE-2024-50273)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps  The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while TIF_SVE is set:  |         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE)) |                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */  Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/   https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/  The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on the same CPU, e.g.  | void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs) | { |         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled |         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is 0. |         // per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task. | |         ... | |         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1. |         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set. | |         get_cpu_fpsimd_context(); | |         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE)) |                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */ | |         sve_init_regs() { |                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) { |                         ... |                 } else { |                         fpsimd_to_sve(current); |                         current-\u003ethread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE; |                 } |         } | |         put_cpu_fpsimd_context(); | |         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0. |         // task-\u003efpsimd_cpu is still 0 |         // If per_cpu_ptr(\u0026fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then: |         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled) |         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared |         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore | }  Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.(CVE-2024-50275)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: vertexcom: mse102x: Fix possible double free of TX skb  The scope of the TX skb is wider than just mse102x_tx_frame_spi(), so in case the TX skb room needs to be expanded, we should free the the temporary skb instead of the original skb.

It will avoid freeing session before calling smb3_preauth_hash_rsp().(CVE-2024-50283)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ksmbd: Fix the missing xa_store error check  xa_store() can fail, it return xa_err(-EINVAL) if the entry cannot be stored in an XArray, or xa_err(-ENOMEM) if memory allocation failed, so check error for xa_store() to fix it.(CVE-2024-50284)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: av7110: fix a spectre vulnerability  As warned by smatch:  drivers/staging/media/av7110/av7110_ca.c:270 dvb_ca_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'av7110-\u003eci_slot' [w] (local cap)  There is a spectre-related vulnerability at the code. Fix it.(CVE-2024-50289)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls  If a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between it being queued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort will be prioritised over the connection and it will be removed from local-\u003enew_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() without a lock being held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race occurs.  Fix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever list its -\u003ewait_link happens to be on.(CVE-2024-50294)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: enetc: allocate vf_state during PF probes  In the previous implementation, vf_state is allocated memory only when VF is enabled. However, net_device_ops::ndo_set_vf_mac() may be called before VF is enabled to configure the MAC address of VF. If this is the case, enetc_pf_set_vf_mac() will access vf_state, resulting in access to a null pointer.

The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing, excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point. This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write. This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with the write blocked starting a new write:  task:fio             state:D stack:0     pid:886   tgid:886   ppid:876 Call trace:  __switch_to+0x1d8/0x348  __schedule+0x8e8/0x2248  schedule+0x110/0x3f0  percpu_rwsem_wait+0x1e8/0x3f8  __percpu_down_read+0xe8/0x500  io_write+0xbb8/0xff8  io_issue_sqe+0x10c/0x1020  io_submit_sqes+0x614/0x2110  __arm64_sys_io_uring_enter+0x524/0x1038  invoke_syscall+0x74/0x268  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x160/0x238  do_el0_svc+0x44/0x60  el0_svc+0x44/0xb0  el0t_64_sync_handler+0x118/0x128  el0t_64_sync+0x168/0x170 INFO: task fsfreeze:7364 blocked for more than 15 seconds.

For normal issue where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.  Since freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isn't something that can be triggered by a regular user.(CVE-2024-53052)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix 6 GHz scan construction  If more than 255 colocated APs exist for the set of all APs found during 2.4/5 GHz scanning, then the 6 GHz scan construction will loop forever since the loop variable has type u8, which can never reach the number found when that's bigger than 255, and is stored in a u32 variable. Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope.  Using a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs in the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan results, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11, we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well in the bounds of a u32.(CVE-2024-53055)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: s5p-jpeg: prevent buffer overflows  The current logic allows word to be less than 2. If this happens, there will be buffer overflows, as reported by smatch. Add extra checks to prevent it.  While here, remove an unused word = 0 assignment.(CVE-2024-53061)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access  The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.  The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.  On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption that the register functions already did the needed checks.  This can be fragile if some device ends using different calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers like Coverity.  So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.(CVE-2024-53063)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs: Fix KMSAN warning in decode_getfattr_attrs()  Fix the following KMSAN warning:  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 7651 Comm: cp Tainted: G    B Tainted: [B]=BAD_PAGE Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009) ===================================================== ===================================================== BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in decode_getfattr_attrs+0x2d6d/0x2f90  decode_getfattr_attrs+0x2d6d/0x2f90  decode_getfattr_generic+0x806/0xb00  nfs4_xdr_dec_getattr+0x1de/0x240  rpcauth_unwrap_resp_decode+0xab/0x100  rpcauth_unwrap_resp+0x95/0xc0  call_decode+0x4ff/0xb50  __rpc_execute+0x57b/0x19d0  rpc_execute+0x368/0x5e0  rpc_run_task+0xcfe/0xee0  nfs4_proc_getattr+0x5b5/0x990  __nfs_revalidate_inode+0x477/0xd00  nfs_access_get_cached+0x1021/0x1cc0  nfs_do_access+0x9f/0xae0  nfs_permission+0x1e4/0x8c0  inode_permission+0x356/0x6c0  link_path_walk+0x958/0x1330  path_lookupat+0xce/0x6b0  filename_lookup+0x23e/0x770  vfs_statx+0xe7/0x970  vfs_fstatat+0x1f2/0x2c0  __se_sys_newfstatat+0x67/0x880  __x64_sys_newfstatat+0xbd/0x120  x64_sys_call+0x1826/0x3cf0  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x1b0  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f  The KMSAN warning is triggered in decode_getfattr_attrs(), when calling decode_attr_mdsthreshold(). It appears that fattr-\u003emdsthreshold is not initialized.  Fix the issue by initializing fattr-\u003emdsthreshold to NULL in nfs_fattr_init().(CVE-2024-53066)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks for the error path of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()  If per_time_scales[i] or per_time_gains[i] kcalloc fails in the for loop of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table(), the err_free_out will fail to call kfree() each time when i is reduced to 0, so all the per_time_scales[0] and per_time_gains[0] will not be freed, which will cause memory leaks.  Fix it by checking if i \u003e= 0.(CVE-2024-53076)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: qcom-pmic: init value of hdr_len/txbuf_len earlier  If the read of USB_PDPHY_RX_ACKNOWLEDGE_REG failed, then hdr_len and txbuf_len are uninitialized. This commit stops to print uninitialized value and misleading/false data.(CVE-2024-53083)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first  Setting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy according, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while the operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of this behaviour.  Aadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip-\u003eflags both in tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED check inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when the lock is reserved.(CVE-2024-53085)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  LoongArch: KVM: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context  Like commit 2c0d278f3293f (\"KVM: LAPIC: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context\") and commit 9090825fa9974 (\"KVM: arm/arm64: Let the timer expire in hardirq context on RT\"), On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels unmarked hrtimers are moved into soft interrupt expiry mode by default. Then the timers are canceled from an preempt-notifier which is invoked with disabled preemption which is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT.  The timer callback is short so in could be invoked in hard-IRQ context. So let the timer expire on hard-IRQ context even on -RT.  This fix a \"scheduling while atomic\" bug for PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels:   BUG: scheduling while atomic: qemu-system-loo/1011/0x00000002  Modules linked in: amdgpu rfkill nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6 nft_fib nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject nft_ct nft_chain_nat ns  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 1011 Comm: qemu-system-loo Tainted: G        W          6.12.0-rc2+ #1774  Tainted: [W]=WARN  Hardware name: Loongson Loongson-3A5000-7A1000-1w-CRB/Loongson-LS3A5000-7A1000-1w-CRB, BIOS vUDK2018-LoongArch-V2.0.0-prebeta9 10/21/2022  Stack : ffffffffffffffff 0000000000000000 9000000004e3ea38 9000000116744000          90000001167475a0 0000000000000000 90000001167475a8 9000000005644830          90000000058dc000 90000000058dbff8 9000000116747420 0000000000000001          0000000000000001 6a613fc938313980 000000000790c000 90000001001c1140          00000000000003fe 0000000000000001 000000000000000d 0000000000000003          0000000000000030 00000000000003f3 000000000790c000 9000000116747830          90000000057ef000 0000000000000000 9000000005644830 0000000000000004          0000000000000000 90000000057f4b58 0000000000000001 9000000116747868          900000000451b600 9000000005644830 9000000003a13998 0000000010000020          00000000000000b0 0000000000000004 0000000000000000 0000000000071c1d          ...

We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's\nchecked most frequently during backtracking.\n\nThis change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of\nprecision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known\ndeficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of\nverified states, explored in the subsequent patches.\n\nThere are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files\naccording to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).\n\nFile                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)\n--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------\ntest_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)\n\nNote, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to\nminimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between\nbpf and bpf-next trees.\n\nNotice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of\ninstruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of\nrelying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we\nalready have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we\nadded jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but\nalso we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we\ndon't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is\npresent.\n\nRelying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one\nthat was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.\n\n  [0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20231110002638.4168352-3-andrii@kernel.org/",

The tunnel_dst is a metadata type\nof dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata-\u003edst.dev is NULL.\n\nThen in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check\nfor frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the\nVxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call\nip_skb_dst_mtu.\n\nThe ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst\nwith valid dst-\u003edev, thus the crash.\n\nThis case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet\ninstead.\n\nPING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) from 0.0.0.0 h1-eth0: 2000(2028) bytes of data.\n[  176.291791] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000110\n[  176.292101] Mem abort info:\n[  176.292184]   ESR = 0x0000000096000004\n[  176.292322]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  176.292530]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  176.292709]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  176.292862]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n[  176.293013] Data abort info:\n[  176.293104]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  176.293488]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  176.293787]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  176.293995] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000043ef5000\n[  176.294166] [0000000000000110] pgd=0000000000000000,\np4d=0000000000000000\n[  176.294827] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  176.295252] Modules linked in: vxlan ip6_udp_tunnel udp_tunnel veth\nbr_netfilter bridge stp llc ipv6 crct10dif_ce\n[  176.295923] CPU: 0 PID: 188 Comm: ping Not tainted\n6.8.0-rc3-g5b3fbd61b9d1 #2\n[  176.296314] Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n[  176.296535] pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS\nBTYPE=--)\n[  176.296808] pc : br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x390/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.297382] lr : br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x2ac/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.297636] sp : ffff800080003630\n[  176.297743] x29: ffff800080003630 x28: 0000000000000008 x27:\nffff6828c49ad9f8\n[  176.298093] x26: ffff6828c49ad000 x25: 0000000000000000 x24:\n00000000000003e8\n[  176.298430] x23: 0000000000000000 x22: ffff6828c4960b40 x21:\nffff6828c3b16d28\n[  176.298652] x20: ffff6828c3167048 x19: ffff6828c3b16d00 x18:\n0000000000000014\n[  176.298926] x17: ffffb0476322f000 x16: ffffb7e164023730 x15:\n0000000095744632\n[  176.299296] x14: ffff6828c3f1c880 x13: 0000000000000002 x12:\nffffb7e137926a70\n[  176.299574] x11: 0000000000000001 x10: ffff6828c3f1c898 x9 :\n0000000000000000\n[  176.300049] x8 : ffff6828c49bf070 x7 : 0008460f18d5f20e x6 :\nf20e0100bebafeca\n[  176.300302] x5 : ffff6828c7f918fe x4 : ffff6828c49bf070 x3 :\n0000000000000000\n[  176.300586] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : ffff6828c3c7ad00 x0 :\nffff6828c7f918f0\n[  176.300889] Call trace:\n[  176.301123]  br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x390/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.301411]  br_nf_post_routing+0x2a8/0x3e4 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.301703]  nf_hook_slow+0x48/0x124\n[  176.302060]  br_forward_finish+0xc8/0xe8 [bridge]\n[  176.302371]  br_nf_hook_thresh+0x124/0x134 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.302605]  br_nf_forward_finish+0x118/0x22c [br_netfilter]\n[  176.302824]  br_nf_forward_ip.part.0+0x264/0x290 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.303136]  br_nf_forward+0x2b8/0x4e0 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.303359]  nf_hook_slow+0x48/0x124\n[  176.303\n---truncated---",

This\nis the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k\nPTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is\nset up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make\nsemantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).\n\nMore precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success\n(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly\n\"work\" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),\nbut it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the\ndirect map.\n\nNote that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems\nwhere can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with\nCONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and\nCONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent\nfailure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most\narm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be\naffected.\n\nFrom going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch\nseries, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the\nintended behavior [1] (preferred over having\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in\nSIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between\nv16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201124164930.GK8537@kernel.org/\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210121122723.3446-11-rppt@kernel.org/#t\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201125092208.12544-10-rppt@kernel.org/",

However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if\noverride_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  \n\nFor example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV\nsignal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the\nsignal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. \nThis prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and\nhandling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are\nunaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is\neffectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and\ncrashes, as we observed with java applications.\n\nFix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip\nthe comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.

This results in an\ninvalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison\npointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and\nCONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences\notherwise.\n\nSo fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",
