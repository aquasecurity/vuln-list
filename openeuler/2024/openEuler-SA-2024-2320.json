To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84.(CVE-2020-26979)\n\nOne phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example 'https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com'. To mitigate this type of attack, Firefox will display a warning dialog; however, this warning dialog would not have been displayed if evil.com used a redirect that was cached by the browser.
