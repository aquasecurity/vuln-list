The django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend.authenticate() method allows remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack involving login requests for users with an unusable password.(CVE-2024-39329)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class, when they override generate_filename() without replicating the file-path validations from the parent class, potentially allow directory traversal via certain inputs during a save() call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)(CVE-2024-39330)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. get_supported_language_variant() was subject to a potential denial-of-service attack when used with very long strings containing specific characters.(CVE-2024-39614)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The floatformat template filter is subject to significant memory consumption when given a string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent.(CVE-2024-41989)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The urlize() and urlizetrunc() template filters are subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via very large inputs with a specific sequence of characters.(CVE-2024-41990)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. The urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, and the AdminURLFieldWidget widget, are subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of Unicode characters.(CVE-2024-41991)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.8 and 4.2 before 4.2.15. QuerySet.values() and values_list() methods on models with a JSONField are subject to SQL injection in column aliases via a crafted JSON object key as a passed *arg.(CVE-2024-42005)",
