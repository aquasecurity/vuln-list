It is a complex issue.\n\nT1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears 'mddev-\u003eflush_bio'\n    and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended\n    by T4.\nT2. the second flush sets 'mddev-\u003eflush_bio', and attempts to queue\n    md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and won't\n    execute again if on the same CPU as T1.\nT3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blocked because\n    'mddev-\u003eflush_bio' is not NULL (set by T2).\nT4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc\n    by T3.\n\n  T1\t\tT2\t\tT3\t\tT4\n  (flush 1)\t(flush 2)\t(third 3)\t(suspend)\n  md_submit_flush_data\n   mddev-\u003eflush_bio = NULL;\n   .\n   .\t \tmd_flush_request\n   .\t  \t mddev-\u003eflush_bio = bio\n   .\t  \t queue submit_flushes\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t .\t\tmd_handle_request\n   .\t\t .\t\t active_io + 1\n   .\t\t .\t\t md_flush_request\n   .\t\t .\t\t  wait !mddev-\u003eflush_bio\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t .\t\t\t\tmddev_suspend\n   .\t\t .\t\t\t\t wait !active_io\n   .\t\t .\n   .\t\t submit_flushes\n   .\t\t queue_work md_submit_flush_data\n   .\t\t //md_submit_flush_data is already running (T1)\n   .\n   md_handle_request\n    wait resume\n\nThe root issue is non-atomic inc/dec of active_io during flush process.\nactive_io is dec before md_submit_flush_data is queued, and inc soon\nafter md_submit_flush_data() run.\n  md_flush_request\n    active_io + 1\n    submit_flushes\n      active_io - 1\n      md_submit_flush_data\n        md_handle_request\n        active_io + 1\n          make_request\n        active_io - 1\n\nIf active_io is dec after md_handle_request() instead of within\nsubmit_flushes(), make_request() can be called directly intead of\nmd_handle_request() in md_submit_flush_data(), and active_io will\nonly inc and dec once in the whole flush process.

Since dm always splits data and flush operation into two\nseparate io, io size of flush submitted by dm always is 0, make_request()\nwill not be called in md_submit_flush_data(). To prevent future\nmodifications from introducing issues, add WARN_ON to ensure\nmake_request() no error is returned in this context.(CVE-2024-43855)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmemcg: protect concurrent access to mem_cgroup_idr\n\nCommit 73f576c04b94 (\"mm: memcontrol: fix cgroup creation failure after\nmany small jobs\") decoupled the memcg IDs from the CSS ID space to fix the\ncgroup creation failures.  It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg ID\nspace.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms for\nmodifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()\nhappen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutex\nfrom concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idr\nwas not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently for\ndifferent memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.\n\nWe have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency in\nour fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part of\nlist_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparenting\ncode.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentry\nand inode), the super_block's list_lru didn't have list_lru_one for the\nmemcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object is\nnot allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehow\nmemcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg but\nreturned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.\n\nLooking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg's id\nis not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgs\nhave same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the most\nreasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to race\nbetween multiple idr_remove() calls or race between\nidr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causing\nmultiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of them\nwould cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access from\nother memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one.(CVE-2024-43892)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: core: check uartclk for zero to avoid divide by zero\n\nCalling ioctl TIOCSSERIAL with an invalid baud_base can\nresult in uartclk being zero, which will result in a\ndivide by zero error in uart_get_divisor().

The count of active\nbulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.\n\nThis has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a\nhash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of\nthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,\nand if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host\nstate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the\nhost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is\nassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host\nanymore, are incremented again).\n\nBack when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always\nenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration\nflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but\nthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious\ndecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).\n\nAFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around\nhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in\nitself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this\nis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is\nenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first\nbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this\nmode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the\nqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the\narray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and\nused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,\nwhich is quite impressive in its own right.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on\ndecrement as is used on increment.\n\nThe original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed\nin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply\nbefore that.(CVE-2024-46828)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete\n\nIn reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could be unkind since we aren't\nholding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transient\nincorrect answer.  In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), which\ncould happen if we have extent tree corruption.  Change that to return\n-EUCLEAN.  In do_walk_down() we catch this case and handle it correctly,\nhowever we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate error code.\nFinally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convert\nthat to proper error handling.  Also adjust the error message so we can\nactually do something with the information.(CVE-2024-46840)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel: Limit the period on Haswell\n\nRunning the ltp test cve-2015-3290 concurrently reports the following\nwarnings.\n\nperfevents: irq loop stuck!\n  WARNING: CPU: 31 PID: 32438 at arch/x86/events/intel/core.c:3174\n  intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cNMI\u003e\n   ? __warn+0xa4/0x220\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? __report_bug+0x123/0x130\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? __report_bug+0x123/0x130\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? report_bug+0x3e/0xa0\n   ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x50\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n   ? irq_work_claim+0x1e/0x40\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   perf_event_nmi_handler+0x3d/0x60\n   nmi_handle+0x104/0x330\n\nThanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low\ninitial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers\nthe defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the\ndetails, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)\n\nThe HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL\nevent, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the\nsame as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum\nperiod of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.\n\nHSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the\nHyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware\nhas more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message\n'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed\nwith a period \u003c 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum\nperiod of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.\nThe recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.\nBecause it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings\nextra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue\nhas been reported so far.(CVE-2024-46848)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dpaa: Pad packets to ETH_ZLEN\n\nWhen sending packets under 60 bytes, up to three bytes of the buffer\nfollowing the data may be leaked. Avoid this by extending all packets to\nETH_ZLEN, ensuring nothing is leaked in the padding. This bug can be\nreproduced by running\n\n\t$ ping -s 11 destination(CVE-2024-46854)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_socket: fix sk refcount leaks\n\nWe must put 'sk' reference before returning.(CVE-2024-46855)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: pm: Fix uaf in __timer_delete_sync\n\nThere are two paths to access mptcp_pm_del_add_timer, result in a race\ncondition:\n\n     CPU1\t\t\t\tCPU2\n     ====                               ====\n     net_rx_action\n     napi_poll                          netlink_sendmsg\n     __napi_poll                        netlink_unicast\n     process_backlog                    netlink_unicast_kernel\n     __netif_receive_skb                genl_rcv\n     __netif_receive_skb_one_core       netlink_rcv_skb\n     NF_HOOK                            genl_rcv_msg\n     ip_local_deliver_finish            genl_family_rcv_msg\n     ip_protocol_deliver_rcu            genl_family_rcv_msg_doit\n     tcp_v4_rcv                         mptcp_pm_nl_flush_addrs_doit\n     tcp_v4_do_rcv                      mptcp_nl_remove_addrs_list\n     tcp_rcv_established                mptcp_pm_remove_addrs_and_subflows\n     tcp_data_queue                     remove_anno_list_by_saddr\n     mptcp_incoming_options             mptcp_pm_del_add_timer\n     mptcp_pm_del_add_timer             kfree(entry)\n\nIn remove_anno_list_by_saddr(running on CPU2), after leaving the critical\nzone protected by \"pm.lock\", the entry will be released, which leads to the\noccurrence of uaf in the mptcp_pm_del_add_timer(running on CPU1).\n\nKeeping a reference to add_timer inside the lock, and calling\nsk_stop_timer_sync() with this reference, instead of \"entry-\u003eadd_timer\".\n\nMove list_del(\u0026entry-\u003elist) to mptcp_pm_del_add_timer and inside the pm lock,\ndo not directly access any members of the entry outside the pm lock, which\ncan avoid similar \"entry-\u003ex\" uaf.(CVE-2024-46858)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: stm32/cryp - call finalize with bh disabled\n\nThe finalize operation in interrupt mode produce a produces a spinlock\nrecursion warning.

However, as\ndivision by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure,\nthe value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalid\nand an error code is returned.(CVE-2024-47664)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()\n\nAdd a paranoia check to make sure it doesn't stray beyond valid memory\nregion containing ocfs2 xattr entries when scanning for a match.  It will\nprevent out-of-bound access in case of crafted images.(CVE-2024-47670)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: usbtmc: prevent kernel-usb-infoleak\n\nThe syzbot reported a kernel-usb-infoleak in usbtmc_write,\nwe need to clear the structure before filling fields.(CVE-2024-47671)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't wait for tx queues if firmware is dead\n\nThere is a WARNING in iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() (that was\nrecently converted from just a message), that can be hit if we\nwait for TX queues to become empty after firmware died. Clearly,\nwe can't expect anything from the firmware after it's declared dead.\n\nDon't call iwl_trans_wait_tx_queues_empty() in this case. While it could\nbe a good idea to stop the flow earlier, the flush functions do some\nmaintenance work that is not related to the firmware, so keep that part\nof the code running even when the firmware is not running.\n\n[edit commit message](CVE-2024-47672)",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:memcg: protect concurrent access to mem_cgroup_idrCommit 73f576c04b94 ( mm: memcontrol: fix cgroup creation failure aftermany small jobs ) decoupled the memcg IDs from the CSS ID space to fix thecgroup creation failures.  It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg IDspace.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms formodifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()happen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutexfrom concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idrwas not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently fordifferent memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.We have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency inour fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part oflist_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparentingcode.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentryand inode), the super_block s list_lru didn t have list_lru_one for thememcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object isnot allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehowmemcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg butreturned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.Looking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg s idis not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgshave same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the mostreasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to racebetween multiple idr_remove() calls or race betweenidr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causingmultiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of themwould cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access fromother memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one.",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness\n\nIn sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,\nwhen running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the\nround-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active\nbulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.\n\nThis has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a\nhash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of\nthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,\nand if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host\nstate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the\nhost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is\nassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host\nanymore, are incremented again).\n\nBack when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always\nenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration\nflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but\nthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious\ndecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).\n\nAFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around\nhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in\nitself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this\nis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is\nenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first\nbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this\nmode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the\nqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the\narray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and\nused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,\nwhich is quite impressive in its own right.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on\ndecrement as is used on increment.\n\nThe original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed\nin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply\nbefore that.",
