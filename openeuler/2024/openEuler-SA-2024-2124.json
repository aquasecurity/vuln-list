Later, we use sscanf on this buffer but we don't\nensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to\nOOB read when using sscanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul\ninstead of memdup_user.(CVE-2024-36934)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential kernel bug due to lack

condition in which a rendering job might take just long\nenough to trigger the drm sched job timeout handler but also still\ncomplete before the hard reset is done by the timeout handler.\nThis runs into race conditions not expected by the timeout handler.\nIn some very specific cases it currently may result in a refcount\nimbalance on lima_pm_idle, with a stack dump such as:\n\n[10136.669170]

fcntl/close race is detected\n\nWhen fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with\ndo_lock_file_wait().\nHowever, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock\nwhile denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.\nSeparately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to\nremove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range\nin the middle).\n\nAfter the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in\nlock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used\nto read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.\n\nFix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to\nreliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and\nfiles_struct and is also used by filp_flush().(CVE-2024-41012)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()\n\nxattr in ocfs2 maybe 'non-indexed', which saved with additional space\nrequested.  It's better to check if the memory is out of bound before\nmemcmp, although this possibility mainly comes from crafted poisonous\nimages.(CVE-2024-41016)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entry\n\nWhen system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF core\ncalls hw_params_upon_resume().

If\na reset (nvme reset or IO timeout) occurs before these commands finish,\nreconnect routine may fail to update nvme regs due to insufficient tags,\nwhich will cause kernel hang forever. In order to workaround this issue,\nmaybe we can let reg_read32()/reg_read64()/reg_write32() use reserved\ntags. This maybe safe for nvmf:\n\n1.

The timer is used only to exit from\nwait_for_completion() after a timeout so replacing the call with\nwait_for_completion_timeout() allows to remove the problematic timer and\nits related functions altogether.(CVE-2024-42153)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration\n\nEven on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive \"Bad page state\"s (often on\nflags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been\nset and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from\ndeferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN\nsymptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.\n\n6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (\"mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large\nfolio migration\") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in\n85ce2c517ade (\"memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration\"),\nbut missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own\nlocal list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time\nfolio-\u003e_deferred_list is not empty, but even the \"right\" lock does nothing\nto secure the folio and the list it is on.\n\nFortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so\nfolio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()\nwhile the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding\nsuch a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and\nunmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing\nwas needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).(CVE-2024-42234)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/mm: Add NULL pointer check to crst_table_free() base_crst_free()\n\ncrst_table_free() used to work with NULL pointers before the conversion\nto ptdescs.  Since crst_table_free() can be called with a NULL pointer\n(error handling in crst_table_upgrade() add an explicit check.\n\nAlso add the same check to base_crst_free() for consistency reasons.\n\nIn real life this should not happen, since order two GFP_KERNEL\nallocations will not fail, unless FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC is enabled and used.(CVE-2024-42235)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: cs_dsp: Validate payload length before processing block\n\nMove the payload length check in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_coeff_load()\nto be done before the block is processed.\n\nThe check that the length of a block payload does not exceed the number\nof remaining bytes in the firwmware file buffer was being done near the\nend of the loop iteration. However, some code before that check used the\nlength field without validating it.(CVE-2024-42237)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: cs_dsp: Return error if block header overflows file\n\nReturn an error from cs_dsp_power_up() if a block header is longer\nthan the amount of data left in the file.\n\nThe previous code in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_load_coeff() would loop\nwhile there was enough data left in the file for a valid region. This\nprotected against overrunning the end of the file data, but it didn't\nabort the file processing with an error.(CVE-2024-42238)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelled\n\nGiven a schedule:\n\ntimer1 cb\t\t\ttimer2 cb\n\nbpf_timer_cancel(timer2);\tbpf_timer_cancel(timer1);\n\nBoth bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finish\nexecuting, introducing a lockup.\n\nAdd an atomic_t count named 'cancelling' in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps\ntrack of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.\nWhenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding\ncancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an\nerror (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the\ncallback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock\nsituation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel\nand attempting to cancel one another.\n\nNote that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target\ntimer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from\na callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting\ncur-\u003ecancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop\n(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the\ncaller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to\ncancel as it sees fit without running into errors.\n\nBackground on prior attempts:\n\nEarlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the\nfollowing pattern under timer-\u003elock to publish cancellation status.\n\nlock(t-\u003elock);\nt-\u003ecancelling = true;\nmb();\nif (cur-\u003ecancelling)\n\treturn -EDEADLK;\nunlock(t-\u003elock);\nhrtimer_cancel(t-\u003etimer);\nt-\u003ecancelling = false;\n\nThe store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel\nrequests t-\u003ecancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely\nexecuting callback observes its cancellation status.\n\nIt would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel\nis done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was\nexplored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the\ntimer under timer-\u003elock. This would ensure serialized access to the\ncancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight\nhrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur\nagain.\n\nThus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding\ncancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks\nattempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel.(CVE-2024-42239)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation\n\nWhen BHI mitigation is enabled, if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set\nthen entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the\nclear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler\n(exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the\nentry_SYSENTER_compat() function.\n\nTo address this issue, entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY\nafter making sure the TF flag is cleared.\n\nThe problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:\n\n  $ cat sysenter_step.c\n  int main()\n  { asm(\"pushf; pop %ax; bts $8,%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter\"); }\n\n  $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c\n\n  $ ./sysenter_step\n  Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nThe program is expected to crash, and the #DB handler will issue a warning.\n\nKernel log:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 27 PID: 7000 at arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:1009 exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n  \u003c#DB\u003e\n   ? show_regs+0x68/0x80\n   ? __warn+0x8c/0x140\n   ? exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n   ? report_bug+0x175/0x1a0\n   ? handle_bug+0x44/0x90\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n   ? exc_debug_kernel+0xd2/0x160\n   exc_debug+0x43/0x50\n   asm_exc_debug+0x1e/0x40\n  RIP: 0010:clear_bhb_loop+0x0/0xb0\n  ...\n  \u003c/#DB\u003e\n  \u003cTASK\u003e\n   ? entry_SYSENTER_compat_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x8d\n  \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  [ bp: Massage commit message. ](CVE-2024-42240)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/shmem: disable PMD-sized page cache if needed\n\nFor shmem files, it's possible that PMD-sized page cache can't be\nsupported by xarray.

This code worked fine in the past.\nSo just keep using it.\n\nFix this by returning `prog-\u003etype` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`\nis not present in resolve_prog_type().(CVE-2024-43837)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: virt_wifi: avoid reporting connection success with wrong SSID\n\nWhen user issues a connection with a different SSID than the one\nvirt_wifi has advertised, the __cfg80211_connect_result() will\ntrigger the warning: WARN_ON(bss_not_found).\n\nThe issue is because the connection code in virt_wifi does not\ncheck the SSID from user space (it only checks the BSSID), and\nvirt_wifi will call cfg80211_connect_result() with WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESS\neven if the SSID is different from the one virt_wifi has advertised.\nEventually cfg80211 won't be able to find the cfg80211_bss and generate\nthe warning.\n\nFixed it by checking the SSID (from user space) in the connection code.(CVE-2024-43841)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtw89: Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()\n\nIn rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() 'status-\u003ehe_gi' is compared to array size.\nBut then 'rate-\u003ehe_gi' is used as array index instead of 'status-\u003ehe_gi'.\nThis can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of 'rate-\u003ehe_gi' is\nnot equal to 'status-\u003ehe_gi' and is bigger than array size.

The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file\nis created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that\nopened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it\nwould set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,\nand any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is\nmarked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was\nset (under the event_mutex).\n\nAll the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a\npointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last\nreference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it\nis safe to free the file meta data.\n\nA shortcut was made for the \"format\" file. It's i_private would point to\nthe \"call\" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is\nbecause all format files are the same for the same \"call\", so it was\nthought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files\nmaintain state (like the \"enable\", \"trigger\", etc). But this meant if the\nfile were to disappear, the \"format\" file would be unaware of it.\n\nThis caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that\nwould create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would\nread the user_events format files:\n\nIn one console run:\n\n # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events\n # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done\n\nAnd in another console run:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/\n # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2\u003e/dev/null\n\nWith KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report\n(which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking\nthe file's meta data flag \"EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\", so it would access the\nevent that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.\n\nAfter inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check\nthe EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a\nnew helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the\nevent_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the\nEVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file\npointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use\nthe event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and\nwas not released since the event_file_file() call.(CVE-2024-43891)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Skip Recompute DSC Params if no Stream on Link\n\n[why]\nEncounter NULL pointer dereference uner mst + dsc setup.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n    PGD 0 P4D 0\n    Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n    CPU: 4 PID: 917 Comm: sway Not tainted 6.3.9-arch1-1 #1 124dc55df4f5272ccb409f39ef4872fc2b3376a2\n    Hardware name: LENOVO 20NKS01Y00/20NKS01Y00, BIOS R12ET61W(1.31 ) 07/28/2022\n    RIP: 0010:drm_dp_atomic_find_time_slots+0x5e/0x260 [drm_display_helper]\n    Code: 01 00 00 48 8b 85 60 05 00 00 48 63 80 88 00 00 00 3b 43 28 0f 8d 2e 01 00 00 48 8b 53 30 48 8d 04 80 48 8d 04 c2 48 8b 40 18 \u003c48\u003e 8\u003e\n    RSP: 0018:ffff960cc2df77d8 EFLAGS: 00010293\n    RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8afb87e81280 RCX: 0000000000000224\n    RDX: ffff8afb9ee37c00 RSI: ffff8afb8da1a578 RDI: ffff8afb87e81280\n    RBP: ffff8afb83d67000 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: ffff8afb9652f850\n    R10: ffff960cc2df7908 R11: 0000000000000002 R12: 0000000000000000\n    R13: ffff8afb8d7688a0 R14: ffff8afb8da1a578 R15: 0000000000000224\n    FS:  00007f4dac35ce00(0000) GS:ffff8afe30b00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n    CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n    CR2: 0000000000000008 CR3: 000000010ddc6000 CR4: 00000000003506e0\n    Call Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n     ? __die+0x23/0x70\n     ? page_fault_oops+0x171/0x4e0\n     ? plist_add+0xbe/0x100\n     ? exc_page_fault+0x7c/0x180\n     ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n     ? drm_dp_atomic_find_time_slots+0x5e/0x260 [drm_display_helper 0e67723696438d8e02b741593dd50d80b44c2026]\n     ? drm_dp_atomic_find_time_slots+0x28/0x260 [drm_display_helper 0e67723696438d8e02b741593dd50d80b44c2026]\n     compute_mst_dsc_configs_for_link+0x2ff/0xa40 [amdgpu 62e600d2a75e9158e1cd0a243bdc8e6da040c054]\n     ? fill_plane_buffer_attributes+0x419/0x510 [amdgpu 62e600d2a75e9158e1cd0a243bdc8e6da040c054]\n     compute_mst_dsc_configs_for_state+0x1e1/0x250 [amdgpu 62e600d2a75e9158e1cd0a243bdc8e6da040c054]\n     amdgpu_dm_atomic_check+0xecd/0x1190 [amdgpu 62e600d2a75e9158e1cd0a243bdc8e6da040c054]\n     drm_atomic_check_only+0x5c5/0xa40\n     drm_mode_atomic_ioctl+0x76e/0xbc0\n\n[how]\ndsc recompute should be skipped if no mode change detected on the new\nrequest.

vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate\n\nfuse_notify_store(), unlike fuse_do_readpage(), does not enable page\nzeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).\n\nSo fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page\ncontents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file)\nbefore marking the page uptodate.\n\nThe current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized, which\nmakes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().\n\nThis is an information leak, but only affects systems which do not\nenable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the\ncorresponding kernel command line parameter).(CVE-2024-44947)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Forward soft recovery errors to userspace\n\nAs we discussed before[1], soft recovery should be\nforwarded to userspace, or we can get into a really\nbad state where apps will keep submitting hanging\ncommand buffers cascading us to a hard reset.\n\n1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/bf23d5ed-9a6b-43e7-84ee-8cbfd0d60f18@froggi.es/\n(cherry picked from commit 434967aadbbbe3ad9103cc29e9a327de20fdba01)(CVE-2024-44961)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinfmt_flat: Fix corruption when not offsetting data start\n\nCommit 04d82a6d0881 (\"binfmt_flat: allow not offsetting data start\")\nintroduced a RISC-V specific variant of the FLAT format which does\nnot allocate any space for the (obsolete) array of shared library\npointers. However, it did not disable the code which initializes the\narray, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long) bytes before the DATA\nsegment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.\n\nIntroduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE which depends on the state of\nCONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization of\nthe shared library pointer region so that it will only be initialized\nif space is reserved for it.(CVE-2024-44966)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix a possible memory leak in bcm_sf2_mdio_register()\n\nbcm_sf2_mdio_register() calls of_phy_find_device() and then\nphy_device_remove() in a loop to remove existing PHY devices.\nof_phy_find_device() eventually calls bus_find_device(), which calls\nget_device() on the returned struct device * to increment the refcount.\nThe current implementation does not decrement the refcount, which causes\nmemory leak.\n\nThis commit adds the missing phy_device_free() call to decrement the\nrefcount via put_device() to balance the refcount.(CVE-2024-44971)",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelledGiven a schedule:timer1 cb   timer2 cbbpf_timer_cancel(timer2); bpf_timer_cancel(timer1);Both bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finishexecuting, introducing a lockup.Add an atomic_t count named  cancelling  in bpf_hrtimer. This keepstrack of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.Whenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstandingcancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with anerror (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for thecallback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlocksituation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in paralleland attempting to cancel one another.Note that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the targettimer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked froma callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detectingcur-\u003ecancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case thecaller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue tocancel as it sees fit without running into errors.Background on prior attempts:Earlier versions of this patch used a bool  cancelling  bit and used thefollowing pattern under timer-\u003elock to publish cancellation status.lock(t-\u003elock);t-\u003ecancelling = true;mb();if (cur-\u003ecancelling) return -EDEADLK;unlock(t-\u003elock);hrtimer_cancel(t-\u003etimer);t-\u003ecancelling = false;The store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallelrequests t-\u003ecancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallelyexecuting callback observes its cancellation status.It would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancelis done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option wasexplored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting thetimer under timer-\u003elock. This would ensure serialized access to thecancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flighthrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occuragain.Thus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstandingcancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacksattempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel.",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Have format file honor EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\n\nWhen eventfs was introduced, special care had to be done to coordinate the\nfreeing of the file meta data with the files that are exposed to user\nspace. The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file\nis created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that\nopened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it\nwould set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,\nand any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is\nmarked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was\nset (under the event_mutex).\n\nAll the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a\npointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last\nreference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it\nis safe to free the file meta data.\n\nA shortcut was made for the \"format\" file. It's i_private would point to\nthe \"call\" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is\nbecause all format files are the same for the same \"call\", so it was\nthought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files\nmaintain state (like the \"enable\", \"trigger\", etc). But this meant if the\nfile were to disappear, the \"format\" file would be unaware of it.\n\nThis caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that\nwould create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would\nread the user_events format files:\n\nIn one console run:\n\n # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events\n # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done\n\nAnd in another console run:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/\n # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2\u003e/dev/null\n\nWith KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report\n(which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking\nthe file's meta data flag \"EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED\", so it would access the\nevent that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.\n\nAfter inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check\nthe EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a\nnew helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the\nevent_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the\nEVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file\npointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use\nthe event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and\nwas not released since the event_file_file() call.",

[0]The repro first creates a listener with SO_REUSEPORT.
