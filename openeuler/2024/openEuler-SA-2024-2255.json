      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/gt: Cleanup partial engine discovery failures\n\nIf we abort driver initialisation in the middle of gt/engine discovery,\nsome engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely setup\nengines only have 'engine-\u003erelease == NULL' and so will leak any of the\ncommon objects allocated.\n\nv2:\n - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now.  It's not really\n   worth it with just a single callsite at the moment.  (Janusz)(CVE-2022-48893)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix to avoid dirent corruption\n\nAs Al reported in link[1]:\n\nf2fs_rename()\n...\n\tif (old_dir != new_dir \u0026\u0026 !whiteout)\n\t\tf2fs_set_link(old_inode, old_dir_entry,\n\t\t\t\t\told_dir_page, new_dir);\n\telse\n\t\tf2fs_put_page(old_dir_page, 0);\n\nYou want correct inumber in the \"..\" link.  And cross-directory\nrename does move the source to new parent, even if you'd been asked\nto leave a whiteout in the old place.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231017055040.GN800259@ZenIV/\n\nWith below testcase, it may cause dirent corruption, due to it missed\nto call f2fs_set_link() to update \"..\" link to new directory.\n- mkdir -p dir/foo\n- renameat2 -w dir/foo bar\n\n[ASSERT] (__chk_dots_dentries:1421)  --\u003e Bad inode number[0x4] for '..', parent parent ino is [0x3]\n[FSCK] other corrupted bugs                           [Fail](CVE-2023-52444)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nefivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported\n\nIf SetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never assign\na callback for that function. At the same time mount the efivarfs as\nRO so no one can call that.  However, we never check the permission flags\nwhen someone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a result this leads to a\ncrash looking like this:\n\n$ mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars\n$ efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK\n\n[  303.279166] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000\n[  303.280482] Mem abort info:\n[  303.280854]   ESR = 0x0000000086000004\n[  303.281338]   EC = 0x21: IABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  303.282016]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  303.282414]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  303.282821]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n[  303.283771] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000004258c000\n[  303.284913] [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000\n[  303.286076] Internal error: Oops: 0000000086000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  303.286936] Modules linked in: qrtr tpm_tis tpm_tis_core crct10dif_ce arm_smccc_trng rng_core drm fuse ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  303.288586] CPU: 1 PID: 755 Comm: efi-updatevar Not tainted 6.3.0-rc1-00108-gc7d0c4695c68 #1\n[  303.289748] Hardware name: Unknown Unknown Product/Unknown Product, BIOS 2023.04-00627-g88336918701d 04/01/2023\n[  303.291150] pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  303.292123] pc : 0x0\n[  303.292443] lr : efivar_set_variable_locked+0x74/0xec\n[  303.293156] sp : ffff800008673c10\n[  303.293619] x29: ffff800008673c10 x28: ffff0000037e8000 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  303.294592] x26: 0000000000000800 x25: ffff000002467400 x24: 0000000000000027\n[  303.295572] x23: ffffd49ea9832000 x22: ffff0000020c9800 x21: ffff000002467000\n[  303.296566] x20: 0000000000000001 x19: 00000000000007fc x18: 0000000000000000\n[  303.297531] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 0000aaaac807ab54\n[  303.298495] x14: ed37489f673633c0 x13: 71c45c606de13f80 x12: 47464259e219acf4\n[  303.299453] x11: ffff000002af7b01 x10: 0000000000000003 x9 : 0000000000000002\n[  303.300431] x8 : 0000000000000010 x7 : ffffd49ea8973230 x6 : 0000000000a85201\n[  303.301412] x5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : ffff0000020c9800 x3 : 00000000000007fc\n[  303.302370] x2 : 0000000000000027 x1 : ffff000002467400 x0 : ffff000002467000\n[  303.303341] Call trace:\n[  303.303679]  0x0\n[  303.303938]  efivar_entry_set_get_size+0x98/0x16c\n[  303.304585]  efivarfs_file_write+0xd0/0x1a4\n[  303.305148]  vfs_write+0xc4/0x2e4\n[  303.305601]  ksys_write+0x70/0x104\n[  303.306073]  __arm64_sys_write+0x1c/0x28\n[  303.306622]  invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114\n[  303.307156]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x44/0xec\n[  303.307803]  do_el0_svc+0x38/0x98\n[  303.308268]  el0_svc+0x2c/0x84\n[  303.308702]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0xf4/0x120\n[  303.309293]  el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194\n[  303.309794] Code: ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????

All these are\nprotected by a test skb-\u003eprotocol == ETH_P_802_2. Which does not\nprotect against this tun scenario.\n\nBut the mac_len test added in this patch in llc_fixup_skb will\nindirectly protect those too. That is called from llc_rcv before any\nother LLC code.\n\nIt is tempting to just add a blanket mac_len check in llc_rcv, but\nnot sure whether that could break valid LLC paths that do not assume\nan Ethernet header. 802.2 LLC may be used on top of non-802.3\nprotocols in principle. The below referenced commit shows that used\nto, on top of Token Ring.\n\nAt least one of the three eth_hdr uses goes back to before the start\nof git history. But the one that syzbot exercises is introduced in\nthis commit. That commit is old enough (2008), that effectively all\nstable kernels should receive this.(CVE-2023-52843)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhv_netvsc: Register VF in netvsc_probe if NET_DEVICE_REGISTER missed\n\nIf hv_netvsc driver is unloaded and reloaded, the NET_DEVICE_REGISTER\nhandler cannot perform VF register successfully as the register call\nis received before netvsc_probe is finished. This is because we\nregister register_netdevice_notifier() very early( even before\nvmbus_driver_register()).\nTo fix this, we try to register each such matching VF( if it is visible\nas a netdevice) at the end of netvsc_probe.(CVE-2024-26820)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: honor table dormant flag from netdev release event path\n\nCheck for table dormant flag otherwise netdev release event path tries\nto unregister an already unregistered hook.\n\n[524854.857999] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[524854.858010] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3386599 at net/netfilter/core.c:501 __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x21a/0x260\n[...]\n[524854.858848] CPU: 0 PID: 3386599 Comm: kworker/u32:2 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc3+ #365\n[524854.858869] Workqueue: netns cleanup_net\n[524854.858886] RIP: 0010:__nf_unregister_net_hook+0x21a/0x260\n[524854.858903] Code: 24 e8 aa 73 83 ff 48 63 43 1c 83 f8 01 0f 85 3d ff ff ff e8 98 d1 f0 ff 48 8b 3c 24 e8 8f 73 83 ff 48 63 43 1c e9 26 ff ff ff \u003c0f\u003e 0b 48 83 c4 18 48 c7 c7 00 68 e9 82 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41\n[524854.858914] RSP: 0018:ffff8881e36d79e0 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[524854.858926] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8881339ae790 RCX: ffffffff81ba524a\n[524854.858936] RDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: ffff8881c8a16438\n[524854.858945] RBP: ffff8881c8a16438 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: ffffed103c6daf34\n[524854.858954] R10: ffff8881e36d79a7 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000000000000005\n[524854.858962] R13: ffff8881c8a16000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff8881351b5a00\n[524854.858971] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff888390800000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[524854.858982] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[524854.858991] CR2: 00007fc9be0f16f4 CR3: 00000001437cc004 CR4: 00000000001706f0\n[524854.859000] Call Trace:\n[524854.859006]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[524854.859013]  ?

Since dm always splits data and flush operation into two\nseparate io, io size of flush submitted by dm always is 0, make_request()\nwill not be called in md_submit_flush_data().

It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg ID\nspace.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms for\nmodifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()\nhappen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutex\nfrom concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idr\nwas not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently for\ndifferent memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.\n\nWe have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency in\nour fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part of\nlist_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparenting\ncode.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentry\nand inode), the super_block's list_lru didn't have list_lru_one for the\nmemcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object is\nnot allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehow\nmemcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg but\nreturned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.\n\nLooking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg's id\nis not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgs\nhave same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the most\nreasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to race\nbetween multiple idr_remove() calls or race between\nidr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causing\nmultiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of them\nwould cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access from\nother memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one.(CVE-2024-43892)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: core: check uartclk for zero to avoid divide by zero\n\nCalling ioctl TIOCSSERIAL with an invalid baud_base can\nresult in uartclk being zero, which will result in a\ndivide by zero error in uart_get_divisor().

It is sysctl and can change\nat any moment, so 2 loads could see 2 different values in theory with\nunpredictable consequences.\n\nIssue exactly one load for consistent value across one exec.(CVE-2024-46826)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness\n\nIn sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,\nwhen running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the\nround-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active\nbulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.\n\nThis has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a\nhash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of\nthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,\nand if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host\nstate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the\nhost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is\nassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host\nanymore, are incremented again).\n\nBack when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always\nenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration\nflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but\nthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious\ndecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).\n\nAFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around\nhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in\nitself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this\nis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is\nenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first\nbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this\nmode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the\nqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the\narray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and\nused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,\nwhich is quite impressive in its own right.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on\ndecrement as is used on increment.\n\nThe original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed\nin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply\nbefore that.(CVE-2024-46828)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete\n\nIn reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could be unkind since we aren't\nholding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transient\nincorrect answer.  In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), which\ncould happen if we have extent tree corruption.  Change that to return\n-EUCLEAN.  In do_walk_down() we catch this case and handle it correctly,\nhowever we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate error code.\nFinally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convert\nthat to proper error handling.  Also adjust the error message so we can\nactually do something with the information.(CVE-2024-46840)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel: Limit the period on Haswell\n\nRunning the ltp test cve-2015-3290 concurrently reports the following\nwarnings.\n\nperfevents: irq loop stuck!\n  WARNING: CPU: 31 PID: 32438 at arch/x86/events/intel/core.c:3174\n  intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cNMI\u003e\n   ? __warn+0xa4/0x220\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? __report_bug+0x123/0x130\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? __report_bug+0x123/0x130\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? report_bug+0x3e/0xa0\n   ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x50\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n   ? irq_work_claim+0x1e/0x40\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   perf_event_nmi_handler+0x3d/0x60\n   nmi_handle+0x104/0x330\n\nThanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low\ninitial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers\nthe defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the\ndetails, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)\n\nThe HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL\nevent, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the\nsame as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum\nperiod of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.\n\nHSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the\nHyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware\nhas more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message\n'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed\nwith a period \u003c 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum\nperiod of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.\nThe recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.\nBecause it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings\nextra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue\nhas been reported so far.(CVE-2024-46848)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dpaa: Pad packets to ETH_ZLEN\n\nWhen sending packets under 60 bytes, up to three bytes of the buffer\nfollowing the data may be leaked.

It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg IDspace.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms formodifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()happen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutexfrom concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idrwas not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently fordifferent memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.We have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency inour fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part oflist_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparentingcode.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentryand inode), the super_block s list_lru didn t have list_lru_one for thememcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object isnot allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehowmemcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg butreturned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.Looking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg s idis not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgshave same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the mostreasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to racebetween multiple idr_remove() calls or race betweenidr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causingmultiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of themwould cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access fromother memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one.",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness\n\nIn sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,\nwhen running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the\nround-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active\nbulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.\n\nThis has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a\nhash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of\nthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,\nand if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host\nstate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the\nhost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is\nassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host\nanymore, are incremented again).\n\nBack when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always\nenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration\nflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but\nthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious\ndecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).\n\nAFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around\nhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in\nitself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this\nis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is\nenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first\nbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this\nmode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the\nqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the\narray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and\nused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,\nwhich is quite impressive in its own right.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on\ndecrement as is used on increment.\n\nThe original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed\nin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply\nbefore that.",
