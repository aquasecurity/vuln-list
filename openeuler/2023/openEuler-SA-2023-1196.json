      "Text": "cURL is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various protocols.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nlibcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several FTP settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily. The settings in questions are `CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT`, `CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER`, `CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC` and `CURLOPT_USE_SSL` level.(CVE-2023-27535)\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited reuse. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, two SSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily.(CVE-2023-27538)\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the GSS delegation (`CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION`) option had been changed that could have changed the user's permissions in a second transfer. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, this GSS delegation setting was left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily, affecting krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.(CVE-2023-27536)\n\ncurl supports communicating using the TELNET protocol and as a part of this it offers users to pass on user name and \"telnet options\" for the server\nnegotiation. Due to lack of proper input scrubbing and without it being the documented functionality, curl would pass on user name and telnet options to the server as provided. This could allow users to pass in carefully crafted content that pass on content or do option negotiation without the application intending to do so. In particular if an application for example allows users to provide the data or parts of the data.(CVE-2023-27533)\n\ncurl supports SFTP transfers. curl's SFTP implementation offers a special feature in the path component of URLs: a tilde (`~`) character as the first\npath element in the path to denotes a path relative to the user's home directory. This is supported because of wording in the [once proposed\nto-become RFC draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04) that was to dictate how SFTP URLs work. Due to a bug, the handling of the tilde in SFTP path did however not only replace it when it is used stand-alone as the first path element but also wrongly when used as a mere prefix in the first element. Using a path like `/~2/foo` when accessing a server using the user `dan` (with home directory `/home/dan`) would then quite suprisingly access the file `/home/dan2/foo`. This can be taken advantage of to circumvent filtering or worse.(CVE-2023-27534)",
