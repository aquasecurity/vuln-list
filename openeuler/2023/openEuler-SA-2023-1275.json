      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side.(CVE-2022-4382)\n\nThe Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\n\n(CVE-2023-1998)\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the DPT I2O Controller driver. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.(CVE-2023-2007)\n\nA null pointer dereference issue was found in can protocol in net/can/af_can.c in the Linux before Linux. ml_priv may not be initialized in the receive path of CAN frames. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.(CVE-2023-2166)\n\nA vulnerability was found in compare_netdev_and_ip in drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c in RDMA in the Linux Kernel. The improper cleanup results in out-of-boundary read, where a local user can utilize this problem to crash the system or escalation of privilege.(CVE-2023-2176)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The userspace \"data-\u003eblock[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution.(CVE-2023-2194)\n\nA denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component.(CVE-2023-2269)\n\nA speculative pointer dereference problem exists in the Linux Kernel on the do_prlimit() function. The resource argument value is controlled and is used in pointer arithmetic for the 'rlim' variable and can be used to leak the contents. We recommend upgrading past version 6.1.8 or commit 739790605705ddcf18f21782b9c99ad7d53a8c11(CVE-2023-0458)\n\nqfq_change_class in net/sched/sch_qfq.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.13 allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax can exceed QFQ_MIN_LMAX.(CVE-2023-31436)",
