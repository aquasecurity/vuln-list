This issue may result in limited confidentiality and integrity.(CVE-2023-23915)\n\nA flaw was found in the Curl package, where the HSTS mechanism would be ignored by subsequent transfers when done on the same command line because the state would not be properly carried. This issue may result in limited confidentiality and integrity.(CVE-2023-23914)\n\ncurl supports \"chained\" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms. The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by using many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.(CVE-2023-23916)",
