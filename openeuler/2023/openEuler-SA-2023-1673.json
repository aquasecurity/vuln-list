      "Text": "Mozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\n\nMozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox for Android 79. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 80, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.2, Thunderbird \u003c 78.2, and Firefox for Android \u003c 80.(CVE-2020-15670)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 81, Thunderbird \u003c 78.3, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.3.(CVE-2020-15673)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 81.(CVE-2020-15674)\n\nWhen processing surfaces, the lifetime may outlive a persistent buffer leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 81.(CVE-2020-15675)\n\nIf a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 82.(CVE-2020-15680)\n\nWhen multiple WASM threads had a reference to a module, and were looking up exported functions, one WASM thread could have overwritten another's entry in a shared stub table, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 82.(CVE-2020-15681)\n\nWhen a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 82.(CVE-2020-15682)\n\nMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.4, Firefox \u003c 82, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.4.(CVE-2020-15683)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 82.(CVE-2020-15684)\n\nSide-channel information leakage in graphics in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.66 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.(CVE-2020-16012)\n\nUse after free in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted SCTP packet.(CVE-2020-16044)\n\nIn certain circumstances, the MCallGetProperty opcode can be emitted with unmet assumptions resulting in an exploitable use-after-free condition. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 82.0.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.4.1, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.4.2.(CVE-2020-26950)\n\n(CVE-2020-26951)\n\n(CVE-2020-26953)\n\n(CVE-2020-26956)\n\n(CVE-2020-26958)\n\n(CVE-2020-26959)\n\n(CVE-2020-26960)\n\n(CVE-2020-26961)\n\n(CVE-2020-26962)\n\n(CVE-2020-26965)\n\n(CVE-2020-26968)\n\n(CVE-2020-26969)\n\nCertain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap buffer overflow on some video drivers. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84, Thunderbird \u003c 78.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.6.(CVE-2020-26971)\n\nThe lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84.(CVE-2020-26972)\n\nCertain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect components being removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84, Thunderbird \u003c 78.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.6.(CVE-2020-26973)\n\nWhen flex-basis was used on a table wrapper, a StyleGenericFlexBasis object could have been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap user-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84, Thunderbird \u003c 78.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.6.(CVE-2020-26974)\n\nWhen a HTTPS pages was embedded in a HTTP page, and there was a service worker registered for the former, the service worker could have intercepted the request for the secure page despite the iframe not being a secure context due to the (insecure) framing. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84.(CVE-2020-26976)\n\nUsing techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84, Thunderbird \u003c 78.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.6.(CVE-2020-26978)\n\nWhen a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84.(CVE-2020-26979)\n\nWhen an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive \u003call_urls\u003e, the proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP address. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84, Thunderbird \u003c 78.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.6.(CVE-2020-35111)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84, Thunderbird \u003c 78.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.6.(CVE-2020-35113)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 84.(CVE-2020-35114)\n\nIf a user clicked into a specifically crafted PDF, the PDF reader could be confused into leaking cross-origin information, when said information is served as chunked data. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85, Thunderbird \u003c 78.7, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.7.(CVE-2021-23953)\n\nUsing the new logical assignment operators in a JavaScript switch statement could have caused a type confusion, leading to a memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85, Thunderbird \u003c 78.7, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.7.(CVE-2021-23954)\n\nThe browser could have been confused into transferring a pointer lock state into another tab, which could have lead to clickjacking attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23955)\n\nAn ambiguous file picker design could have confused users who intended to select and upload a single file into uploading a whole directory. This was addressed by adding a new prompt. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23956)\n\nThe browser could have been confused into transferring a screen sharing state into another tab, which would leak unintended information. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23958)\n\nPerforming garbage collection on re-declared JavaScript variables resulted in a user-after-poison, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85, Thunderbird \u003c 78.7, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.7.(CVE-2021-23960)\n\nFurther techniques that built on the slipstream research combined with a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23961)\n\nIncorrect use of the '\u003cRowCountChanged\u003e' method could have led to a user-after-poison and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23962)\n\nWhen sharing geolocation during an active WebRTC share, Firefox could have reset the webRTC sharing state in the user interface, leading to loss of control over the currently granted permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23963)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85, Thunderbird \u003c 78.7, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.7.(CVE-2021-23964)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 84. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.(CVE-2021-23965)\n\nIf Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect served in the frame was reported in the violation report; as opposed to the original frame URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86, Thunderbird \u003c 78.8, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.8.(CVE-2021-23968)\n\nAs specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a violation report, \"User agents need to ensure that the source file is the URL requested by the page, pre-redirects. If that’s not possible, user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin to avoid unintentional leakage.\" Under certain types of redirects, Firefox incorrectly set the source file to be the destination of the redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect destination's origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86, Thunderbird \u003c 78.8, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.8.(CVE-2021-23969)\n\nContext-specific code was included in a shared jump table; resulting in assertions being triggered in multithreaded wasm code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86.(CVE-2021-23970)\n\nWhen processing a redirect with a conflicting Referrer-Policy, Firefox would have adopted the redirect's Referrer-Policy. This would have potentially resulted in more information than intended by the original origin being provided to the destination of the redirect. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86.(CVE-2021-23971)\n\nOne phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example 'https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com'. To mitigate this type of attack, Firefox will display a warning dialog; however, this warning dialog would not have been displayed if evil.com used a redirect that was cached by the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86.(CVE-2021-23972)\n\nWhen trying to load a cross-origin resource in an audio/video context a decoding error may have resulted, and the content of that error may have revealed information about the resource. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86, Thunderbird \u003c 78.8, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.8.(CVE-2021-23973)\n\nThe DOMParser API did not properly process '\u003cnoscript\u003e' elements for escaping. This could be used as an mXSS vector to bypass an HTML Sanitizer. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86.(CVE-2021-23974)\n\nThe developer page about:memory has a Measure function for exploring what object types the browser has allocated and their sizes. When this function was invoked we incorrectly called the sizeof function, instead of using the API method that checks for invalid pointers. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86.(CVE-2021-23975)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 85 and Firefox ESR 78.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86, Thunderbird \u003c 78.8, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.8.(CVE-2021-23978)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 85. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 86.(CVE-2021-23979)\n\nA texture upload of a Pixel Buffer Object could have confused the WebGL code to skip binding the buffer used to unpack it, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable information leak or crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.(CVE-2021-23981)\n\nUsing techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have scanned both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine utilizing WebRTC connections. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.(CVE-2021-23982)\n\nBy causing a transition on a parent node by removing a CSS rule, an invalid property for a marker could have been applied, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 87.(CVE-2021-23983)\n\nA malicious extension could have opened a popup window lacking an address bar. The title of the popup lacking an address bar should not be fully controllable, but in this situation was. This could have been used to spoof a website and attempt to trick the user into providing credentials. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.(CVE-2021-23984)\n\nIf an attacker is able to alter specific about:config values (for example malware running on the user's computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the user's browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 87.(CVE-2021-23985)\n\nA malicious extension with the 'search' permission could have installed a new search engine whose favicon referenced a cross-origin URL. The response to this cross-origin request could have been read by the extension, allowing a same-origin policy bypass by the extension, which should not have cross-origin permissions. This cross-origin request was made without cookies, so the sensitive information disclosed by the violation was limited to local-network resources or resources that perform IP-based authentication. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 87.(CVE-2021-23986)\n\nMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86 and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.(CVE-2021-23987)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 87.(CVE-2021-23988)\n\nA WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory corruption and an out of bound write. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-23994)\n\nWhen Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that were previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-23995)\n\nBy utilizing 3D CSS in conjunction with Javascript, content could have been rendered outside the webpage's viewport, resulting in a spoofing attack that could have been used for phishing or other attacks on a user. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-23996)\n\nDue to unexpected data type conversions, a use-after-free could have occurred when interacting with the font cache. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-23997)\n\nThrough complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have inherited a secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-23998)\n\nIf a Blob URL was loaded through some unusual user interaction, it could have been loaded by the System Principal and granted additional privileges that should not be granted to web content. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-23999)\n\nA race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as \u0026lt;input type=\"file\"\u0026gt;) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-24000)\n\nA compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-24001)\n\nWhen a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D), the newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed arbitrary commands to be sent to the FTP server. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-24002)\n\nLack of escaping allowed HTML injection when a webpage was viewed in Reader View. While a Content Security Policy prevents direct code execution, HTML injection is still possible. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-29944)\n\nThe WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a null read and result in a crash. *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other platforms are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-29945)\n\nPorts that were written as an integer overflow above the bounds of a 16-bit integer could have bypassed port blocking restrictions when used in the Alt-Svc header. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-29946)\n\nMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.(CVE-2021-29947)\n\nWhen Web Render components were destructed, a race condition could have caused undefined behavior, and we presume that with enough effort may have been exploitable to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.0.1 and Firefox for Android \u003c 88.1.3.(CVE-2021-29952)\n\nA malicious webpage could have forced a Firefox for Android user into executing attacker-controlled JavaScript in the context of another domain, resulting in a Universal Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. Further details are being temporarily withheld to allow users an opportunity to update.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.0.1 and Firefox for Android \u003c 88.1.3.(CVE-2021-29953)\n\nA transient execution vulnerability, named Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI) allowed an attacker to leak arbitrary memory addresses and may have also enabled JIT type confusion attacks. (A related vulnerability, Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB), did not affect Firefox.). This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9 and Firefox \u003c 87.(CVE-2021-29955)\n\nWhen a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 89.(CVE-2021-29959)\n\nFirefox used to cache the last filename used for printing a file. When generating a filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title. The caching and suggestion techniques combined may have lead to the title of a website visited during private browsing mode being stored on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 89.(CVE-2021-29960)\n\nWhen styling and rendering an oversized `\u003cselect\u003e` element, Firefox did not apply correct clipping which allowed an attacker to paint over the user interface. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 89.(CVE-2021-29961)\n\nA malicious website that causes an HTTP Authentication dialog to be spawned could trick the built-in password manager to suggest passwords for the currently active website instead of the website that triggered the dialog. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 89.(CVE-2021-29965)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 89.(CVE-2021-29966)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88 and Firefox ESR 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.11, Firefox \u003c 89, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.11.(CVE-2021-29967)\n\nA malicious webpage could have triggered a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. *This bug could only be triggered when accessibility was enabled.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.12, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.12, and Firefox \u003c 90.(CVE-2021-29970)\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found via testing, and traced to an out-of-date Cairo library. Updating the library resolved the issue, and may have remediated other, unknown security vulnerabilities as well. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 90.(CVE-2021-29972)\n\nWhen network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 90.(CVE-2021-29974)\n\nThrough a series of DOM manipulations, a message, over which the attacker had control of the text but not HTML or formatting, could be overlaid on top of another domain (with the new domain correctly shown in the address bar) resulting in possible user confusion. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 90.(CVE-2021-29975)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in code shared between Firefox and Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.12, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.12, and Firefox \u003c 90.(CVE-2021-29976)\n\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 89. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 90.(CVE-2021-29977)\n\nUninitialized memory in a canvas object could have caused an incorrect free() leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.13, Thunderbird \u003c 91, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.13, and Firefox \u003c 91.(CVE-2021-29980)\n\nAn issue present in lowering/register allocation could have led to obscure but deterministic register confusion failures in JITted code that would lead to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 91 and Thunderbird \u003c 91.(CVE-2021-29981)\n\nDue to incorrect JIT optimization, we incorrectly interpreted data from the wrong type of object, resulting in the potential leak of a single bit of memory.

If the Web Extension lacked the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in the redirect, this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data the Web Extension should have access to. This was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL. This is related to CVE-2021-43532 but in the context of Web Extensions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 94.(CVE-2021-43531)\n\nThe 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URL after redirects. By embedding an image that triggered authentication flows - in conjunction with a Content Security Policy that stopped a redirection chain in the middle - the final image URL could be one that contained an authentication token used to takeover a user account. If a website tricked a user into copy and pasting the image link back to the page, the page would be able to steal the authentication tokens.

The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.(CVE-2022-24713)\n\nAn attacker could have caused a use-after-free by forcing a text reflow in an SVG object leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.",
