QuerySet.annotate(), QuerySet.alias(), QuerySet.aggregate(), and QuerySet.extra() are subject to SQL injection in column aliases, when using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the **kwargs passed to these methods on MySQL and MariaDB.(CVE-2025-59681)\n\nA critical vulnerability was found in Django up to 4.2.24/5.1.12/5.2.6. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-22. The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Upgrading to version 4.2.25, 5.1.13 or 5.2.7 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-59682)",
