      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal\n\nBefore 456d8aa37d0f (\"PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to\navoid use-after-free\"), we would free the ASPM link only after the last\nfunction on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.\n\nThat was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function,\nlink-\u003edownstream would point to free'd memory after.\n\nAfter above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function\nremoval on the bus pertaining to a given link.\n\nThat is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream\nport, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which\nstill remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.\n\nThe resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because\npciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.\n\nOn that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.\nFree exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is\nobsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log](CVE-2024-58093)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: add check read-only before truncation in jfs_truncate_nolock()\n\nAdded a check for \"read-only\" mode in the `jfs_truncate_nolock`\nfunction to avoid errors related to writing to a read-only\nfilesystem.\n\nCall stack:\n\nblock_write_begin() {\n  jfs_write_failed() {\n    jfs_truncate() {\n      jfs_truncate_nolock() {\n        txEnd() {\n          ...\n          log = JFS_SBI(tblk-\u003esb)-\u003elog;\n          // (log == NULL)\n\nIf the `isReadOnly(ip)` condition is triggered in\n`jfs_truncate_nolock`, the function execution will stop, and no\nfurther data modification will occur. Instead, the `xtTruncate`\nfunction will be called with the \"COMMIT_WMAP\" flag, preventing\nmodifications in \"read-only\" mode.(CVE-2024-58094)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame\n\nAndrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service\nload-balancing in case of vmxnet3.\n\nIf a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as\nIPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case\nof vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped\non the path.\n\nvmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp()\nthrough vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:\n\n  page = virt_to_page(xdpf-\u003edata);\n  tbi-\u003edma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +\n                  VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;\n  dma_sync_single_for_device(\u0026adapter-\u003epdev-\u003edev,\n                             tbi-\u003edma_addr, buf_size,\n                             DMA_TO_DEVICE);\n\nThe above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM), but the XDP\nBPF program could have moved xdp-\u003edata. While the passed buf_size is\ncorrect (xdpf-\u003elen), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which\ncan be calculated as xdpf-\u003edata - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp-\u003edata -\nxdp-\u003edata_hard_start.(CVE-2024-58099)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrds: sysctl: rds_tcp_{rcv,snd}buf: avoid using current-\u003ensproxy\n\nAs mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'\nstructure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:\n\n- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only\n  from the opener's netns.\n\n- current-\u003ensproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'\n  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by\n  syzbot [1] using acct(2).\n\nThe per-netns structure can be obtained from the table-\u003edata using\ncontainer_of(), then the 'net' one can be retrieved from the listen\nsocket (if available).(CVE-2025-21635)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: make sure ptp clock is unregister and freed if hclge_ptp_get_cycle returns an error\n\nDuring the initialization of ptp, hclge_ptp_get_cycle might return an error\nand returned directly without unregister clock and free it. To avoid that,\ncall hclge_ptp_destroy_clock to unregist and free clock if\nhclge_ptp_get_cycle failed.(CVE-2025-21924)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: appleir: Fix potential NULL dereference at raw event handle\n\nSyzkaller reports a NULL pointer dereference issue in input_event().\n\nBUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in instrument_atomic_read include/linux/instrumented.h:68 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in _test_bit include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-non-atomic.h:141 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in is_event_supported drivers/input/input.c:67 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in input_event+0x42/0xa0 drivers/input/input.c:395\nRead of size 8 at addr 0000000000000028 by task syz-executor199/2949\n\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 2949 Comm: syz-executor199 Not tainted 6.13.0-rc4-syzkaller-00076-gf097a36ef88d #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n kasan_report+0xd9/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:602\n check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline]\n kasan_check_range+0xef/0x1a0 mm/kasan/generic.c:189\n instrument_atomic_read include/linux/instrumented.h:68 [inline]\n _test_bit include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-non-atomic.h:141 [inline]\n is_event_supported drivers/input/input.c:67 [inline]\n input_event+0x42/0xa0 drivers/input/input.c:395\n input_report_key include/linux/input.h:439 [inline]\n key_down drivers/hid/hid-appleir.c:159 [inline]\n appleir_raw_event+0x3e5/0x5e0 drivers/hid/hid-appleir.c:232\n __hid_input_report.constprop.0+0x312/0x440 drivers/hid/hid-core.c:2111\n hid_ctrl+0x49f/0x550 drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:484\n __usb_hcd_giveback_urb+0x389/0x6e0 drivers/usb/core/hcd.c:1650\n usb_hcd_giveback_urb+0x396/0x450 drivers/usb/core/hcd.c:1734\n dummy_timer+0x17f7/0x3960 drivers/usb/gadget/udc/dummy_hcd.c:1993\n __run_hrtimer kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1739 [inline]\n __hrtimer_run_queues+0x20a/0xae0 kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1803\n hrtimer_run_softirq+0x17d/0x350 kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1820\n handle_softirqs+0x206/0x8d0 kernel/softirq.c:561\n __do_softirq kernel/softirq.c:595 [inline]\n invoke_softirq kernel/softirq.c:435 [inline]\n __irq_exit_rcu+0xfa/0x160 kernel/softirq.c:662\n irq_exit_rcu+0x9/0x30 kernel/softirq.c:678\n instr_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1049 [inline]\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x90/0xb0 arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1049\n \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x1a/0x20 arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:702\n __mod_timer+0x8f6/0xdc0 kernel/time/timer.c:1185\n add_timer+0x62/0x90 kernel/time/timer.c:1295\n schedule_timeout+0x11f/0x280 kernel/time/sleep_timeout.c:98\n usbhid_wait_io+0x1c7/0x380 drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:645\n usbhid_init_reports+0x19f/0x390 drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c:784\n hiddev_ioctl+0x1133/0x15b0 drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c:794\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:906 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:892 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x190/0x200 fs/ioctl.c:892\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xcd/0x250 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nThis happens due to the malformed report items sent by the emulated device\nwhich results in a report, that has no fields, being added to the report list.\nDue to this appleir_input_configured() is never called, hidinput_connect()\nfails which results in the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag is not being set. However,\nit  does not make appleir_probe() fail and lets the event callback to be\ncalled without the associated input device.\n\nThus, add a check for the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag and leave the event hook\nearly if the driver didn't claim any input_dev for some reason. Moreover,\nsome other hid drivers accessing input_dev in their event callbacks do have\nsimilar checks, too.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.(CVE-2025-21948)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla1280: Fix kernel oops when debug level \u003e 2\n\nA null dereference or oops exception will eventually occur when qla1280.c\ndriver is compiled with DEBUG_QLA1280 enabled and ql_debug_level \u003e 2.  I\nthink its clear from the code that the intention here is sg_dma_len(s) not\nlength of sg_next(s) when printing the debug info.(CVE-2025-21957)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy\n\nA wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated and\ninitialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the\nrdev::wiphy_work is getting queued.\n\nIf wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,\nthe wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run\nit'll use invalid memory.\n\nFix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.(CVE-2025-21979)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hns: Fix soft lockup during bt pages loop\n\nDriver runs a for-loop when allocating bt pages and mapping them with\nbuffer pages. When a large buffer (e.g. MR over 100GB) is being allocated,\nit may require a considerable loop count. This will lead to soft lockup:\n\n        watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#27 stuck for 22s!\n        ...\n        Call trace:\n         hem_list_alloc_mid_bt+0x124/0x394 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_hem_list_request+0xf8/0x160 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_mtr_create+0x2e4/0x360 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         alloc_mr_pbl+0xd4/0x17c [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_reg_user_mr+0xf8/0x190 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         ib_uverbs_reg_mr+0x118/0x290\n\n        watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#35 stuck for 23s!\n        ...\n        Call trace:\n         hns_roce_hem_list_find_mtt+0x7c/0xb0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         mtr_map_bufs+0xc4/0x204 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_mtr_create+0x31c/0x3c4 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         alloc_mr_pbl+0xb0/0x160 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_reg_user_mr+0x108/0x1c0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         ib_uverbs_reg_mr+0x120/0x2bc\n\nAdd a cond_resched() to fix soft lockup during these loops. In order not\nto affect the allocation performance of normal-size buffer, set the loop\ncount of a 100GB MR as the threshold to call cond_resched().(CVE-2025-22010)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlock\n\nWhen some client process A call pdr_add_lookup() to add the look up for\nthe service and does schedule locator work, later a process B got a new\nserver packet indicating locator is up and call pdr_locator_new_server()\nwhich eventually sets pdr-\u003elocator_init_complete to true which process A\nsees and takes list lock and queries domain list but it will timeout due\nto deadlock as the response will queued to the same qmi-\u003ewq and it is\nordered workqueue and process B is not able to complete new server\nrequest work due to deadlock on list lock.\n\nFix it by removing the unnecessary list iteration as the list iteration\nis already being done inside locator work, so avoid it here and just\ncall schedule_work() here.\n\n       Process A                        Process B\n\n                                     process_scheduled_works()\npdr_add_lookup()                      qmi_data_ready_work()\n process_scheduled_works()             pdr_locator_new_server()\n                                         pdr-\u003elocator_init_complete=true;\n   pdr_locator_work()\n    mutex_lock(\u0026pdr-\u003elist_lock);\n\n     pdr_locate_service()                  mutex_lock(\u0026pdr-\u003elist_lock);\n\n      pdr_get_domain_list()\n       pr_err(\"PDR: %s get domain list\n               txn wait failed: %d\\n\",\n               req-\u003eservice_name,\n               ret);\n\nTimeout error log due to deadlock:\n\n\"\n PDR: tms/servreg get domain list txn wait failed: -110\n PDR: service lookup for msm/adsp/sensor_pd:tms/servreg failed: -110\n\"\n\nThanks to Bjorn and Johan for letting me know that this commit also fixes\nan audio regression when using the in-kernel pd-mapper as that makes it\neasier to hit this race. [1](CVE-2025-22014)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/migrate: fix shmem xarray update during migration\n\nA shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the\nsame time.  Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio-\u003emapping should be\nNULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.\n\nIn __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to\nupdate, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page\ncache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index\nentry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during\nxas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using\nfolio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache\nentries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Z8idPCkaJW1IChjT@casper.infradead.org/\n\nNote:\nIn __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() \u0026\u0026 folio_test_swapcache() is\nused to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in\nswap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a\nin-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since\n!folio_test_anon() is true and folio-\u003emapping is NULL.  But fortunately,\nits caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY\nwhen folio-\u003emapping is NULL.  So no need to take care of it here.(CVE-2025-22015)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: streamzap: fix race between device disconnection and urb callback\n\nSyzkaller has reported a general protection fault at function\nir_raw_event_store_with_filter(). This crash is caused by a NULL pointer\ndereference of dev-\u003eraw pointer, even though it is checked for NULL in\nthe same function, which means there is a race condition. It occurs due\nto the incorrect order of actions in the streamzap_disconnect() function:\nrc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb(). The dev-\u003eraw\npointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and only\nafter that usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.\n\nIf rc_unregister_device() is called while streamzap_callback() handler is\nnot finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources. Thus\nrc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.(CVE-2025-22027)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix session use-after-free in multichannel connection\n\nThere is a race condition between session setup and\nksmbd_sessions_deregister. The session can be freed before the connection\nis added to channel list of session.\nThis patch check reference count of session before freeing it.(CVE-2025-22040)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix use-after-free in ksmbd_sessions_deregister()\n\nIn multichannel mode, UAF issue can occur in session_deregister\nwhen the second channel sets up a session through the connection of\nthe first channel. session that is freed through the global session\ntable can be accessed again through -\u003esessions of connection.(CVE-2025-22041)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nacpi: nfit: fix narrowing conversion in acpi_nfit_ctl\n\nSyzkaller has reported a warning in to_nfit_bus_uuid(): \"only secondary\nbus families can be translated\". This warning is emited if the argument\nis equal to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_NFIT == 0. Function acpi_nfit_ctl() first\nverifies that a user-provided value call_pkg-\u003end_family of type u64 is\nnot equal to 0. Then the value is converted to int, and only after that\nis compared to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_MAX. This can lead to passing an invalid\nargument to acpi_nfit_ctl(), if call_pkg-\u003end_family is non-zero, while\nthe lower 32 bits are zero.\n\nFurthermore, it is best to return EINVAL immediately upon seeing the\ninvalid user input.  The WARNING is insufficient to prevent further\nundefined behavior based on other invalid user input.\n\nAll checks of the input value should be applied to the original variable\ncall_pkg-\u003end_family.\n\n[iweiny: update commit message](CVE-2025-22044)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm: Fix flush_tlb_range() when used for zapping normal PMDs\n\nOn the following path, flush_tlb_range() can be used for zapping normal\nPMD entries (PMD entries that point to page tables) together with the PTE\nentries in the pointed-to page table:\n\n    collapse_pte_mapped_thp\n      pmdp_collapse_flush\n        flush_tlb_range\n\nThe arm64 version of flush_tlb_range() has a comment describing that it can\nbe used for page table removal, and does not use any last-level\ninvalidation optimizations. Fix the X86 version by making it behave the\nsame way.\n\nCurrently, X86 only uses this information for the following two purposes,\nwhich I think means the issue doesn't have much impact:\n\n - In native_flush_tlb_multi() for checking if lazy TLB CPUs need to be\n   IPI'd to avoid issues with speculative page table walks.\n - In Hyper-V TLB paravirtualization, again for lazy TLB stuff.\n\nThe patch \"x86/mm: only invalidate final translations with INVLPGB\" which\nis currently under review (see\n\u003chttps://lore.kernel.org/all/20241230175550.4046587-13-riel@surriel.com/\u003e)\nwould probably be making the impact of this a lot worse.(CVE-2025-22045)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nLoongArch: BPF: Don't override subprog's return value\n\nThe verifier test `calls: div by 0 in subprog` triggers a panic at the\nld.bu instruction. The ld.bu insn is trying to load byte from memory\naddress returned by the subprog. The subprog actually set the correct\naddress at the a5 register (dedicated register for BPF return values).\nBut at commit 73c359d1d356 (\"LoongArch: BPF: Sign-extend return values\")\nwe also sign extended a5 to the a0 register (return value in LoongArch).\nFor function call insn, we later propagate the a0 register back to a5\nregister. This is right for native calls but wrong for bpf2bpf calls\nwhich expect zero-extended return value in a5 register. So only move a0\nto a5 for native calls (i.e. non-BPF_PSEUDO_CALL).(CVE-2025-22048)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspufs: fix gang directory lifetimes\n\nprior to \"[POWERPC] spufs: Fix gang destroy leaks\" we used to have\na problem with gang lifetimes - creation of a gang returns opened\ngang directory, which normally gets removed when that gets closed,\nbut if somebody has created a context belonging to that gang and\nkept it alive until the gang got closed, removal failed and we\nended up with a leak.\n\nUnfortunately, it had been fixed the wrong way.  Dentry of gang\ndirectory was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone.\nOne problem was that failure of open kept calling simple_rmdir()\nas cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug was\nin the success case - gang creation incremented link count on\nroot directory, but that was no longer undone when gang got\ndestroyed.\n\nFix consists of\n\t* reverting the commit in question\n\t* adding a counter to gang, protected by -\u003ei_rwsem\nof gang directory inode.\n\t* having it set to 1 at creation time, dropped\nin both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and bumped\nin spufs_create_context(), provided that it's not 0.\n\t* using simple_recursive_removal() to take the gang\ndirectory out when counter reaches zero.(CVE-2025-22072)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: brcmstb: Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()\n\nIf the regulator_bulk_get() returns an error and no regulators\nare created, we need to set their number to zero.\n\nIf we don't do this and the PCIe link up fails, a call to the\nregulator_bulk_free() will result in a kernel panic.\n\nWhile at it, print the error value, as we cannot return an error\nupwards as the kernel will WARN() on an error from add_bus().\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, use comma in the message to match style with\nother similar messages](CVE-2025-22095)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: avoid journaling sb update on error if journal is destroying\n\nPresently we always BUG_ON if trying to start a transaction on a journal marked\nwith JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However, while ltp running\nstress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is\npossible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is\ndestroyed eg:\n\n(umount)\next4_kill_sb\n  kill_block_super\n    generic_shutdown_super\n      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */\n      evict_inodes\n        /* might start a new txn */\n      ext4_put_super\n\tflush_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */\n        jbd2_journal_destroy\n          journal_kill_thread\n            journal-\u003ej_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;\n          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction\n            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer\n              jbd2_journal_bmap\n                ext4_journal_bmap\n                  ext4_map_blocks\n                    ...\n                    ext4_inode_error\n                      ext4_handle_error\n                        schedule_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work)\n\n                                               /* work queue kicks in */\n                                               update_super_work\n                                                 jbd2_journal_start\n                                                   start_this_handle\n                                                     BUG_ON(journal-\u003ej_flags \u0026\n                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)\n\nHence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do\na journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just\nfallback to an un-journaled commit.\n\nFurther, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:\n\n  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.(CVE-2025-22113)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix out-of-bound read in ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all()\n\nThere's issue as follows:\nBUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all+0x6ff/0x790\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff88807b003000 by task syz-executor.0/15172\n\nCPU: 3 PID: 15172 Comm: syz-executor.0\nCall Trace:\n __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:82 [inline]\n dump_stack+0xbe/0xfd lib/dump_stack.c:123\n print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1e/0x280 mm/kasan/report.c:400\n __kasan_report.cold+0x6c/0x84 mm/kasan/report.c:560\n kasan_report+0x3a/0x50 mm/kasan/report.c:585\n ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all+0x6ff/0x790 fs/ext4/xattr.c:1137\n ext4_xattr_delete_inode+0x4c7/0xda0 fs/ext4/xattr.c:2896\n ext4_evict_inode+0xb3b/0x1670 fs/ext4/inode.c:323\n evict+0x39f/0x880 fs/inode.c:622\n iput_final fs/inode.c:1746 [inline]\n iput fs/inode.c:1772 [inline]\n iput+0x525/0x6c0 fs/inode.c:1758\n ext4_orphan_cleanup fs/ext4/super.c:3298 [inline]\n ext4_fill_super+0x8c57/0xba40 fs/ext4/super.c:5300\n mount_bdev+0x355/0x410 fs/super.c:1446\n legacy_get_tree+0xfe/0x220 fs/fs_context.c:611\n vfs_get_tree+0x8d/0x2f0 fs/super.c:1576\n do_new_mount fs/namespace.c:2983 [inline]\n path_mount+0x119a/0x1ad0 fs/namespace.c:3316\n do_mount+0xfc/0x110 fs/namespace.c:3329\n __do_sys_mount fs/namespace.c:3540 [inline]\n __se_sys_mount+0x219/0x2e0 fs/namespace.c:3514\n do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40 arch/x86/entry/common.c:46\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x67/0xd1\n\nMemory state around the buggy address:\n ffff88807b002f00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n ffff88807b002f80: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\u003effff88807b003000: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff\n                   ^\n ffff88807b003080: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff\n ffff88807b003100: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff\n\nAbove issue happens as ext4_xattr_delete_inode() isn't check xattr\nis valid if xattr is in inode.\nTo solve above issue call xattr_check_inode() check if xattr if valid\nin inode. In fact, we can directly verify in ext4_iget_extra_inode(),\nso that there is no divergent verification.(CVE-2025-22121)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flags\n\nIf blk-wbt is enabled by default, it's found that raid write performance\nis quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks,\ndue to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored.

With BPF progs\nmixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls, build_prologue() generates N insns in the\nfirst pass and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass. This makes\nepilogue_offset off by one and we will jump to some unexpected insn and\ncause lockup. Fix this by inserting a nop insn.(CVE-2025-37893)",

If function 0 is removed before sibling function,\nlink-\u003edownstream would point to free'd memory after.\n\nAfter above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function\nremoval on the bus pertaining to a given link.\n\nThat is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream\nport, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which\nstill remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.\n\nThe resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because\npciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.\n\nOn that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.\nFree exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is\nobsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log]",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: avoid journaling sb update on error if journal is destroying\n\nPresently we always BUG_ON if trying to start a transaction on a journal marked\nwith JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However, while ltp running\nstress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is\npossible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is\ndestroyed eg:\n\n(umount)\next4_kill_sb\n  kill_block_super\n    generic_shutdown_super\n      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */\n      evict_inodes\n        /* might start a new txn */\n      ext4_put_super\n\tflush_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */\n        jbd2_journal_destroy\n          journal_kill_thread\n            journal-\u003ej_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;\n          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction\n            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer\n              jbd2_journal_bmap\n                ext4_journal_bmap\n                  ext4_map_blocks\n                    ...\n                    ext4_inode_error\n                      ext4_handle_error\n                        schedule_work(\u0026sbi-\u003es_sb_upd_work)\n\n                                               /* work queue kicks in */\n                                               update_super_work\n                                                 jbd2_journal_start\n                                                   start_this_handle\n                                                     BUG_ON(journal-\u003ej_flags \u0026\n                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)\n\nHence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do\na journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just\nfallback to an un-journaled commit.\n\nFurther, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:\n\n  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.",
