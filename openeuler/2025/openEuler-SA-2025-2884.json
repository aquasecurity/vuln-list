Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring\nsegment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was\nreceived when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:\n\n[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0\n[ 1.042120] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000]\n[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]\n\nIt gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to\nthe HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a\nzero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in\npage at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.\n\n[ 7.041671] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0\n[ 7.041999] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0\n[ 7.042011] xhci_hcd: WARN: buffer overrun event for slot 1 ep 2 on endpoint\n[ 7.042028] xhci_hcd: All TDs skipped for slot 1 ep 2.

Was it\ncaused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk\nwas working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to\nstarve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs\nshared one x1 slot by means of a commercial \"PCIe splitter\" board.\n\n[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd\n[ 7.178990] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 UNKNOWN(0x2003) Result: hostbyte=0x07 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK cmd_age=0s\n[ 7.179001] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: opcode=0x28 28 00 04 02 ae 00 00 02 00 00\n[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0\n\nFortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting\nthe chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are\nknown which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if\nit's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.\n\nThe bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports\ntens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining\nLink TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.\n\nNo ne\n---truncated---(CVE-2025-22022)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix overflow in dacloffset bounds check\n\nThe dacloffset field was originally typed as int and used in an\nunchecked addition, which could overflow and bypass the existing\nbounds check in both smb_check_perm_dacl() and smb_inherit_dacl().\n\nThis could result in out-of-bounds memory access and a kernel crash\nwhen dereferencing the DACL pointer.\n\nThis patch converts dacloffset to unsigned int and uses\ncheck_add_overflow() to validate access to the DACL.(CVE-2025-22039)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:backlight: led_bl: Hold led_access lock when calling led_sysfs_disable()Lockdep detects the following issue on led-backlight removal:  [  142.315935] ------------[ cut here ]------------  [  142.315954] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 292 at drivers/leds/led-core.c:455 led_sysfs_enable+0x54/0x80  ...

Add missing check in the kb3930_probe().\nThis is similar to the issue fixed in commit b1ba8bcb2d1f\n(\"backlight: hx8357: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference\").\n\nThis was detected by our static analysis tool.(CVE-2025-23146)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: hfi: add check to handle incorrect queue size\n\nqsize represents size of shared queued between driver and video\nfirmware. Firmware can modify this value to an invalid large value. In\nsuch situation, empty_space will be bigger than the space actually\navailable. Since new_wr_idx is not checked, so the following code will\nresult in an OOB write.\n...\nqsize = qhdr-\u003eq_size\n\nif (wr_idx \u003e= rd_idx)\n empty_space = qsize - (wr_idx - rd_idx)\n....\nif (new_wr_idx \u003c qsize) {\n memcpy(wr_ptr, packet, dwords \u003c\u003c 2) --\u003e OOB write\n\nAdd check to ensure qsize is within the allocated size while\nreading and writing packets into the queue.(CVE-2025-23158)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mediatek: vcodec: Fix a resource leak related to the scp device in FW initialization\n\nOn Mediatek devices with a system companion processor (SCP) the mtk_scp\nstructure has to be removed explicitly to avoid a resource leak.\nFree the structure in case the allocation of the firmware structure fails\nduring the firmware initialization.(CVE-2025-23160)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tls: explicitly disallow disconnect\n\nsyzbot discovered that it can disconnect a TLS socket and then\nrun into all sort of unexpected corner cases. I have a vague\nrecollection of Eric pointing this out to us a long time ago.\nSupporting disconnect is really hard, for one thing if offload\nis enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.\nDisconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.\n\nThe immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,\nbut that's just the easiest bug to trigger:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5834 at net/tls/tls_strp.c:486 tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486\n  RIP: 0010:tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   tls_rx_rec_wait+0x280/0xa60 net/tls/tls_sw.c:1363\n   tls_sw_recvmsg+0x85c/0x1c30 net/tls/tls_sw.c:2043\n   inet6_recvmsg+0x2c9/0x730 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:678\n   sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1023 [inline]\n   sock_recvmsg+0x109/0x280 net/socket.c:1045\n   __sys_recvfrom+0x202/0x380 net/socket.c:2237(CVE-2025-37756)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix the warning from __kernel_write_iter\n\n[ 2110.972290] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[ 2110.972301] WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 735 at fs/read_write.c:599 __kernel_write_iter+0x21b/0x280\n\nThis patch doesn't allow writing to directory.(CVE-2025-37775)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix use-after-free in smb_break_all_levII_oplock()\n\nThere is a room in smb_break_all_levII_oplock that can cause racy issues\nwhen unlocking in the middle of the loop. This patch use read lock\nto protect whole loop.(CVE-2025-37776)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer\n\nThe XOL (execute out-of-line) buffer is used to single-step the\nreplaced instruction(s) for uprobes. The RISC-V port was missing a\nproper fence.i (i$ flushing) after constructing the XOL buffer, which\ncan result in incorrect execution of stale/broken instructions.\n\nThis was found running the BPF selftests \"test_progs:\nuprobe_autoattach, attach_probe\" on the Spacemit K1/X60, where the\nuprobes tests randomly blew up.(CVE-2025-37822)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npwm: mediatek: Prevent divide-by-zero in pwm_mediatek_config()\n\nWith CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST \u0026\u0026 !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, pwm_mediatek_config() has a\ndivide-by-zero in the following line:\n\n\tdo_div(resolution, clk_get_rate(pc-\u003eclk_pwms[pwm-\u003ehwpwm]));\n\ndue to the fact that the !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK version of clk_get_rate()\nreturns zero.\n\nThis is presumably just a theoretical problem: COMPILE_TEST overrides\nthe dependency on RALINK which would select COMMON_CLK.  Regardless it's\na good idea to check for the error explicitly to avoid divide-by-zero.\n\nFixes the following warning:\n\n  drivers/pwm/pwm-mediatek.o: warning: objtool: .text: unexpected end of section\n\n[ukleinek: s/CONFIG_CLK/CONFIG_HAVE_CLK/](CVE-2025-37850)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/amd: Fix potential buffer overflow in parse_ivrs_acpihid\n\nThere is a string parsing logic error which can lead to an overflow of hid\nor uid buffers. Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn't\ntake into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the\ncheck is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid\nstring is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str\nwill be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer\nwhich size is 256.\n\nThe same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with\nlength 250.\n\nCheck the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent\nbuffer overflow.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.(CVE-2025-37927)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Fix ECVF vports unload on shutdown flow\n\nFix shutdown flow UAF when a virtual function is created on the embedded\nchip (ECVF) of a BlueField device.

Assuming this mechanism is in place, the WARN check in\nkernfs_should_drain_open_files() is too sensitive -- it may transiently\ncatch those (rightful) callers between\nkernfs_unbreak_active_protection() and kernfs_put_active() as found out by Chen\nRidong:\n\n\tkernfs_remove_by_name_ns\tkernfs_get_active // active=1\n\t__kernfs_remove\t\t\t\t\t  // active=0x80000002\n\tkernfs_drain\t\t\t...\n\twait_event\n\t//waiting (active == 0x80000001)\n\t\t\t\t\tkernfs_break_active_protection\n\t\t\t\t\t// active = 0x80000001\n\t// continue\n\t\t\t\t\tkernfs_unbreak_active_protection\n\t\t\t\t\t// active = 0x80000002\n\t...\n\tkernfs_should_drain_open_files\n\t// warning occurs\n\t\t\t\t\tkernfs_put_active\n\nTo avoid the false positives (mind panic_on_warn) remove the check altogether.\n(This is meant as quick fix, I think active reference break/unbreak may be\nsimplified with larger rework.)(CVE-2025-38282)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Check dce_hwseq before dereferencing it\n\n[WHAT]\n\nhws was checked for null earlier in dce110_blank_stream, indicating hws\ncan be null, and should be checked whenever it is used.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 79db43611ff61280b6de58ce1305e0b2ecf675ad)(CVE-2025-38361)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/sev: Evict cache lines during SNP memory validation\n\nAn SNP cache coherency vulnerability requires a cache line eviction\nmitigation when validating memory after a page state change to private.\nThe specific mitigation is to touch the first and last byte of each 4K\npage that is being validated. There is no need to perform the mitigation\nwhen performing a page state change to shared and rescinding validation.\n\nCPUID bit Fn8000001F_EBX[31] defines the COHERENCY_SFW_NO CPUID bit\nthat, when set, indicates that the software mitigation for this\nvulnerability is not needed.\n\nImplement the mitigation and invoke it when validating memory (making it\nprivate) and the COHERENCY_SFW_NO bit is not set, indicating the SNP\nguest is vulnerable.(CVE-2025-38560)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()\n\nWhile testing prior patch, I was able to trigger\nan infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:\n\nlist_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, \u0026f6i-\u003efib6_siblings,\n\t\t\tfib6_siblings) {\n\trt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling-\u003efib6_nh, \u0026nexthop_len);\n}\n\nThis is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()\nuses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,\nbecause they might no longer see the head of the list.\n\nRestart the loop if f6i-\u003efib6_nsiblings is zero.(CVE-2025-38588)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion\n\nEnsure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than\nEP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.\n\nCurrently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and\ndoes some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't\nlimit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:\n\n - They don't look upwards in the tree.\n - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of\n   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit\n   28d82dc1c4ed (\"epoll: limit paths\").\n\nEssentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just\nserves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.\n\nA more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph\nedge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no\npaths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5\nedges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.\n\nAs a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,\ntested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may\nhave changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 (\"eventpoll: Fix priority inversion\nproblem\").)\n\nTo fix it:\n\n1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,\nand use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree\nhas already been visited.\n2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum\ndepth of an upwards walk.\n3.

A kernel\nbuffer is allocated to hold `insn-\u003en` samples (each of which is an\n`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn-\u003en` samples are\ncopied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The\nproblem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return\ndata to userspace fill in the whole `insn-\u003en` samples, so that there is\nan information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at\nthe time of writing.\n\nOne culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have\na specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`\nhandler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if\n`insn-\u003en` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn-\u003en - 1` samples copied\nto userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.\n\nAnother culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the \"vm80xx\" driver.  It\nnever returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.\n\nFix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure\nthat uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before\nhandling each instruction.\n\nThanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix\nreplaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not\nalways necessary to clear the whole buffer.(CVE-2025-39684)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write\n\nAfter nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is\nstill attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to\nnfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the\npage group.\nThe reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't\nnecessarily have a lock on the page group head.\n\nSo in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in\nnfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the\nrequest in nfs_inode_remove_request().(CVE-2025-39697)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: fix race with concurrent opens in rename(2)\n\nBesides sending the rename request to the server, the rename process\nalso involves closing any deferred close, waiting for outstanding I/O\nto complete as well as marking all existing open handles as deleted to\nprevent them from deferring closes, which increases the race window\nfor potential concurrent opens on the target file.\n\nFix this by unhashing the dentry in advance to prevent any concurrent\nopens on the target.(CVE-2025-39825)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernfs: Fix UAF in polling when open file is released\n\nA use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability was identified in the PSI (Pressure\nStall Information) monitoring mechanism:\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in psi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff3de3d50bd308 by task systemd/1\n\npsi_trigger_poll+0x3c/0x140\ncgroup_pressure_poll+0x70/0xa0\ncgroup_file_poll+0x8c/0x100\nkernfs_fop_poll+0x11c/0x1c0\nep_item_poll.isra.0+0x188/0x2c0\n\nAllocated by task 1:\ncgroup_file_open+0x88/0x388\nkernfs_fop_open+0x73c/0xaf0\ndo_dentry_open+0x5fc/0x1200\nvfs_open+0xa0/0x3f0\ndo_open+0x7e8/0xd08\npath_openat+0x2fc/0x6b0\ndo_filp_open+0x174/0x368\n\nFreed by task 8462:\ncgroup_file_release+0x130/0x1f8\nkernfs_drain_open_files+0x17c/0x440\nkernfs_drain+0x2dc/0x360\nkernfs_show+0x1b8/0x288\ncgroup_file_show+0x150/0x268\ncgroup_pressure_write+0x1dc/0x340\ncgroup_file_write+0x274/0x548\n\nReproduction Steps:\n1.

They both use a static\n256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of\nthe 'command' file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes\nspace. In the case of the 'netdev_ops' file, the last command written is\nsaved here.\n\nOn read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device\nfollowed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static\nbuffer. For 'command' this will always be \"\u003cdevice\u003e: \". For 'netdev_ops',\nthis will be \"\u003cdevice\u003e: \u003clast command written\u003e\". But note the buffer is\nshared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly\nmeaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously\nas there doesn't appear to be any locking mechanism.\n\nWe have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions\nabout their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in\nreading arbitrary kernel memory. For the 'command' file, this is definitely\nimpossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.\nFor the 'netdev_ops' file, it does appear to be possible, if the user\ncarefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,\nwhich could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then\ncauses the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated\nby kzalloc.\n\nA minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would\ncap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A\nmore involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,\nsaving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as\ninput.\n\nInstead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These\nare debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don't believe that\ndropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is\npretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard\ninterfaces, and the 'netdev_ops' interface can easily result in garbage if\nyou issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.\n\nIn order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to\nrefactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use\nthe same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.\nUpdate the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we\nfree the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to 'netdev_ops' on\nmultiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer\nalong with removing the read access.(CVE-2025-39901)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: smbdirect: verify remaining_data_length respects max_fragmented_recv_size\n\nThis is inspired by the check for data_offset + data_length.(CVE-2025-39942)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/ksm: fix flag-dropping behavior in ksm_madvise\n\nsyzkaller discovered the following crash: (kernel BUG)\n\n[   44.607039] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   44.607422] kernel BUG at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067!\n[   44.608148] Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC KASAN NOPTI\n[   44.608814] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 2475 Comm: reproducer Not tainted 6.16.0-rc6 #1 PREEMPT(none)\n[   44.609635] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[   44.610695] RIP: 0010:userfaultfd_release_all+0x3a8/0x460\n\n\u003csnip other registers, drop unreliable trace\u003e\n\n[   44.617726] Call Trace:\n[   44.617926]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[   44.619284]  userfaultfd_release+0xef/0x1b0\n[   44.620976]  __fput+0x3f9/0xb60\n[   44.621240]  fput_close_sync+0x110/0x210\n[   44.622222]  __x64_sys_close+0x8f/0x120\n[   44.622530]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x2f0\n[   44.622840]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[   44.623244] RIP: 0033:0x7f365bb3f227\n\nKernel panics because it detects UFFD inconsistency during\nuserfaultfd_release_all().

This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n\u0026 operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[(CVE-2025-40040)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSquashfs: fix uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent\n\nSyzkaller reports a \"KMSAN: uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent\" bug.\n\nThis is caused by open_by_handle_at() being called with a file handle\ncontaining an invalid parent inode number.

Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring\nsegment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was\nreceived when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:\n\n[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0\n[ 1.042120] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000]\n[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]\n\nIt gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to\nthe HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a\nzero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in\npage at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.\n\n[ 7.041671] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0\n[ 7.041999] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0\n[ 7.042011] xhci_hcd: WARN: buffer overrun event for slot 1 ep 2 on endpoint\n[ 7.042028] xhci_hcd: All TDs skipped for slot 1 ep 2.

Was it\ncaused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk\nwas working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to\nstarve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs\nshared one x1 slot by means of a commercial \"PCIe splitter\" board.\n\n[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd\n[ 7.178990] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 UNKNOWN(0x2003) Result: hostbyte=0x07 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK cmd_age=0s\n[ 7.179001] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: opcode=0x28 28 00 04 02 ae 00 00 02 00 00\n[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0\n\nFortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting\nthe chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are\nknown which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if\nit's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.\n\nThe bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports\ntens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds.

However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.\n\nAs a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,\ntested on v6.15.

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: remove read access to debugfs files\n\nThe 'command' and 'netdev_ops' debugfs files are a legacy debugging\ninterface supported by the i40e driver since its early days by commit\n02e9c290814c (\"i40e: debugfs interface\").\n\nBoth of these debugfs files provide a read handler which is mostly useless,\nand which is implemented with questionable logic. They both use a static\n256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of\nthe 'command' file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes\nspace. In the case of the 'netdev_ops' file, the last command written is\nsaved here.\n\nOn read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device\nfollowed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static\nbuffer. For 'command' this will always be \"\u003cdevice\u003e: \". For 'netdev_ops',\nthis will be \"\u003cdevice\u003e: \u003clast command written\u003e\". But note the buffer is\nshared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly\nmeaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously\nas there doesn't appear to be any locking mechanism.\n\nWe have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions\nabout their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in\nreading arbitrary kernel memory. For the 'command' file, this is definitely\nimpossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.\nFor the 'netdev_ops' file, it does appear to be possible, if the user\ncarefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,\nwhich could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then\ncauses the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated\nby kzalloc.\n\nA minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would\ncap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A\nmore involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,\nsaving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as\ninput.\n\nInstead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These\nare debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don't believe that\ndropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is\npretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard\ninterfaces, and the 'netdev_ops' interface can easily result in garbage if\nyou issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.\n\nIn order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to\nrefactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use\nthe same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.\nUpdate the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we\nfree the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to 'netdev_ops' on\nmultiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer\nalong with removing the read access.",

Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer\nto vma-\u003evm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma-\u003evm_flags.\n\nThe inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()\nwith MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,\nit accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of\nvma-\u003evm_flags.\n\nAssuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and\nint are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the \u0026=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the \u0026 operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n\u0026 operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[",
