      "Text": "Cobbler is a network install server. Cobbler supports PXE, ISO virtualized installs, and re-installing existing Linux machines. The last two modes use a helper tool, \u0026apos;koan\u0026apos;, that integrates with cobbler. Cobbler\u0026apos;s advanced features include importing distributions from DVDs and rsync mirrors, kickstart templating, integrated yum mirroring, and built-in DHCP/DNS Management. Cobbler has a XML-RPC API for integration with other applications.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nCobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments, has an improper authentication vulnerability starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7. `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows anyone to connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `''` password `-1` and make any changes. This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.(CVE-2024-47533)",
