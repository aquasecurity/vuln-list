      "Text": "The Linux Kernel, the operating system core itself.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix potencial out-of-bounds when buffer offset is invalid\n\nI found potencial out-of-bounds when buffer offset fields of a few requests\nis invalid. This patch set the minimum value of buffer offset field to\n-\u003eBuffer offset to validate buffer length.(CVE-2024-26952)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb_strndup_from_utf16()\n\nIf -\u003eNameOffset of smb2_create_req is smaller than Buffer offset of\nsmb2_create_req, slab-out-of-bounds read can happen from smb2_open.\nThis patch set the minimum value of the name offset to the buffer offset\nto validate name length of smb2_create_req().(CVE-2024-26954)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcount\n\nThe current implementation of the fpga bridge assumes that the low-level\nmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer\nto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can\nlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the bridge if\nthe parent device does not have a driver.\n\nTo address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_bridge\nstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the function for\nregistering a bridge to take an additional owner module parameter and\nrename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for a helper macro\nthat automatically sets the module that registers the bridge as the owner.\nThis ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and\nreduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting the owner.\n\nAlso, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface\nfor registering an fpga bridge.\n\nOther changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get()\nto fpga_bridge_get() and of_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity since\nthe bridge device is taken in these functions.(CVE-2024-36479)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iocost: avoid out of bounds shift\n\nUBSAN catches undefined behavior in blk-iocost, where sometimes\niocg-\u003edelay is shifted right by a number that is too large,\nresulting in undefined behavior on some architectures.\n\n[  186.556576] ------------[ cut here ]------------\nUBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1366:23\nshift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long')\nCPU: 16 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/16 Tainted: G S          E    N 6.9.0-0_fbk700_debug_rc2_kbuilder_0_gc85af715cac0 #1\nHardware name: Quanta Twin Lakes MP/Twin Lakes Passive MP, BIOS F09_3A23 12/08/2020\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x8f/0xe0\n __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x22c/0x280\n iocg_kick_delay+0x30b/0x310\n ioc_timer_fn+0x2fb/0x1f80\n __run_timer_base+0x1b6/0x250\n...\n\nAvoid that undefined behavior by simply taking the\n\"delay = 0\" branch if the shift is too large.\n\nI am not sure what the symptoms of an undefined value\ndelay will be, but I suspect it could be more than a\nlittle annoying to debug.(CVE-2024-36916)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfpga: manager: add owner module and take its refcount\n\nThe current implementation of the fpga manager assumes that the low-level\nmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer\nto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can\nlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the manager if\nthe parent device does not have a driver.\n\nTo address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_manager\nstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for\nregistering the manager to take an additional owner module parameter and\nrename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper\nmacros that automatically set the module that registers the manager as the\nowner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules\nand reduces the chances of registering a manager without setting the owner.\n\nAlso, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface\nfor registering an fpga manager.\n\nOther changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_mgr_get() to\nfpga_mgr_get() and of_fpga_mgr_get() to improve code clarity since the\nmanager device is taken in these functions.(CVE-2024-37021)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal/drivers/tsens: Fix null pointer dereference\n\ncompute_intercept_slope() is called from calibrate_8960() (in tsens-8960.c)\nas compute_intercept_slope(priv, p1, NULL, ONE_PT_CALIB) which lead to null\npointer dereference (if DEBUG or DYNAMIC_DEBUG set).\nFix this bug by adding null pointer check.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.(CVE-2024-38571)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: pcie: handle randbuf allocation failure\n\nThe kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return null\nif the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use\nget_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the\nnull pointer dereference bug will happen.\n\nIn order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separate\nfunction using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes in\nthe randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from overflow.(CVE-2024-38575)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntools/nolibc/stdlib: fix memory error in realloc()\n\nPass user_p_len to memcpy() instead of heap-\u003elen to prevent realloc()\nfrom copying an extra sizeof(heap) bytes from beyond the allocated\nregion.(CVE-2024-38585)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: stk1160: fix bounds checking in stk1160_copy_video()\n\nThe subtract in this condition is reversed.  The -\u003elength is the length\nof the buffer.  The -\u003ebytesused is how many bytes we have copied thus\nfar.  When the condition is reversed that means the result of the\nsubtraction is always negative but since it's unsigned then the result\nis a very high positive value.  That means the overflow check is never\ntrue.\n\nAdditionally, the -\u003ebytesused doesn't actually work for this purpose\nbecause we're not writing to \"buf-\u003emem + buf-\u003ebytesused\".  Instead, the\nmath to calculate the destination where we are writing is a bit\ninvolved.  You calculate the number of full lines already written,\nmultiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an odd\nnumbered line, and add the offset into the line.\n\nTo fix this buffer overflow, just take the actual destination where we\nare writing, if the offset is already out of bounds print an error and\nreturn.  Otherwise, write up to buf-\u003elength bytes.(CVE-2024-38621)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/vmalloc: fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAIL\n\ncommit a421ef303008 (\"mm: allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc\")\nincludes support for __GFP_NOFAIL, but it presents a conflict with commit\ndd544141b9eb (\"vmalloc: back off when the current task is OOM-killed\").  A\npossible scenario is as follows:\n\nprocess-a\n__vmalloc_node_range(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL)\n    __vmalloc_area_node()\n        vm_area_alloc_pages()\n\t\t--\u003e oom-killer send SIGKILL to process-a\n        if (fatal_signal_pending(current)) break;\n--\u003e return NULL;\n\nTo fix this, do not check fatal_signal_pending() in vm_area_alloc_pages()\nif __GFP_NOFAIL set.\n\nThis issue occurred during OPLUS KASAN TEST.

Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of\nsize MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized\niterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.\n\nThis patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splits\nthe iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and a\nbtree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-length\ndata array.(CVE-2024-39482)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngreybus: Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition.\n\nIn gb_interface_create, \u0026intf-\u003emode_switch_completion is bound with\ngb_interface_mode_switch_work.

This function will call kfree to free the object\n\"intf\". However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to\nrun after kfree, it may cause use-after-free error as\ngb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object \"intf\".\nThe possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows:\n\nCPU0                            CPU1\n\n                            |   gb_interface_create\n                            |   gb_interface_request_mode_switch\ngb_interface_release        |\nkfree(intf) (free)          |\n                            |   gb_interface_mode_switch_work\n                            |   mutex_lock(\u0026intf-\u003emutex) (use)\n\nFix it by canceling the work before kfree.(CVE-2024-39495)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/dpt: Make DPT object unshrinkable\n\nIn some scenarios, the DPT object gets shrunk but\nthe actual framebuffer did not and thus its still\nthere on the DPT's vm-\u003ebound_list.

This can result in a subsequent call\nto napi_get_frags returning a dangling pointer.\n\nFix this by clearing napi-\u003eskb before the skb is freed.(CVE-2024-40937)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: shmem: fix getting incorrect lruvec when replacing a shmem folio\n\nWhen testing shmem swapin, I encountered the warning below on my machine. \nThe reason is that replacing an old shmem folio with a new one causes\nmem_cgroup_migrate() to clear the old folio's memcg data.  As a result,\nthe old folio cannot get the correct memcg's lruvec needed to remove\nitself from the LRU list when it is being freed.  This could lead to\npossible serious problems, such as LRU list crashes due to holding the\nwrong LRU lock, and incorrect LRU statistics.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can fallback to use the mem_cgroup_replace_folio()\nto replace the old shmem folio.\n\n[ 5241.100311] page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:0x5d9960\n[ 5241.100317] head: order:4 mapcount:0 entire_mapcount:0 nr_pages_mapped:0 pincount:0\n[ 5241.100319] flags: 0x17fffe0000040068(uptodate|lru|head|swapbacked|node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x3ffff)\n[ 5241.100323] raw: 17fffe0000040068 fffffdffd6687948 fffffdffd69ae008 0000000000000000\n[ 5241.100325] raw: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000\n[ 5241.100326] head: 17fffe0000040068 fffffdffd6687948 fffffdffd69ae008 0000000000000000\n[ 5241.100327] head: 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000\n[ 5241.100328] head: 17fffe0000000204 fffffdffd6665801 ffffffffffffffff 0000000000000000\n[ 5241.100329] head: 0000000a00000010 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000\n[ 5241.100330] page dumped because: VM_WARN_ON_ONCE_FOLIO(!memcg \u0026\u0026 !mem_cgroup_disabled())\n[ 5241.100338] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[ 5241.100339] WARNING: CPU: 19 PID: 78402 at include/linux/memcontrol.h:775 folio_lruvec_lock_irqsave+0x140/0x150\n[...]\n[ 5241.100374] pc : folio_lruvec_lock_irqsave+0x140/0x150\n[ 5241.100375] lr : folio_lruvec_lock_irqsave+0x138/0x150\n[ 5241.100376] sp : ffff80008b38b930\n[...]\n[ 5241.100398] Call trace:\n[ 5241.100399]  folio_lruvec_lock_irqsave+0x140/0x150\n[ 5241.100401]  __page_cache_release+0x90/0x300\n[ 5241.100404]  __folio_put+0x50/0x108\n[ 5241.100406]  shmem_replace_folio+0x1b4/0x240\n[ 5241.100409]  shmem_swapin_folio+0x314/0x528\n[ 5241.100411]  shmem_get_folio_gfp+0x3b4/0x930\n[ 5241.100412]  shmem_fault+0x74/0x160\n[ 5241.100414]  __do_fault+0x40/0x218\n[ 5241.100417]  do_shared_fault+0x34/0x1b0\n[ 5241.100419]  do_fault+0x40/0x168\n[ 5241.100420]  handle_pte_fault+0x80/0x228\n[ 5241.100422]  __handle_mm_fault+0x1c4/0x440\n[ 5241.100424]  handle_mm_fault+0x60/0x1f0\n[ 5241.100426]  do_page_fault+0x120/0x488\n[ 5241.100429]  do_translation_fault+0x4c/0x68\n[ 5241.100431]  do_mem_abort+0x48/0xa0\n[ 5241.100434]  el0_da+0x38/0xc0\n[ 5241.100436]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0x68/0xc0\n[ 5241.100437]  el0t_64_sync+0x14c/0x150\n[ 5241.100439] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\n[baolin.wang@linux.alibaba.com: remove less helpful comments, per Matthew]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ccad3fe1375b468ebca3227b6b729f3eaf9d8046.1718423197.git.baolin.wang@linux.alibaba.com(CVE-2024-40949)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: prevent possible NULL deref in fib6_nh_init()\n\nsyzbot reminds us that in6_dev_get() can return NULL.\n\nfib6_nh_init()\n    ip6_validate_gw(  \u0026idev  )\n        ip6_route_check_nh(  idev  )\n            *idev = in6_dev_get(dev);

Either the link has failed and the system is in need\nof maintenance, or the link continues to work and user has been informed.\nThe message from the warning can be looked up in the sources.\n\nThis makes an actual link issue less verbose.\n\nFirst of all, this controller has a limitation in that the controller\ndriver has to assist the hardware with transition to L1 link state by\nwriting L1IATN to PMCTRL register, the L1 and L0 link state switching\nis not fully automatic on this controller.\n\nIn case of an ASMedia ASM1062 PCIe SATA controller which does not support\nASPM, on entry to suspend or during platform pm_test, the SATA controller\nenters D3hot state and the link enters L1 state. If the SATA controller\nwakes up before rcar_pcie_wakeup() was called and returns to D0, the link\nreturns to L0 before the controller driver even started its transition to\nL1 link state. At this point, the SATA controller did send an PM_ENTER_L1\nDLLP to the PCIe controller and the PCIe controller received it, and the\nPCIe controller did set PMSR PMEL1RX bit.\n\nOnce rcar_pcie_wakeup() is called, if the link is already back in L0 state\nand PMEL1RX bit is set, the controller driver has no way to determine if\nit should perform the link transition to L1 state, or treat the link as if\nit is in L0 state. Currently the driver attempts to perform the transition\nto L1 link state unconditionally, which in this specific case fails with a\nPMSR L1FAEG poll timeout, however the link still works as it is already\nback in L0 state.\n\nReduce this warning verbosity. In case the link is really broken, the\nrcar_pcie_config_access() would fail, otherwise it will succeed and any\nsystem with this controller and ASM1062 can suspend without generating\na backtrace.(CVE-2024-43876)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: pci: ivtv: Add check for DMA map result\n\nIn case DMA fails, 'dma-\u003eSG_length' is 0. This value is later used to\naccess 'dma-\u003eSGarray[dma-\u003eSG_length - 1]', which will cause out of\nbounds access.\n\nAdd check to return early on invalid value. Adjust warnings accordingly.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.(CVE-2024-43877)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warning\n\nACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM\n(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former can\ncontain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in each\nregion (i.e., tc chain) is limited.\n\nIn order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the device\nallows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in up\nto 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented using\ndst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on the\nnumber of masks being used (and therefore does not support mask\naggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.\n\nThe driver uses the \"objagg\" library to perform the mask aggregation by\npassing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether the\nfilter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters in\ndifferent TCAMs cannot share a mask.\n\nThe set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of the\nfilters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver will\nperiodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set (\"hints\") by\nlooking at all the existing objects.\n\nWhen the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregated\nthe driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /\nC-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is to\nmove as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbids\ntwo identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen if\none was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in the\nA-TCAM.\n\nThe above can result in the following set of hints:\n\nH1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -\u003e H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + delta\nH3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -\u003e H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + delta\n\nAfter getting the hints from the library the driver will start migrating\nfilters from one region to another while consulting the computed hints\nand instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions during\nthe transition.\n\nAssuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in the\nnew region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent of\nH1, the library will try to find the object associated with it and\ncreate it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)\nwill be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will either\nreturn H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparison\nfunction that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.\n\nThis can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported by\nthe library [1].\n\nFix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver and\nthe library as the driver was the only user. That way the lookup will\nonly return exact matches.\n\nI do not have a reliable reproducer that can reproduce the issue in a\ntimely manner, but before the fix the issue would reproduce in several\nminutes and with the fix it does not reproduce in over an hour.\n\nNote that the current usefulness of the hints is limited because they\ninclude the C-TCAM indication and represent aggregation that cannot\nactually happen. This will be addressed in net-next.\n\n[1]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 153 at lib/objagg.c:170 objagg_obj_parent_assign+0xb5/0xd0\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 153 Comm: kworker/0:18 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc6-custom-g70fbc2c1c38b #42\nHardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

the pmic_glink child drivers, the protection-domain notifiers fires,\nand the associated work is scheduled, before the client registration\nreturns and as a result the local \"client\" pointer has been initialized.\n\nThe outcome of this is a NULL pointer dereference as the \"client\"\npointer is blindly dereferenced.\n\nTimeline provided by Stephen:\n CPU0                               CPU1\n

client // Too late!\n\nThis code is identical across the altmode, battery manager and usci\nchild drivers.\n\nResolve this by splitting the allocation of the \"client\" object and the\nregistration thereof into two operations.\n\nThis only happens if the protection domain registry is populated at the\ntime of registration, which by the introduction of commit '1ebcde047c54\n(\"soc: qcom: add

endp usage after multiple re-creations\n\n'local_addr_used' and 'add_addr_accepted' are decremented for addresses\nnot related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source and\ndestination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the\nbeginning: they don't count as \"additional local address being used\" or\n\"ADD_ADDR being accepted\".\n\nIt is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used by\nthe initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Without\nthis modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added more\nthan once.(CVE-2024-46711)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: Fix double free of 'buf' in error path\n\nsmatch warning:\ndrivers/misc/fastrpc.c:1926 fastrpc_req_mmap() error: double free of 'buf'\n\nIn fastrpc_req_mmap() error path, the fastrpc buffer is freed in\nfastrpc_req_munmap_impl() if unmap is successful.\n\nBut in the end, there is an unconditional call to fastrpc_buf_free().\nSo the above case triggers the double free of fastrpc buf.(CVE-2024-46741)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: void array out of bound when loop tnl_num\n\nWhen query reg inf of SSU, it loops tnl_num times. However, tnl_num comes\nfrom hardware and the length of array is a fixed value.

If another CPU is\nconcurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it\nmay perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an\nuninitialised index.\n\nThis has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:\n\n | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n |\n | Call trace:\n |  purge_fragmented_block+0x204/0x21c\n |  _vm_unmap_aliases+0x170/0x378\n |  vm_unmap_aliases+0x1c/0x28\n |  change_memory_common+0x1dc/0x26c\n |  set_memory_ro+0x18/0x24\n |  module_enable_ro+0x98/0x238\n |  do_init_module+0x1b0/0x310\n\nMove the initialisation of 'vb-\u003ecpu' in new_vmap_block() ahead of the\naddition to the xarray.(CVE-2024-46847)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/hyperv: fix kexec crash due to VP assist page corruption\n\ncommit 9636be85cc5b (\"x86/hyperv: Fix hyperv_pcpu_input_arg handling when\nCPUs go online/offline\") introduces a new cpuhp state for hyperv\ninitialization.\n\ncpuhp_setup_state() returns the state number if state is\nCPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN or CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN and 0 for all other states.\nFor the hyperv case, since a new cpuhp state was introduced it would\nreturn 0. However, in hv_machine_shutdown(), the cpuhp_remove_state() call\nis conditioned upon \"hyperv_init_cpuhp \u003e 0\". This will never be true and\nso hv_cpu_die() won't be called on all CPUs. This means the VP assist page\nwon't be reset. When the kexec kernel tries to setup the VP assist page\nagain, the hypervisor corrupts the memory region of the old VP assist page\ncausing a panic in case the kexec kernel is using that memory elsewhere.\nThis was originally fixed in commit dfe94d4086e4 (\"x86/hyperv: Fix kexec\npanic/hang issues\").\n\nGet rid of hyperv_init_cpuhp entirely since we are no longer using a\ndynamic cpuhp state and use CPUHP_AP_HYPERV_ONLINE directly with\ncpuhp_remove_state().(CVE-2024-46864)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfou: fix initialization of grc\n\nThe grc must be initialize first. There can be a condition where if\nfou is NULL, goto out will be executed and grc would be used\nuninitialized.(CVE-2024-46865)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: hisilicon/qm - inject error before stopping queue\n\nThe master ooo cannot be completely closed when the\naccelerator core reports memory error. Therefore, the driver\nneeds to inject the qm error to close the master ooo. Currently,\nthe qm error is injected after stopping queue, memory may be\nreleased immediately after stopping queue, causing the device to\naccess the released memory. Therefore, error is injected to close master\nooo before stopping queue to ensure that the device does not access\nthe released memory.(CVE-2024-47730)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hns: Fix spin_unlock_irqrestore() called with IRQs enabled\n\nFix missuse of spin_lock_irq()/spin_unlock_irq() when\nspin_lock_irqsave()/spin_lock_irqrestore() was hold.\n\nThis was discovered through the lock debugging, and the corresponding\nlog is as follows:\n\nraw_local_irq_restore() called with IRQs enabled\nWARNING: CPU: 96 PID: 2074 at kernel/locking/irqflag-debug.c:10 warn_bogus_irq_restore+0x30/0x40\n...\nCall trace:\n warn_bogus_irq_restore+0x30/0x40\n _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x84/0xc8\n add_qp_to_list+0x11c/0x148 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n hns_roce_create_qp_common.constprop.0+0x240/0x780 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n hns_roce_create_qp+0x98/0x160 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n create_qp+0x138/0x258\n ib_create_qp_kernel+0x50/0xe8\n create_mad_qp+0xa8/0x128\n ib_mad_port_open+0x218/0x448\n ib_mad_init_device+0x70/0x1f8\n add_client_context+0xfc/0x220\n enable_device_and_get+0xd0/0x140\n ib_register_device.part.0+0xf4/0x1c8\n ib_register_device+0x34/0x50\n hns_roce_register_device+0x174/0x3d0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n hns_roce_init+0xfc/0x2c0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n __hns_roce_hw_v2_init_instance+0x7c/0x1d0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n hns_roce_hw_v2_init_instance+0x9c/0x180 [hns_roce_hw_v2](CVE-2024-47735)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation\n\nIn rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O\nthread that will handle it.

This results in undefined behavior, as UBSan\nreports:\n\nnet.c:827:2: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 1, which is declared to never be null\n\nAlthough the C standard does not explicitly state whether calling qsort\nwith a NULL pointer when the size is 0 constitutes undefined behavior,\nSection 7.1.4 of the C standard (Use of library functions) mentions:\n\n\"Each of the following statements applies unless explicitly stated\notherwise in the detailed descriptions that follow: If an argument to a\nfunction has an invalid value (such as a value outside the domain of\nthe function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program, or\na null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the\ncorresponding parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after\npromotion) not expected by a function with variable number of\narguments, the behavior is undefined.\"\n\nTo avoid this, add an early return when nf_link_info is NULL to prevent\ncalling qsort with a NULL pointer.(CVE-2024-49987)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: add refcnt to ksmbd_conn struct\n\nWhen sending an oplock break request, opinfo-\u003econn is used,\nBut freed -\u003econn can be used on multichannel.\nThis patch add a reference count to the ksmbd_conn struct\nso that it can be freed when it is no longer used.(CVE-2024-49988)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-\u003e ...\n   -\u003e dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -\u003e ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n         -\u003e lan9303_phy_read()\n            -\u003e chip-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n               -\u003e lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -\u003e dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp-\u003econduit-\u003edsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev-\u003edsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev-\u003edsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.

Its a \"known missing feature\" that concurrent VCs\nwon't work with CAMSS right now.\n\nInitial testing with this code didn't show an error but, SoftISP and \"real\"\nusage with Google Hangouts breaks the upstream code pretty quickly, we need\nto do a partial revert and take another pass at VCs.\n\nThis commit partially reverts commit 89013969e232 (\"media: camss: sm8250:\nPipeline starting and stopping for multiple virtual channels\")(CVE-2024-50175)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nremoteproc: k3-r5: Fix error handling when power-up failed\n\nBy simply bailing out, the driver was violating its rule and internal\nassumptions that either both or no rproc should be initialized. E.g.,\nthis could cause the first core to be available but not the second one,\nleading to crashes on its shutdown later on while trying to dereference\nthat second instance.(CVE-2024-50176)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: imx: Remove CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE for DRAM mux for i.MX7D\n\nFor i.MX7D DRAM related mux clock, the clock source change should ONLY\nbe done done in low level asm code without accessing DRAM, and then\ncalling clk API to sync the HW clock status with clk tree, it should never\ntouch real clock source switch via clk API, so CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE flag\nshould NOT be added, otherwise, DRAM's clock parent will be disabled when\nDRAM is active, and system will hang.(CVE-2024-50181)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Ensure DA_ID handling completion before deleting an NPIV instance\n\nDeleting an NPIV instance requires all fabric ndlps to be released before\nan NPIV's resources can be torn down.  Failure to release fabric ndlps\nbeforehand opens kref imbalance race conditions.  Fix by forcing the DA_ID\nto complete synchronously with usage of wait_queue.(CVE-2024-50183)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: amd_sfh: Switch to device-managed dmam_alloc_coherent()\n\nUsing the device-managed version allows to simplify clean-up in probe()\nerror path.\n\nAdditionally, this device-managed ensures proper cleanup, which helps to\nresolve memory errors, page faults, btrfs going read-only, and btrfs\ndisk corruption.(CVE-2024-50189)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfork: do not invoke uffd on fork if error occurs\n\nPatch series \"fork: do not expose incomplete mm on fork\".\n\nDuring fork we may place the virtual memory address space into an\ninconsistent state before the fork operation is complete.\n\nIn addition, we may encounter an error during the fork operation that\nindicates that the virtual memory address space is invalidated.\n\nAs a result, we should not be exposing it in any way to external machinery\nthat might interact with the mm or VMAs, machinery that is not designed to\ndeal with incomplete state.\n\nWe specifically update the fork logic to defer khugepaged and ksm to the\nend of the operation and only to be invoked if no error arose, and\ndisallow uffd from observing fork events should an error have occurred.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nCurrently on fork we expose the virtual address space of a process to\nuserland unconditionally if uffd is registered in VMAs, regardless of\nwhether an error arose in the fork.\n\nThis is performed in dup_userfaultfd_complete() which is invoked\nunconditionally, and performs two duties - invoking registered handlers\nfor the UFFD_EVENT_FORK event via dup_fctx(), and clearing down\nuserfaultfd_fork_ctx objects established in dup_userfaultfd().\n\nThis is problematic, because the virtual address space may not yet be\ncorrectly initialised if an error arose.\n\nThe change in commit d24062914837 (\"fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicate\nmaple tree in dup_mmap()\") makes this more pertinent as we may be in a\nstate where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.\n\nWe address this by, on fork error, ensuring that we roll back state that\nwe would otherwise expect to clean up through the event being handled by\nuserland and perform the memory freeing duty otherwise performed by\ndup_userfaultfd_complete().\n\nWe do this by implementing a new function, dup_userfaultfd_fail(), which\nperforms the same loop, only decrementing reference counts.\n\nNote that we perform mmgrab() on the parent and child mm's, however\nuserfaultfd_ctx_put() will mmdrop() this once the reference count drops to\nzero, so we will avoid memory leaks correctly here.(CVE-2024-50220)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/pm: Vangogh: Fix kernel memory out of bounds write\n\nKASAN reports that the GPU metrics table allocated in\nvangogh_tables_init() is not large enough for the memset done in\nsmu_cmn_init_soft_gpu_metrics().

As a result, nommu kernels crashed upon\naccessing a vma iterator, such as acct_collect() reading the size of vma\nentries after do_munmap().\n\nThis commit fixes this issue by passing a right argument to the\npreallocation call.(CVE-2024-53109)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: fix NULL pointer dereference in alloc_pages_bulk_noprof\n\nWe triggered a NULL pointer dereference for ac.preferred_zoneref-\u003ezone in\nalloc_pages_bulk_noprof() when the task is migrated between cpusets.\n\nWhen cpuset is enabled, in prepare_alloc_pages(), ac-\u003enodemask may be\n\u0026current-\u003emems_allowed.  when first_zones_zonelist() is called to find\npreferred_zoneref, the ac-\u003enodemask may be modified concurrently if the\ntask is migrated between different cpusets.  Assuming we have 2 NUMA Node,\nwhen traversing Node1 in ac-\u003ezonelist, the nodemask is 2, and when\ntraversing Node2 in ac-\u003ezonelist, the nodemask is 1.  As a result, the\nac-\u003epreferred_zoneref points to NULL zone.\n\nIn alloc_pages_bulk_noprof(), for_each_zone_zonelist_nodemask() finds a\nallowable zone and calls zonelist_node_idx(ac.preferred_zoneref), leading\nto NULL pointer dereference.\n\n__alloc_pages_noprof() fixes this issue by checking NULL pointer in commit\nea57485af8f4 (\"mm, page_alloc: fix check for NULL preferred_zone\") and\ncommit df76cee6bbeb (\"mm, page_alloc: remove redundant checks from alloc\nfastpath\").\n\nTo fix it, check NULL pointer for preferred_zoneref-\u003ezone.(CVE-2024-53113)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio/vsock: Fix accept_queue memory leak\n\nAs the final stages of socket destruction may be delayed, it is possible\nthat virtio_transport_recv_listen() will be called after the accept_queue\nhas been flushed, but before the SOCK_DONE flag has been set.

following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: VMX: Bury Intel PT virtualization (guest/host mode) behind CONFIG_BROKEN\n\nHide KVM's pt_mode module param behind CONFIG_BROKEN, i.e. disable support\nfor virtualizing Intel PT via guest/host mode unless BROKEN=y.  There are\nmyriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,\nand others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.\n\nFor guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure\ntracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is\nnecessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing\nis enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).  Per the SDM:\n\n  If the logical processor is operating with Intel PT enabled (if\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn = 1) at the time of VM entry, the \"load\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL\" VM-entry control must be 0.\n\nOn the host side, KVM doesn't validate the guest CPUID configuration\nprovided by userspace, and even worse, uses the guest configuration to\ndecide what MSRs to save/load at VM-Enter and VM-Exit.  E.g. configuring\nguest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware\nwill result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,\nwhich generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential\ndeadlock, etc.(CVE-2024-53135)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcounting\n\nThe kTLS tx handling code is using a mix of get_page() and\npage_ref_inc() APIs to increment the page reference. But on the release\npath (mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp()), only put_page() is used.\n\nThis is an issue when using pages from large folios: the get_page()\nreferences are stored on the folio page while the page_ref_inc()\nreferences are stored directly in the given page. On release the folio\npage will be dereferenced too many times.\n\nThis was found while doing kTLS testing with sendfile() + ZC when the\nserved file was read from NFS on a kernel with NFS large folios support\n(commit 49b29a573da8 (\"nfs: add support for large folios\")).(CVE-2024-53138)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: fix possible UAF in sctp_v6_available()\n\nA lockdep report [1] with CONFIG_PROVE_RCU_LIST=y hints\nthat sctp_v6_available() is calling dev_get_by_index_rcu()\nand ipv6_chk_addr() without holding rcu.\n\n[1]\n =============================\n WARNING: suspicious RCU usage\n 6.12.0-rc5-virtme #1216 Tainted: G        W\n -----------------------------\n net/core/dev.c:876 RCU-list traversed in non-reader section!!\n\nother info that might help us debug this:\n\nrcu_scheduler_active = 2, debug_locks = 1\n 1 lock held by sctp_hello/31495:\n #0: ffff9f1ebbdb7418 (sk_lock-AF_INET6){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: sctp_bind (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 net/sctp/socket.c:315) sctp\n\nstack backtrace:\n CPU: 7 UID: 0 PID: 31495 Comm: sctp_hello Tainted: G        W          6.12.0-rc5-virtme #1216\n Tainted: [W]=WARN\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-debian-1.16.3-2 04/01/2014\n Call Trace:\n  \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:123)\n lockdep_rcu_suspicious (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:6822)\n dev_get_by_index_rcu (net/core/dev.c:876 (discriminator 7))\n sctp_v6_available (net/sctp/ipv6.c:701) sctp\n sctp_do_bind (net/sctp/socket.c:400 (discriminator 1)) sctp\n sctp_bind (net/sctp/socket.c:320) sctp\n inet6_bind_sk (net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:465)\n ? security_socket_bind (security/security.c:4581 (discriminator 1))\n __sys_bind (net/socket.c:1848 net/socket.c:1869)\n ? do_user_addr_fault (./include/linux/rcupdate.h:347 ./include/linux/rcupdate.h:880 ./include/linux/mm.h:729 arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1340)\n ? do_user_addr_fault (./arch/x86/include/asm/preempt.h:84 (discriminator 13) ./include/linux/rcupdate.h:98 (discriminator 13) ./include/linux/rcupdate.h:882 (discriminator 13) ./include/linux/mm.h:729 (discriminator 13) arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1340 (discriminator 13))\n __x64_sys_bind (net/socket.c:1877 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:1875 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:1875 (discriminator 1))\n do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 (discriminator 1))\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)\n RIP: 0033:0x7f59b934a1e7\n Code: 44 00 00 48 8b 15 39 8c 0c 00 f7 d8 64 89 02 b8 ff ff ff ff eb bd 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 00 b8 31 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d 09 8c 0c 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nAll code\n========\n   0:\t44 00 00             \tadd    %r8b,(%rax)\n   3:\t48 8b 15 39 8c 0c 00 \tmov    0xc8c39(%rip),%rdx        # 0xc8c43\n   a:\tf7 d8                \tneg    %eax\n   c:\t64 89 02             \tmov    %eax,%fs:(%rdx)\n   f:\tb8 ff ff ff ff       \tmov    $0xffffffff,%eax\n  14:\teb bd                \tjmp    0xffffffffffffffd3\n  16:\t66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 \tcs nopw 0x0(%rax,%rax,1)\n  1d:\t00 00 00\n  20:\t0f 1f 00             \tnopl   (%rax)\n  23:\tb8 31 00 00 00       \tmov    $0x31,%eax\n  28:\t0f 05                \tsyscall\n  2a:*\t48 3d 01 f0 ff ff    \tcmp    $0xfffffffffffff001,%rax\t\t\u003c-- trapping instruction\n  30:\t73 01                \tjae    0x33\n  32:\tc3                   \tret\n  33:\t48 8b 0d 09 8c 0c 00 \tmov    0xc8c09(%rip),%rcx        # 0xc8c43\n  3a:\tf7 d8                \tneg    %eax\n  3c:\t64 89 01             \tmov    %eax,%fs:(%rcx)\n  3f:\t48                   \trex.W\n\nCode starting with the faulting instruction\n===========================================\n   0:\t48 3d 01 f0 ff ff    \tcmp    $0xfffffffffffff001,%rax\n   6:\t73 01                \tjae    0x9\n   8:\tc3                   \tret\n   9:\t48 8b 0d 09 8c 0c 00 \tmov    0xc8c09(%rip),%rcx        # 0xc8c19\n  10:\tf7 d8                \tneg    %eax\n  12:\t64 89 01             \tmov    %eax,%fs:(%rcx)\n  15:\t48                   \trex.W\n RSP: 002b:00007ffe2d0ad398 EFLAGS: 00000202 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000031\n RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe2d0ad3d0 RCX: 00007f59b934a1e7\n RDX: 000000000000001c RSI: 00007ffe2d0ad3d0 RDI: 0000000000000005\n RBP: 0000000000000005 R08: 1999999999999999 R09: 0000000000000000\n R10: 00007f59b9253298 R11: 000000000000\n---truncated---(CVE-2024-53139)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetlink: terminate outstanding dump on socket close\n\nNetlink supports iterative dumping of data. It provides the families\nthe following ops:\n - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process\n - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0\n - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup\nThe whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump\ndon't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered\nin response to recvmsg() on the socket.\n\nThis gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that\nthe user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.\nTo make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there\nis an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.\n\nThe complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done\nis allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when\nneeded.\n\nUnfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not\nthe cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.\nWe have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone\nelse holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back\nto square one.\n\nThe whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user\ncan interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.\nAnd close always happens in process context. Some async code may\nstill access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.\nbut no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.\n\nDelete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release\nhandler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance\nwe now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,\nso dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own.(CVE-2024-53140)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_event: Align BR/EDR JUST_WORKS paring with LE\n\nThis aligned BR/EDR JUST_WORKS method with LE which since 92516cd97fd4\n(\"Bluetooth: Always request for user confirmation for Just Works\")\nalways request user confirmation with confirm_hint set since the\nlikes of bluetoothd have dedicated policy around JUST_WORKS method\n(e.g. main.conf:JustWorksRepairing).\n\nCVE: CVE-2024-8805(CVE-2024-53144)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\num: Fix potential integer overflow during physmem setup\n\nThis issue happens when the real map size is greater than LONG_MAX,\nwhich can be easily triggered on UML/i386.(CVE-2024-53145)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock, bfq: fix bfqq uaf in bfq_limit_depth()\n\nSet new allocated bfqq to bic or remove freed bfqq from bic are both\nprotected by bfqd-\u003elock, however bfq_limit_depth() is deferencing bfqq\nfrom bic without the lock, this can lead to UAF if the io_context is\nshared by multiple tasks.\n\nFor example, test bfq with io_uring can trigger following UAF in v6.6:\n\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in bfqq_group+0x15/0x50\n\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x47/0x80\n print_address_description.constprop.0+0x66/0x300\n print_report+0x3e/0x70\n kasan_report+0xb4/0xf0\n bfqq_group+0x15/0x50\n bfqq_request_over_limit+0x130/0x9a0\n bfq_limit_depth+0x1b5/0x480\n __blk_mq_alloc_requests+0x2b5/0xa00\n blk_mq_get_new_requests+0x11d/0x1d0\n blk_mq_submit_bio+0x286/0xb00\n submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x331/0x400\n __block_write_full_folio+0x3d0/0x640\n writepage_cb+0x3b/0xc0\n write_cache_pages+0x254/0x6c0\n write_cache_pages+0x254/0x6c0\n do_writepages+0x192/0x310\n filemap_fdatawrite_wbc+0x95/0xc0\n __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0x99/0xd0\n filemap_write_and_wait_range.part.0+0x4d/0xa0\n blkdev_read_iter+0xef/0x1e0\n io_read+0x1b6/0x8a0\n io_issue_sqe+0x87/0x300\n io_wq_submit_work+0xeb/0x390\n io_worker_handle_work+0x24d/0x550\n io_wq_worker+0x27f/0x6c0\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 808602:\n kasan_save_stack+0x1e/0x40\n kasan_set_track+0x21/0x30\n __kasan_slab_alloc+0x83/0x90\n kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1b1/0x6d0\n bfq_get_queue+0x138/0xfa0\n bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split+0xe3/0x2c0\n bfq_init_rq+0x196/0xbb0\n bfq_insert_request.isra.0+0xb5/0x480\n bfq_insert_requests+0x156/0x180\n blk_mq_insert_request+0x15d/0x440\n blk_mq_submit_bio+0x8a4/0xb00\n submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x331/0x400\n __blkdev_direct_IO_async+0x2dd/0x330\n blkdev_write_iter+0x39a/0x450\n io_write+0x22a/0x840\n io_issue_sqe+0x87/0x300\n io_wq_submit_work+0xeb/0x390\n io_worker_handle_work+0x24d/0x550\n io_wq_worker+0x27f/0x6c0\n ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n\nFreed by task 808589:\n kasan_save_stack+0x1e/0x40\n kasan_set_track+0x21/0x30\n kasan_save_free_info+0x27/0x40\n __kasan_slab_free+0x126/0x1b0\n kmem_cache_free+0x10c/0x750\n bfq_put_queue+0x2dd/0x770\n __bfq_insert_request.isra.0+0x155/0x7a0\n bfq_insert_request.isra.0+0x122/0x480\n bfq_insert_requests+0x156/0x180\n blk_mq_dispatch_plug_list+0x528/0x7e0\n blk_mq_flush_plug_list.part.0+0xe5/0x590\n __blk_flush_plug+0x3b/0x90\n blk_finish_plug+0x40/0x60\n do_writepages+0x19d/0x310\n filemap_fdatawrite_wbc+0x95/0xc0\n __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0x99/0xd0\n filemap_write_and_wait_range.part.0+0x4d/0xa0\n blkdev_read_iter+0xef/0x1e0\n io_read+0x1b6/0x8a0\n io_issue_sqe+0x87/0x300\n io_wq_submit_work+0xeb/0x390\n io_worker_handle_work+0x24d/0x550\n io_wq_worker+0x27f/0x6c0\n ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n\nFix the problem by protecting bic_to_bfqq() with bfqd-\u003elock.(CVE-2024-53166)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx-\u003eplane_state in dcn20_program_pipeThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue indcn20_program_pipe().

The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().\n2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an\n   interrupt.\n3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an\n   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has\n   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag\n   remains set.\n4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call\n   of req-\u003ecomplete(), as shown in the call trace above.\n5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)\n   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the\n   request before invoking the callback.\n6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware\n   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains\n   set.\n\nFor this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at\nsome point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet\ngadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the\ntask context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are\nre-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The\ngadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but\nthe first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,\ntriggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet\narrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from\nreceiving any further packets from the USB host.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This\nparticular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:\n\n1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to\n   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was\n   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.\n   Similar \"bugs\" could be hidden in other drivers as well.\n2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback\n   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),\n   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled\n   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow\n   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an\n   inelegant hack.\n3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request\n   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes\n   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is\n   not ready to process them.\n4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().\n   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at\n   least one request in the queue.

It targets the\nsame problem as the following downstream commit:\n\n  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995\n\nUnlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe\ndevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k\nor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the\ndriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with\nexisting practices.\n\nUpon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an\nexample of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:\n\n  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible\n  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944\n\nWithout this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a\nPCIe device is connected.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, added tag for stable releases](CVE-2024-57809)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL\n\nCurrently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl'\nvariable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this\nuninitialized. Consequently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() will consume an\narbitrary value, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the\nkernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and\nthe issue does not provide a write mechanism.\n\nAs set_tagged_addr_ctrl() only accepts values where bits [63:4] zero and\nrejects other values, a partial SETREGSET attempt will randomly succeed\nor fail depending on the value of the uninitialized value, and the\nexposure is significantly limited.\n\nFix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset\nfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,\nNT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing\nvalue of the tagged address ctrl will be retained.\n\nThe NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL regset is only visible in the\nuser_aarch64_view used by a native AArch64 task to manipulate another\nnative AArch64 task. As get_tagged_addr_ctrl() only returns an error\nvalue when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and\ntagged_addr_ctrl_set() should never observe an error value from\nget_tagged_addr_ctrl(). Add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to both to indicate that\nsuch an error would be unexpected, and error handlnig is not missing in\neither case.(CVE-2024-57874)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv\n\nWhen mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a\nslab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to\nquota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)-\u003edqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups](CVE-2024-57892)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: ti-ads8688: fix information leak in triggered buffer\n\nThe 'buffer' local array is used to push data to user space from a\ntriggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as\nit only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.\n\nInitialize the array to zero before using it to avoid pushing\nuninitialized information to userspace.(CVE-2024-57906)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: light: vcnl4035: fix information leak in triggered buffer\n\nThe 'buffer' local array is used to push data to userspace from a\ntriggered buffer, but it does not set an initial value for the single\ndata element, which is an u16 aligned to 8 bytes.

Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an -\u003eactive() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -\u003eactive() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The -\u003eactive() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the -\u003eget() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer.

The -\u003elength is the length\nof the buffer.  The -\u003ebytesused is how many bytes we have copied thus\nfar.  When the condition is reversed that means the result of the\nsubtraction is always negative but since it's unsigned then the result\nis a very high positive value.  That means the overflow check is never\ntrue.\n\nAdditionally, the -\u003ebytesused doesn't actually work for this purpose\nbecause we're not writing to \"buf-\u003emem + buf-\u003ebytesused\".  Instead, the\nmath to calculate the destination where we are writing is a bit\ninvolved.  You calculate the number of full lines already written,\nmultiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an odd\nnumbered line, and add the offset into the line.\n\nTo fix this buffer overflow, just take the actual destination where we\nare writing, if the offset is already out of bounds print an error and\nreturn.  Otherwise, write up to buf-\u003elength bytes.",

Either the link has failed and the system is in need\nof maintenance, or the link continues to work and user has been informed.\nThe message from the warning can be looked up in the sources.\n\nThis makes an actual link issue less verbose.\n\nFirst of all, this controller has a limitation in that the controller\ndriver has to assist the hardware with transition to L1 link state by\nwriting L1IATN to PMCTRL register, the L1 and L0 link state switching\nis not fully automatic on this controller.\n\nIn case of an ASMedia ASM1062 PCIe SATA controller which does not support\nASPM, on entry to suspend or during platform pm_test, the SATA controller\nenters D3hot state and the link enters L1 state. If the SATA controller\nwakes up before rcar_pcie_wakeup() was called and returns to D0, the link\nreturns to L0 before the controller driver even started its transition to\nL1 link state. At this point, the SATA controller did send an PM_ENTER_L1\nDLLP to the PCIe controller and the PCIe controller received it, and the\nPCIe controller did set PMSR PMEL1RX bit.\n\nOnce rcar_pcie_wakeup() is called, if the link is already back in L0 state\nand PMEL1RX bit is set, the controller driver has no way to determine if\nit should perform the link transition to L1 state, or treat the link as if\nit is in L0 state. Currently the driver attempts to perform the transition\nto L1 link state unconditionally, which in this specific case fails with a\nPMSR L1FAEG poll timeout, however the link still works as it is already\nback in L0 state.\n\nReduce this warning verbosity.

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-43880",
      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warning\n\nACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM\n(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former can\ncontain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in each\nregion (i.e., tc chain) is limited.\n\nIn order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the device\nallows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in up\nto 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented using\ndst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on the\nnumber of masks being used (and therefore does not support mask\naggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.\n\nThe driver uses the \"objagg\" library to perform the mask aggregation by\npassing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether the\nfilter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters in\ndifferent TCAMs cannot share a mask.\n\nThe set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of the\nfilters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver will\nperiodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set (\"hints\") by\nlooking at all the existing objects.\n\nWhen the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregated\nthe driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /\nC-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is to\nmove as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbids\ntwo identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen if\none was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in the\nA-TCAM.\n\nThe above can result in the following set of hints:\n\nH1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -\u003e H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + delta\nH3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -\u003e H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + delta\n\nAfter getting the hints from the library the driver will start migrating\nfilters from one region to another while consulting the computed hints\nand instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions during\nthe transition.\n\nAssuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in the\nnew region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent of\nH1, the library will try to find the object associated with it and\ncreate it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)\nwill be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will either\nreturn H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparison\nfunction that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.\n\nThis can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported by\nthe library [1].\n\nFix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver and\nthe library as the driver was the only user.

That happens because we pass the uninitialized gisa\norigin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation.\n\nTo fix this we return 0 in kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() if the origin is 0.\nkvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() is used to determine which gisa designation to\nset in the SIE control block. A value of 0 in the gisa designation disables\ngisa usage.\n\nThe issue surfaces in the host kernel with the following kernel message as\nsoon a new kvm guest start is attemted.\n\nkvm: unhandled validity intercept 0x1011\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 781237 at arch/s390/kvm/intercept.c:101 kvm_handle_sie_intercept+0x42e/0x4d0 [kvm]\nModules linked in: vhost_net tap tun xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack ipt_REJECT xt_tcpudp nft_compat x_tables nf_nat_tftp nf_conntrack_tftp vfio_pci_core irqbypass vhost_vsock vmw_vsock_virtio_transport_common vsock vhost vhost_iotlb kvm nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6 nft_fib nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject nft_ct nft_chain_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 ip_set nf_tables sunrpc mlx5_ib ib_uverbs ib_core mlx5_core uvdevice s390_trng eadm_sch vfio_ccw zcrypt_cex4 mdev vfio_iommu_type1 vfio sch_fq_codel drm i2c_core loop drm_panel_orientation_quirks configfs nfnetlink lcs ctcm fsm dm_service_time ghash_s390 prng chacha_s390 libchacha aes_s390 des_s390 libdes sha3_512_s390 sha3_256_s390 sha512_s390 sha256_s390 sha1_s390 sha_common dm_mirror dm_region_hash dm_log zfcp scsi_transport_fc scsi_dh_rdac scsi_dh_emc scsi_dh_alua pkey zcrypt dm_multipath rng_core autofs4 [last unloaded: vfio_pci]\nCPU: 0 PID: 781237 Comm: CPU 0/KVM Not tainted 6.10.0-08682-gcad9f11498ea #6\nHardware name: IBM 3931 A01 701 (LPAR)\nKrnl PSW : 0704c00180000000 000003d93deb0122 (kvm_handle_sie_intercept+0x432/0x4d0 [kvm])\n           R:0 T:1 IO:1 EX:1 Key:0 M:1 W:0 P:0 AS:3 CC:0 PM:0 RI:0 EA:3\nKrnl GPRS: 000003d900000027 000003d900000023 0000000000000028 000002cd00000000\n           000002d063a00900 00000359c6daf708 00000000000bebb5 0000000000001eff\n           000002cfd82e9000 000002cfd80bc000 0000000000001011 000003d93deda412\n           000003ff8962df98 000003d93de77ce0 000003d93deb011e 00000359c6daf960\nKrnl Code: 000003d93deb0112: c020fffe7259\tlarl\t%r2,000003d93de7e5c4\n           000003d93deb0118: c0e53fa8beac\tbrasl\t%r14,000003d9bd3c7e70\n          #000003d93deb011e: af000000\t\tmc\t0,0\n          \u003e000003d93deb0122: a728ffea\t\tlhi\t%r2,-22\n           000003d93deb0126: a7f4fe24\t\tbrc\t15,000003d93deafd6e\n           000003d93deb012a: 9101f0b0\t\ttm\t176(%r15),1\n           000003d93deb012e: a774fe48\t\tbrc\t7,000003d93deafdbe\n           000003d93deb0132: 40a0f0ae\t\tsth\t%r10,174(%r15)\nCall Trace:\n [\u003c000003d93deb0122\u003e] kvm_handle_sie_intercept+0x432/0x4d0 [kvm]\n([\u003c000003d93deb011e\u003e] kvm_handle_sie_intercept+0x42e/0x4d0 [kvm])\n [\u003c000003d93deacc10\u003e] vcpu_post_run+0x1d0/0x3b0 [kvm]\n [\u003c000003d93deaceda\u003e] __vcpu_run+0xea/0x2d0 [kvm]\n [\u003c000003d93dead9da\u003e] kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x16a/0x430 [kvm]\n [\u003c000003d93de93ee0\u003e] kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x190/0x7c0 [kvm]\n [\u003c000003d9bd728b4e\u003e] vfs_ioctl+0x2e/0x70\n [\u003c000003d9bd72a092\u003e] __s390x_sys_ioctl+0xc2/0xd0\n [\u003c000003d9be0e9222\u003e] __do_syscall+0x1f2/0x2e0\n [\u003c000003d9be0f9a90\u003e] system_call+0x70/0x98\nLast Breaking-Event-Address:\n [\u003c000003d9bd3c7f58\u003e] __warn_printk+0xe8/0xf0",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-49998",
      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-\u003e ...\n   -\u003e dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -\u003e ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n         -\u003e lan9303_phy_read()\n            -\u003e chip-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n               -\u003e lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -\u003e dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp-\u003econduit-\u003edsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev-\u003edsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev-\u003edsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit-\u003edsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n(\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit-\u003edsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up).",

The problem is that the\nnew remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and\ntherefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.\n\nFix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre\nnet device changes and removing the old one.

Now things will go\nhorribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory\nregion, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be\ntriggered :(\n\nIn contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly\nas expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged\ndata and paged frags actually.\n\nThis patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index\nfor tx_q-\u003etx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.\n\nTested and verified on DWXGMAC CORE 3.20a",

There are\nmyriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,\nand others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.\n\nFor guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure\ntracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is\nnecessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing\nis enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).  Per the SDM:\n\n  If the logical processor is operating with Intel PT enabled (if\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn = 1) at the time of VM entry, the \"load\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL\" VM-entry control must be 0.\n\nOn the host side, KVM doesn't validate the guest CPUID configuration\nprovided by userspace, and even worse, uses the guest configuration to\ndecide what MSRs to save/load at VM-Enter and VM-Exit.  E.g. configuring\nguest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware\nwill result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,\nwhich generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential\ndeadlock, etc.",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetlink: terminate outstanding dump on socket close\n\nNetlink supports iterative dumping of data. It provides the families\nthe following ops:\n - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process\n - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0\n - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup\nThe whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump\ndon't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered\nin response to recvmsg() on the socket.\n\nThis gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that\nthe user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.\nTo make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there\nis an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.\n\nThe complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done\nis allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when\nneeded.\n\nUnfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not\nthe cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.\nWe have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone\nelse holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back\nto square one.\n\nThe whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user\ncan interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.\nAnd close always happens in process context. Some async code may\nstill access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.\nbut no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.\n\nDelete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release\nhandler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance\nwe now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,\nso dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own.",

The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().\n2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an\n   interrupt.\n3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an\n   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has\n   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag\n   remains set.\n4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call\n   of req-\u003ecomplete(), as shown in the call trace above.\n5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)\n   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the\n   request before invoking the callback.\n6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware\n   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains\n   set.\n\nFor this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at\nsome point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet\ngadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the\ntask context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are\nre-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The\ngadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but\nthe first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,\ntriggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet\narrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from\nreceiving any further packets from the USB host.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This\nparticular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:\n\n1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to\n   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was\n   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.\n   Similar \"bugs\" could be hidden in other drivers as well.\n2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback\n   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),\n   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled\n   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow\n   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an\n   inelegant hack.\n3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request\n   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes\n   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is\n   not ready to process them.\n4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().\n   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at\n   least one request in the queue.

It targets the\nsame problem as the following downstream commit:\n\n  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995\n\nUnlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe\ndevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k\nor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the\ndriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with\nexisting practices.\n\nUpon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an\nexample of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:\n\n  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible\n  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944\n\nWithout this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a\nPCIe device is connected.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, added tag for stable releases]",

Consequently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() will consume an\narbitrary value, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the\nkernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and\nthe issue does not provide a write mechanism.\n\nAs set_tagged_addr_ctrl() only accepts values where bits [63:4] zero and\nrejects other values, a partial SETREGSET attempt will randomly succeed\nor fail depending on the value of the uninitialized value, and the\nexposure is significantly limited.\n\nFix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset\nfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,\nNT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing\nvalue of the tagged address ctrl will be retained.\n\nThe NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL regset is only visible in the\nuser_aarch64_view used by a native AArch64 task to manipulate another\nnative AArch64 task. As get_tagged_addr_ctrl() only returns an error\nvalue when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and\ntagged_addr_ctrl_set() should never observe an error value from\nget_tagged_addr_ctrl().

Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)-\u003edqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registers\n\nThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an -\u003eactive() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -\u003eactive() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The -\u003eactive() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the -\u003eget() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are\nset at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be\nsomething to find in the XSAVE buffer.\n\n[ dhansen: changelog/subject tweaks ]",
