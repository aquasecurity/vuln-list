      "Text": "The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as critical was found in libssh up to 0.11.1.The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-119. The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Upgrading to version 0.11.2 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-4877)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in libssh up to 0.11.1.Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-824. The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.Upgrading to version 0.11.2 eliminates this vulnerability.(CVE-2025-4878)\n\nA flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2025-5372)",
