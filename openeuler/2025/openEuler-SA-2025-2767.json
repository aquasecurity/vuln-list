It first loads\nthe '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()\nand then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir\nentry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the\nsame data block.\n\nIf the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the\nsanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data\nblock) and leaves \"struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de\" point exactly past the\nmemory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to\next4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer\nwhich results in out-of-bounds mem access.\n\nFix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir\nentries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony\ndir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).\n\nNote: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another\nstructure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is\nreally an OOB read.\n\nThis issue was found by syzkaller tool.\n\nCall Trace:\n[   38.594108] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.594649] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88802b41a004 by task syz-executor/5375\n[   38.595158]\n[   38.595288] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5375 Comm: syz-executor Not tainted 6.14.0-rc7 #1\n[   38.595298] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[   38.595304] Call Trace:\n[   38.595308]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[   38.595311]  dump_stack_lvl+0xa7/0xd0\n[   38.595325]  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x3f0\n[   38.595339]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595349]  print_report+0xaa/0x250\n[   38.595359]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595368]  ? kasan_addr_to_slab+0x9/0x90\n[   38.595378]  kasan_report+0xab/0xe0\n[   38.595389]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595400]  __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595410]  ext4_empty_dir+0x465/0x990\n[   38.595421]  ? __pfx_ext4_empty_dir+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595432]  ext4_rmdir.part.0+0x29a/0xd10\n[   38.595441]  ? __dquot_initialize+0x2a7/0xbf0\n[   38.595455]  ? __pfx_ext4_rmdir.part.0+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595464]  ? __pfx___dquot_initialize+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595478]  ? down_write+0xdb/0x140\n[   38.595487]  ? __pfx_down_write+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595497]  ext4_rmdir+0xee/0x140\n[   38.595506]  vfs_rmdir+0x209/0x670\n[   38.595517]  ? lookup_one_qstr_excl+0x3b/0x190\n[   38.595529]  do_rmdir+0x363/0x3c0\n[   38.595537]  ? __pfx_do_rmdir+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595544]  ? strncpy_from_user+0x1ff/0x2e0\n[   38.595561]  __x64_sys_unlinkat+0xf0/0x130\n[   38.595570]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x180\n[   38.595583]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e(CVE-2025-37785)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdns3: Fix deadlock when using NCM gadget\n\nThe cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit\n58f2fcb3a845 (\"usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget\").\n\nUnder PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network\ntraffic, for example using \"iperf --bidir\" over NCM ethernet link.\n\nThe deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets\npreempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock.\nPrevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.(CVE-2025-37812)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()\n\nA race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler:\nonce a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq-\u003emq_hctx to\nNULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in\nufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is\ndereferenced, the kernel will crash.\n\nAdd a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an\nerror and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer\ndereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is\nremoved.\n\nThis is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 (\"scsi: ufs: core: Fix\nufshcd_abort_one racing issue\").\n\nThis is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.(CVE-2025-37828)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njbd2: remove wrong sb-\u003es_sequence check\n\nJournal emptiness is not determined by sb-\u003es_sequence == 0 but rather by\nsb-\u003es_start == 0 (which is set a few lines above). Furthermore 0 is a\nvalid transaction ID so the check can spuriously trigger. Remove the\ninvalid WARN_ON.(CVE-2025-37839)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\novl: don't allow datadir only\n\nIn theory overlayfs could support upper layer directly referring to a data\nlayer, but there's no current use case for this.\n\nOriginally, when data-only layers were introduced, this wasn't allowed,\nonly introduced by the \"datadir+\" feature, but without actually handling\nthis case, resulting in an Oops.\n\nFix by disallowing datadir without lowerdir.(CVE-2025-37863)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: ump: Fix buffer overflow at UMP SysEx message conversion\n\nThe conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains an\ninternal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, as\nit was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data.\nHowever, the implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in a\ndifferent format, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found in\ndo_convert_to_ump().  It leads eventually to a buffer overflow, and\nmay corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received.\n\nThe fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysEx\nUMP message.(CVE-2025-37891)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before\n\nCurrently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through\nvm_ops-\u003emay_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[(CVE-2025-38084)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies\n\nio_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or\nwhen a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.(CVE-2025-38100)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: marvell/cesa - Handle zero-length skcipher requests\n\nDo not access random memory for zero-length skcipher requests.\nJust return 0.(CVE-2025-38173)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: Fix fb_set_var to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var\n\nIf fb_add_videomode() in fb_set_var() fails to allocate memory for\nfb_videomode, later it may lead to a null-ptr dereference in\nfb_videomode_to_var(), as the fb_info is registered while not having the\nmode in modelist that is expected to be there, i.e. the one that is\ndescribed in fb_info-\u003evar.\n\n================================================================\ngeneral protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000001: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000008-0x000000000000000f]\nCPU: 1 PID: 30371 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 5.10.226-syzkaller #0\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.12.0-1 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:fb_videomode_to_var+0x24/0x610 drivers/video/fbdev/core/modedb.c:901\nCall Trace:\n display_to_var+0x3a/0x7c0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:929\n fbcon_resize+0x3e2/0x8f0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:2071\n resize_screen drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:1176 [inline]\n vc_do_resize+0x53a/0x1170 drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:1263\n fbcon_modechanged+0x3ac/0x6e0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:2720\n fbcon_update_vcs+0x43/0x60 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:2776\n do_fb_ioctl+0x6d2/0x740 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1128\n fb_ioctl+0xe7/0x150 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1203\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:48 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:753 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:739 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x19a/0x210 fs/ioctl.c:739\n do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40 arch/x86/entry/common.c:46\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x67/0xd1\n================================================================\n\nThe reason is that fb_info-\u003evar is being modified in fb_set_var(), and\nthen fb_videomode_to_var() is called.

If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-\u003e kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThat pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the\ncode in question will delay the actual call to \"ep_free(ep)\" until after\nit has unlocked the mutex.\n\nBut it's wrong for the much subtler \"next to last\" case when somebody\n*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're\nstill using the mutex.\n\nNote that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep\nmutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,\neven if they guarantee mutual exclusion.\n\nA mutex \"unlock\" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still\naccessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in\nand get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the\nfirst user is still cleaning up.\n\nSee our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,\nin particular the section [1] about semantics:\n\n\t\"mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has\n\t internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for\n\t another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the\n\t mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore\"\n\nSo if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the\nlast one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops\n_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all\nwhile the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.\n\nFix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:\nthe refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's\nthe whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently\nabout object lifetimes).(CVE-2025-38349)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: ccp - Fix crash when rebind ccp device for ccp.ko\n\nWhen CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_CCP_DEBUGFS is enabled, rebinding\nthe ccp device causes the following crash:\n\n$ echo '0000:0a:00.2' \u003e /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ccp/unbind\n$ echo '0000:0a:00.2' \u003e /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ccp/bind\n\n[  204.976930] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000098\n[  204.978026] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\n[  204.979126] #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page\n[  204.980226] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[  204.981317] Oops: Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n...\n[  204.997852] Call Trace:\n[  204.999074]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  205.000297]  start_creating+0x9f/0x1c0\n[  205.001533]  debugfs_create_dir+0x1f/0x170\n[  205.002769]  ?

This validation only\nvalidates the skb-\u003elen (directly reflects size provided at the\nuserspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer\nitself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER). This leads to the processing\nof memory content at the address assuming the correct layout\nper what opcode requires there. This leads to the accesses to\nbuffer of `skb_buff-\u003edata` which is not assigned anything yet.\n\nFollowing the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at\n`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective\nhandlers and return error values in case of failure.

The driver's default interrupt mask setting logic is flawed, as the interrupt mask value should be completely controlled by user space. If the mask bit gets changed by the driver concurrently with user mode operating on the ring, the mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, causing the user-mode driver to miss an interrupt and leading to a system hang.\n\nSpecifically, when the driver sets the inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1, the host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel. However, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a message in the inbound ring buffer. This results in the host putting a message into the ring buffer without interruption. Subsequently, when user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 0 and waits for an interrupt via pread(), since there's already a message in the ring buffer, no new interrupt is generated, causing pread() to wait indefinitely.\n\nThe fix removes all instances where interrupt_mask is changed, while keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable user space control of the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.(CVE-2025-40048)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dlink: handle copy_thresh allocation failure\n\nThe driver did not handle failure of `netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align()`.\nIf the allocation failed, dereferencing `skb-\u003eprotocol` could lead to\na NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis patch tries to allocate `skb`.

When the hfsplus_strcasecmp() logic is triggered, it causes a slab-out-of-bounds read, allowing attackers to read sensitive information from kernel memory. This vulnerability triggers KASAN-detected boundary check errors and could be exploited for information disclosure or system crash attacks.(CVE-2025-40088)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: crypto: rng - Ensure set_ent is always present. Ensure that set_ent is always set since only drbg provides it. The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40109 to this issue.(CVE-2025-40109)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix a null-ptr access in the cursor snooper\n\nCheck that the resource which is converted to a surface exists before\ntrying to use the cursor snooper on it.\n\nvmw_cmd_res_check allows explicit invalid (SVGA3D_INVALID_ID) identifiers\nbecause some svga commands accept SVGA3D_INVALID_ID to mean \"no surface\",\nunfortunately functions that accept the actual surfaces as objects might\n(and in case of the cursor snooper, do not) be able to handle null\nobjects.

On AX88772B, autosuspend shows no\nmeasurable power saving with current driver (no link partner, admin\nup/down). The ~0.453 W -\u003e ~0.248 W drop on v6.1 comes from phylib powering\nthe PHY off on admin-down, not from USB autosuspend.\n\nThe real hazard is that with runtime PM enabled, ndo_open() (under RTNL)\nmay synchronously trigger autoresume (usb_autopm_get_interface()) into\nasix_resume() while the USB PM lock is held. Resume paths then invoke\nphylink/phylib and MDIO, which also expect RTNL, leading to possible\ndeadlocks or PM lock vs MDIO wake issues.\n\nTo avoid this, keep the device runtime-PM active by taking a usage\nreference in ax88772_bind() and dropping it in unbind(). A non-zero PM\nusage count blocks runtime suspend regardless of userspace policy\n(.../power/control - pm_runtime_allow/forbid), making this approach\nrobust against sysfs overrides.\n\nHolding a runtime-PM usage ref does not affect system-wide suspend;\nsystem sleep/resume callbacks continue to run as before.(CVE-2025-40120)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Enforce expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility\n\nYinhao et al. recently reported:\n\n  Our fuzzer tool discovered an uninitialized pointer issue in the\n  bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() function within the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.\n  This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when a BPF program attempts to\n  deference the txq member of struct xdp_buff object.\n\nThe test initializes two programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP: progA acts as the\nentry point for bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() and its expected_attach_type can\nneither be of be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP nor BPF_XDP_CPUMAP. progA calls into a slot\nof a tailcall map it owns. progB's expected_attach_type must be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP\nto pass xdp_is_valid_access() validation. The program returns struct xdp_md's\negress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned\nexpected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA\ncalls.\n\nThe underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs\nof type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well\nas sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'\nexpected_attach_type. Similarly, a program attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET4_GETPEERNAME\nshould not be allowed doing a tailcall into a program which calls bpf_bind()\nout of BPF which is only enabled for BPF_CGROUP_INET4_CONNECT.\n\nIn short, specifying expected_attach_type allows to open up additional\nfunctionality or restrictions beyond what the basic bpf_prog_type enables.\nThe use of tailcalls must not violate these constraints. Fix it by enforcing\nexpected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().\n\nNote that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or\ncpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and\ncpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment / context and therefore\nthese situations are not prone to this issue.(CVE-2025-40123)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a vulnerability exists in the blk-mq component: the return value of blk_mq_sysfs_register_hctxs() is not checked in __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() function. If sysfs creation for hctx fails, later changing the number of hw_queues or removing disk will trigger kernel warnings. The issue occurs because kobject_del() is called unconditionally even when sysfs creation fails, leading to kernfs directory operation errors.(CVE-2025-40125)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsunrpc: fix null pointer dereference on zero-length checksum\n\nIn xdr_stream_decode_opaque_auth(), zero-length checksum.len causes\nchecksum.data to be set to NULL. This triggers a NPD when accessing\nchecksum.data in gss_krb5_verify_mic_v2(). This patch ensures that\nthe value of checksum.len is not less than XDR_UNIT.(CVE-2025-40129)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, there is a race condition between device manager (dm) suspend and table load that can lead to null pointer dereference. The issue occurs when suspend is invoked before table load completes, causing q-\u003etag_set to be a NULL pointer and leading to system crash. The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions from 5.0 to 6.17.2.(CVE-2025-40134)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a race condition vulnerability exists in the rtl8150 USB network driver's rtl8150_set_multicast function. The vulnerability occurs because rtl8150_set_multicast incorrectly calls netif_stop_queue and netif_wake_queue, causing TX queue synchronization issues. When rtl8150_set_multicast wakes up the TX queue before USB transfer completion, it may lead to double submission of URB in rtl8150_start_xmit, resulting in warnings and potential system instability.(CVE-2025-40140)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a use-after-free vulnerability has been identified in the Bluetooth ISO module. This vulnerability is similar to the issue in sco_conn_free where if conn-\u003esk is not set to NULL, it may lead to use-after-free in iso_conn_free.(CVE-2025-40141)\n\nA vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel where calling mprotect() on large hugetlb memory areas (approximately 300GB) can cause soft lockup issues. The CPU becomes stuck for extended periods, making the system unresponsive. This occurs because the hugetlb handling for large memory lacks proper scheduling opportunities, unlike THP or base pages which already have cond_resched() calls. Although the soft lockup was triggered by MTE, this is not MTE-specific - any processing that takes a long time in the loop may trigger soft lockup.(CVE-2025-40153)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the usbnet driver contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. Syzbot reported warnings about using smp_processor_id() in preemptible code. This vulnerability may lead to stack buffer overflow, affecting system confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability stems from the incorrect use of smp_processor_id() function in the usbnet_skb_return function within preemptible context.(CVE-2025-40164)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a vulnerability has been found in the ext4 filesystem. When opening a verity file on a corrupted ext4 filesystem mounted without a journal, syzbot reported a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent(). The issue is that the filesystem has an inode with both the INLINE_DATA and EXTENTS flags set. This is an invalid combination since an inode should have either: INLINE_DATA (data stored directly in the inode) or EXTENTS (data stored in extent-mapped blocks). Having both flags causes ext4_has_inline_data() to return true, skipping extent tree validation in __ext4_iget(). The unvalidated out-of-order extents then trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() due to integer underflow when calculating hole sizes.(CVE-2025-40167)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the check_alu_op() function in the BPF verifier contains a vulnerability when validating ALU operation instructions. The function validates BPF program instructions where the 'offset' field is a signed 16-bit integer. The original check condition 'insn-\u003eoff \u003e 1' was intended to ensure the offset is either 0 or 1 (for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV operations). However, since 'insn-\u003eoff' is signed, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values (e.g., -1). This vulnerability allows maliciously crafted BPF programs to bypass verification, potentially leading to privilege escalation and other security issues.(CVE-2025-40169)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a vulnerability has been found in the nvmet-fc module. When multiple async commands are in flight from __nvmet_fc_send_ls_req, a tgtport reference is taken for each command. In the current code, only one put work item is queued at a time, which results in a leaked reference. This vulnerability affects multiple Linux kernel version branches.(CVE-2025-40171)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a vulnerability has been identified in the net/ip6_tunnel module. Similar to IPv4 tunnel, IPv6 version also updates dev-\u003eneeded_headroom. While IPv4 tunnel headroom adjustment growth was limited in commit 5ae1e9922bbd, the IPv6 tunnel continues to increase headroom without any ceiling. This vulnerability may lead to perpetual tunnel growth, affecting system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, with potential privilege escalation risks.(CVE-2025-40173)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, during asynchronous decryption in the TLS module, the tls_strp_msg_hold function is called to create a clone of the input skb to hold references to the memory it uses. If the allocation of this clone fails, proceeding with asynchronous decryption can lead to various issues (UAF on the skb, writing into userspace memory after the recv() call has returned). In this case, the system should wait for all pending decryption requests to complete.(CVE-2025-40176)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, there is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the pid_nr_ns function. When task_active_pid_ns returns null, it triggers kernel panic. The vulnerability manifests as kernel panic when task_active_pid_ns returns null in the pid_nr_ns function. The vulnerability example shows inability to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference errors, leading to system crash. The specific error is 'Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000058', ultimately causing kernel panic and system crash.(CVE-2025-40178)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the ext4 filesystem has a vulnerability: orphan files can be arbitrarily large in principle. However, orphan replay needs to traverse all content and pin all buffers in memory. Filesystems with absurdly large orphan files can lead to significant memory consumption. The vulnerability limits orphan file size to a sane value and uses kvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor structures to avoid large order allocations for large orphan files.(CVE-2025-40179)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a memory leak vulnerability exists. Cilium's BPF egress gateway feature redirects K8s Pod traffic through vxlan tunnels to dedicated egress gateways. When using the bpf_redirect_neigh() helper to forward packets, vxlan allocates metadata_dst objects and attaches them to skb through fake dst entries. However, since bpf_redirect_neigh() only sets new dst entries without first dropping existing ones, the metadata_dst objects are never released, causing continuous increase in kmalloc-256 slab usage.(CVE-2025-40183)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the SCTP protocol. When new_asoc-\u003epeer.adaptation_ind=0 and sctp_ulpevent_make_authkey=0, and sctp_ulpevent_make_authkey() returns 0, the variable ai_ev remains zero and this zero value will be dereferenced in the sctp_ulpevent_free() function.(CVE-2025-40187)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, there is a reference count underflow vulnerability in the ext4 file system. Syzkaller discovered a path where ext4_xattr_inode_update_ref() reads an EA inode refcount that is already \u003c= 0 and then applies ref_change (often -1), causing the refcount to underflow and proceed with a bogus value, triggering errors like: EXT4-fs error: EA inode ref underflow, EXT4-fs warning: ea_inode dec ref err. The fix makes the invariant explicit: if the current refcount is non-positive, treat it as on-disk corruption, emit ext4_error_inode(), and fail the operation with -EFSCORRUPTED instead of updating the refcount.(CVE-2025-40190)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Revert \"ipmi: fix msg stack when IPMI is disconnected\". This patch has a subtle bug that can cause the IPMI driver to go into an infinite loop if the BMC misbehaves in a certain way. Apparently certain BMCs do misbehave this way because several reports have come in recently about this.(CVE-2025-40192)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix object lifecycle issue in update_qos_request(). The cpufreq_cpu_put() call in update_qos_request() takes place too early because the latter subsequently calls freq_qos_update_request() that indirectly accesses the policy object in question through the QoS request object passed to it. Fortunately, update_qos_request() is called under intel_pstate_driver_lock, so this issue does not matter for changing the intel_pstate operation mode, but it theoretically can cause a crash to occur on CPU device hot removal (which currently can only happen in virt, but it is formally supported nevertheless). Address this issue by modifying update_qos_request() to drop the reference to the policy later.(CVE-2025-40194)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a buffer over-read vulnerability has been discovered in the parse_apply_sb_mount_options() function of the ext4 filesystem. Unlike other strings in the ext4 superblock, this vulnerability relies on tune2fs to ensure s_mount_opts is NUL terminated. The parse_apply_sb_mount_options() function has been hardened by treating s_mount_opts as a potential __nonstring.(CVE-2025-40198)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a vulnerability has been identified in the Squashfs filesystem's squashfs_read_inode() function, which fails to properly validate input data and may accept negative file sizes. Syskaller reports a \"WARNING in ovl_copy_up_file\" in overlayfs. This warning is ultimately caused because the underlying Squashfs filesystem returns a file with a negative file size. This commit fixes the issue by checking for negative file sizes and returning EINVAL.(CVE-2025-40200)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the sys_prlimit64() path has a race condition issue with the usage of task_lock(tsk-\u003egroup_leader). When tsk != current and tsk is not a leader, this process can exit/exec and task_lock(tsk-\u003egroup_leader) may use the already freed task_struct. Another problem is that sys_prlimit64() can race with mt-exec which changes -\u003egroup_leader. In this case do_prlimit() may take the wrong lock, or (worse) -\u003egroup_leader may change between task_lock() and task_unlock(). The fix changes sys_prlimit64() to take tasklist_lock when necessary.(CVE-2025-40201)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the IPMI subsystem's user message limit handling had a number of issues, including improper counting in some cases and a use-after-free vulnerability. The vulnerability has been resolved by restructuring the handling to manage more in the receive message allocation routine, where all referencing and user message limit counts are now handled, making the process cleaner and safer. This vulnerability affects Linux Kernel versions from 5.19 to 6.18-rc1.(CVE-2025-40202)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the SCTP protocol's MAC comparison implementation was vulnerable to timing attacks. This vulnerability allows attackers to infer MAC values through timing analysis, potentially bypassing security validation. The fix modifies the MAC comparison to use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.(CVE-2025-40204)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the netfilter nft_objref module has a validation bypass vulnerability. Referencing a synproxy stateful object from OUTPUT hook causes kernel crash due to infinite recursive calls. This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger kernel stack overflow through specially crafted nftables rules, leading to system crash. Validation functions for objref and objrefmap expressions have been implemented, currently only NFT_OBJECT_SYNPROXY object type requires validation.(CVE-2025-40206)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a use-after-free vulnerability exists in the ACPI video subsystem. The switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device-\u003ebrightness and device-\u003ebacklight, which are freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight() during device removal. If the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight() frees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when acpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device-\u003ebrightness or device-\u003ebacklight. The issue is fixed by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's switch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler() after removing the notify handler that queues the work, ensuring the work completes before the memory is freed.(CVE-2025-40211)",

It first loads\nthe '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()\nand then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir\nentry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the\nsame data block.\n\nIf the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the\nsanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data\nblock) and leaves \"struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de\" point exactly past the\nmemory slot allocated to the data block.

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before\n\nCurrently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through\nvm_ops-\u003emay_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[",

In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",

That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThat pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the\ncode in question will delay the actual call to \"ep_free(ep)\" until after\nit has unlocked the mutex.\n\nBut it's wrong for the much subtler \"next to last\" case when somebody\n*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're\nstill using the mutex.\n\nNote that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep\nmutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,\neven if they guarantee mutual exclusion.\n\nA mutex \"unlock\" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still\naccessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in\nand get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the\nfirst user is still cleaning up.\n\nSee our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,\nin particular the section [1] about semantics:\n\n\t\"mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has\n\t internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for\n\t another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the\n\t mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore\"\n\nSo if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the\nlast one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops\n_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all\nwhile the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.\n\nFix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:\nthe refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's\nthe whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently\nabout object lifetimes).",

The driver's default interrupt mask setting logic is flawed, as the interrupt mask value should be completely controlled by user space. If the mask bit gets changed by the driver concurrently with user mode operating on the ring, the mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, causing the user-mode driver to miss an interrupt and leading to a system hang.\n\nSpecifically, when the driver sets the inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1, the host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel. However, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a message in the inbound ring buffer. This results in the host putting a message into the ring buffer without interruption. Subsequently, when user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 0 and waits for an interrupt via pread(), since there's already a message in the ring buffer, no new interrupt is generated, causing pread() to wait indefinitely.\n\nThe fix removes all instances where interrupt_mask is changed, while keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable user space control of the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Enforce expected_attach_type for tailcall compatibility\n\nYinhao et al. recently reported:\n\n  Our fuzzer tool discovered an uninitialized pointer issue in the\n  bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() function within the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem.\n  This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when a BPF program attempts to\n  deference the txq member of struct xdp_buff object.\n\nThe test initializes two programs of BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP: progA acts as the\nentry point for bpf_prog_test_run_xdp() and its expected_attach_type can\nneither be of be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP nor BPF_XDP_CPUMAP. progA calls into a slot\nof a tailcall map it owns. progB's expected_attach_type must be BPF_XDP_DEVMAP\nto pass xdp_is_valid_access() validation. The program returns struct xdp_md's\negress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned\nexpected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA\ncalls.\n\nThe underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs\nof type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well\nas sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'\nexpected_attach_type. Similarly, a program attached to BPF_CGROUP_INET4_GETPEERNAME\nshould not be allowed doing a tailcall into a program which calls bpf_bind()\nout of BPF which is only enabled for BPF_CGROUP_INET4_CONNECT.\n\nIn short, specifying expected_attach_type allows to open up additional\nfunctionality or restrictions beyond what the basic bpf_prog_type enables.\nThe use of tailcalls must not violate these constraints. Fix it by enforcing\nexpected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().\n\nNote that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or\ncpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and\ncpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment / context and therefore\nthese situations are not prone to this issue.",

Syzkaller discovered a path where ext4_xattr_inode_update_ref() reads an EA inode refcount that is already \u003c= 0 and then applies ref_change (often -1), causing the refcount to underflow and proceed with a bogus value, triggering errors like: EXT4-fs error: EA inode ref underflow, EXT4-fs warning: ea_inode dec ref err. The fix makes the invariant explicit: if the current refcount is non-positive, treat it as on-disk corruption, emit ext4_error_inode(), and fail the operation with -EFSCORRUPTED instead of updating the refcount.",
