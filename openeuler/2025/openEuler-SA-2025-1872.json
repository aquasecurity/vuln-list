That pointer will be used when the device is\ndone. Which could be anytime in the future.\n\nIf the user closes that file descriptor, its structure will be freed,\nand there will be one dangling pointer per pending async control, that\nthe driver will try to use.\n\nClean all the dangling pointers during release().\n\nTo avoid adding a performance penalty in the most common case (no async\noperation), a counter has been introduced with some logic to make sure\nthat it is properly handled.(CVE-2024-58002)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nibmvnic: Don't reference skb after sending to VIOS\n\nPreviously, after successfully flushing the xmit buffer to VIOS,\nthe tx_bytes stat was incremented by the length of the skb.\n\nIt is invalid to access the skb memory after sending the buffer to\nthe VIOS because, at any point after sending, the VIOS can trigger\nan interrupt to free this memory.
