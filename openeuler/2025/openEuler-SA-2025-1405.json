Assimp aims to provide a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game engines and real-time rendering systems of any kind, but is not limited to this purpose.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function Assimp::ASEImporter::BuildUniqueRepresentation of the file code/AssetLib/ASE/ASELoader.cpp of the component ASE File Handler. The manipulation of the argument mIndices leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is named 7c705fde418d68cca4e8eff56be01b2617b0d6fe. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-3015)\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This vulnerability affects the function Assimp::MDLImporter::ParseTextureColorData of the file code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLMaterialLoader.cpp of the component MDL File Handler. The manipulation of the argument mWidth/mHeight leads to resource consumption. The attack can be initiated remotely. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 5d2a7482312db2e866439a8c05a07ce1e718bed1. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-3016)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function Assimp::ASE::Parser::ParseLV4MeshBonesVertices of the file code/AssetLib/ASE/ASEParser.cpp of the component ASE File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
