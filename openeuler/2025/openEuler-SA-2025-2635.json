Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn t have a  first CPU .On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an  index that is 1 out of boundsThis does not have any security implications since flashing microcode isa privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications bypotentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashesa microcode update. I get the following splat:  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y  index 512 is out of range for type  unsigned long[512]   [...]  Call Trace:   dump_stack   __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds   load_microcode_amd   request_microcode_amd   reload_store   kernfs_fop_write_iter   vfs_write   ksys_write   do_syscall_64   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframeChange the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determiningwhether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update.  [ bp: Massage commit message, fix typo. ](CVE-2025-21991)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nopenvswitch: Fix unsafe attribute parsing in output_userspace()\n\nThis patch replaces the manual Netlink attribute iteration in\noutput_userspace() with nla_for_each_nested(), which ensures that only\nwell-formed attributes are processed.(CVE-2025-37998)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: pcl726: Prevent invalid irq number\n\nThe reproducer passed in an irq number(0x80008000) that was too large,\nwhich triggered the oob.\n\nAdded an interrupt number check to prevent users from passing in an irq\nnumber that was too large.\n\nIf `it-\u003eoptions[1]` is 31, then `1 \u003c\u003c it-\u003eoptions[1]` is still invalid\nbecause it shifts a 1-bit into the sign bit (which is UB in C).\nPossible solutions include reducing the upper bound on the\n`it-\u003eoptions[1]` value to 30 or lower, or using `1U \u003c\u003c it-\u003eoptions[1]`.\n\nThe old code would just not attempt to request the IRQ if the\n`options[1]` value were invalid.  And it would still configure the\ndevice without interrupts even if the call to `request_irq` returned an\nerror.  So it would be better to combine this test with the test below.(CVE-2025-39685)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: pfr_update: Fix the driver update version check\n\nThe security-version-number check should be used rather\nthan the runtime version check for driver updates.\n\nOtherwise, the firmware update would fail when the update binary had\na lower runtime version number than the current one.\n\n[ rjw: Changelog edits ](CVE-2025-39701)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/vmscan: fix hwpoisoned large folio handling in shrink_folio_list\n\nIn shrink_folio_list(), the hwpoisoned folio may be large folio, which\ncan't be handled by unmap_poisoned_folio().  For THP, try_to_unmap_one()\nmust be passed with TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD to split huge PMD first and then\nretry.  Without TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger null-ptr deref of\npvmw.pte.  Even we passed TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger a\nWARN_ON_ONCE due to the page isn't in swapcache.\n\nSince UCE is rare in real world, and race with reclaimation is more rare,\njust skipping the hwpoisoned large folio is enough.  memory_failure() will\nhandle it if the UCE is triggered again.\n\nThis happens when memory reclaim for large folio races with\nmemory_failure(), and will lead to kernel panic.  The race is as\nfollows:\n\ncpu0      cpu1\n shrink_folio_list memory_failure\n  TestSetPageHWPoison\n  unmap_poisoned_folio\n  --\u003e trigger BUG_ON due to\n  unmap_poisoned_folio couldn't\n   handle large folio\n\n[(CVE-2025-39725)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA: hfi1: fix possible divide-by-zero in find_hw_thread_mask()\n\nThe function divides number of online CPUs by num_core_siblings, and\nlater checks the divider by zero. This implies a possibility to get\nand divide-by-zero runtime error. Fix it by moving the check prior to\ndivision. This also helps to save one indentation level.(CVE-2025-39742)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njbd2: prevent softlockup in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()\n\nBoth jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() and jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list()\nperiodically release j_list_lock after processing a batch of buffers to\navoid long hold times on the j_list_lock. However, since both functions\ncontend for j_list_lock, the combined time spent waiting and processing\ncan be significant.\n\njbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list() explicitly calls cond_resched() when\nneed_resched() is true to avoid softlockups during prolonged operations.\nBut jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() only exits its loop when need_resched() is\ntrue, relying on potentially sleeping functions like __flush_batch() or\nwait_on_buffer() to trigger rescheduling. If those functions do not sleep,\nthe kernel may hit a softlockup.\n\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 156s!

Additionally, the delayed work\nitem is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only\nblocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the\nworkqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after\nflush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the\nflush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have\nfinished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.\nThis leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated\nby cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to\ndereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\ncnic_netdev_event()          |\n  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()\n    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...\n      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()\n      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/\n                             | queue_delayed_work()\n  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance\n                             |   dev = cp-\u003edev; //use\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any\nongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is\ndeallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses\n__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently\nexecuting instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()\nbecomes redundant and should be removed.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue\nand validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and\nintroduced intentional delays — such as inserting calls to ssleep()\nwithin the cnic_delete_task() function — to increase the likelihood\nof triggering the bug.(CVE-2025-39945)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nqed: Don't collect too many protection override GRC elements\n\nIn the protection override dump path, the firmware can return far too\nmany GRC elements, resulting in attempting to write past the end of the\npreviously-kmalloc'ed dump buffer.\n\nThis will result in a kernel panic with reason:\n\n BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ADDRESS\n\nwhere \"ADDRESS\" is just past the end of the protection override dump\nbuffer.

The maximum number of descriptors supported by the\nhardware is 8k-32.\nAdditionally, enforce alignment constraints: Tx rings must be a multiple\nof 8, and Rx rings must be a multiple of 32.(CVE-2025-39973)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfutex: Prevent use-after-free during requeue-PI\n\nsyzbot managed to trigger the following race:\n\n   T1                               T2\n\n futex_wait_requeue_pi()\n   futex_do_wait()\n     schedule()\n                               futex_requeue()\n                                 futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()\n                                   futex_requeue_pi_prepare()\n                                   requeue_pi_wake_futex()\n                                     futex_requeue_pi_complete()\n                                      /* preempt */\n\n         * timeout/ signal wakes T1 *\n\n   futex_requeue_pi_wakeup_sync() // Q_REQUEUE_PI_LOCKED\n   futex_hash_put()\n  // back to userland, on stack futex_q is garbage\n\n                                      /* back */\n                                     wake_up_state(q-\u003etask, TASK_NORMAL);\n\nIn this scenario futex_wait_requeue_pi() is able to leave without using\nfutex_q::lock_ptr for synchronization.\n\nThis can be prevented by reading futex_q::task before updating the\nfutex_q::requeue_state. A reference on the task_struct is not needed\nbecause requeue_pi_wake_futex() is invoked with a spinlock_t held which\nimplies a RCU read section.\n\nEven if T1 terminates immediately after, the task_struct will remain valid\nduring T2's wake_up_state().  A READ_ONCE on futex_q::task before\nfutex_requeue_pi_complete() is enough because it ensures that the variable\nis read before the state is updated.\n\nRead futex_q::task before updating the requeue state, use it for the\nfollowing wakeup.(CVE-2025-39977)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a race condition vulnerability exists in the mm/hugetlb subsystem. Migration may race with fallocating hole operations. The remove_inode_single_folio function checks if the folio is still mapped without holding the folio lock. If the folio is migrated and the mapped page table entry has been converted to a migration entry, folio_mapped() returns false and fails to unmap it. Due to the extra refcount held by remove_inode_single_folio, migration fails, restores the migration entry to a normal page table entry, and the folio is mapped again, ultimately triggering a BUG in filemap_unaccount_folio.(CVE-2025-40006)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tracing: dynevent: Add a missing lockdown check on dyneventSince dynamic_events interface on tracefs is compatible withkprobe_events and uprobe_events, it should also check the lockdownstatus and reject if it is set.(CVE-2025-40021)\n\nThere is a critical race condition in kprobe initialization in the Linux kernel that can lead to NULL pointer dereference and kernel crash.Vulnerability Analysis:The race condition occurs between kprobe activation and perf_events initialization. When CPU0 executes kprobe initialization and enables kprobe functionality, CPU1 may trigger a debug exception during this period and attempt to access the perf_events pointer that has not been initialized yet, resulting in NULL pointer dereference.Technical Details:In kernel/trace/trace_kprobe.c at line 1308, the kprobe_perf_func function attempts to access the call-\u003eperf_events pointer, but due to the race condition, this pointer may not have been properly initialized.(CVE-2025-40042)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, a vulnerability has been identified in the PTP (Precision Time Protocol) subsystem. syzbot reported a WARNING in max_vclocks_store function. This occurs when the max argument is too large for kcalloc to handle, leading to potential buffer overflow. The vulnerability is resolved by adding an upper bound on max_vclocks.(CVE-2025-40057)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tty: n_gsm: Don t block input queue by waiting MSCCurrently gsm_queue() processes incoming frames and when opening a DLC channel it calls gsm_dlci_open() which calls gsm_modem_update(). If basic mode is used it calls gsm_modem_upd_via_msc() and it cannot block the input queue by waiting the response to come into the same input queue.Instead allow sending Modem Status Command without waiting for remote end to respond. Define a new function gsm_modem_send_initial_msc() for this purpose. As MSC is only valid for basic encoding, it does not do anything for advanced or when convergence layer type 2 is used.(CVE-2025-40071)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the arm_spe component of the perf subsystem. The PERF_IDX2OFF() function does not properly cast to unsigned long when handling large AUX buffer sizes (\u003e= 2 GiB), which may lead to integer overflow.(CVE-2025-40081)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: KVM: arm64: Prevent access to vCPU events before init. KVM erroneously allows userspace to pend vCPU events for a vCPU that hasn t been initialized yet, leading to KVM interpreting a bunch of uninitialized garbage for routing / injecting the exception. In one case the injection code and the hyp disagree on whether the vCPU has a 32bit EL1 and put the vCPU into an illegal mode for AArch64, tripping the BUG() in exception_target_el() during the next injection. Reject the ioctls outright as no sane VMM would call these before KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT anyway.(CVE-2025-40102)",

      "Note": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncnic: Fix use-after-free bugs in cnic_delete_task\n\nThe original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw(),\nwhich does not guarantee that the delayed work item 'delete_task' has\nfully completed if it was already running. Additionally, the delayed work\nitem is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only\nblocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the\nworkqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after\nflush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the\nflush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have\nfinished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.\nThis leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated\nby cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to\ndereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\ncnic_netdev_event()          |\n  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()\n    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...\n      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()\n      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/\n                             | queue_delayed_work()\n  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance\n                             |   dev = cp-\u003edev; //use\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any\nongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is\ndeallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses\n__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently\nexecuting instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()\nbecomes redundant and should be removed.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue\nand validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and\nintroduced intentional delays — such as inserting calls to ssleep()\nwithin the cnic_delete_task() function — to increase the likelihood\nof triggering the bug.",
