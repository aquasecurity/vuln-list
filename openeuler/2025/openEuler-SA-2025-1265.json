      "Text": "Mozilla Firefox is a standalone web browser, designed for standards compliance and performance.  Its functionality can be enhanced via a plethora of extensions.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nWhen loading a script with Subresource Integrity, attackers with an injection capability could trigger the reuse of previously cached entries with incorrect, different integrity metadata. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 103.(CVE-2022-36315)\n\nWhen using the Performance API, an attacker was able to notice subtle differences between PerformanceEntries and thus learn whether the target URL had been subject to a redirect. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 103.(CVE-2022-36316)\n\nAn attacker could have written a value to the first element in a zero-length JavaScript array. Although the array was zero-length, the value was not written to an invalid memory address. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 104.(CVE-2022-38475)\n\nService Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which could have led to Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing Mode. This would not have persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would have leaked Private Browsing Mode details to disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 107.(CVE-2022-45417)\n\nIf the user added a security exception for an invalid TLS certificate, opened an ongoing TLS connection with a server that used that certificate, and then deleted the exception, Firefox would have kept the connection alive, making it seem like the certificate was still trusted. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 107.(CVE-2022-45419)\n\nMozilla developers and community members Lukas Bernhard, Gabriele Svelto, Randell Jesup, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 107. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 108.(CVE-2022-46879)\n\nMozilla developers Gabriele Svelto, Yulia Startsev, Andrew McCreight and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\u003cbr /\u003e*Note*: This advisory was added on December 13th, 2022 after discovering it was inadvertently left out of the original advisory. The fix was included in the original release of Firefox 107. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 107.(CVE-2022-46883)\n\nDue to URL previews in the network panel of developer tools improperly storing URLs, query parameters could potentially be used to overwrite global objects in privileged code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 110.(CVE-2023-25731)\n\nThe return value from `gfx::SourceSurfaceSkia::Map()` wasn't being verified which could have potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 110.(CVE-2023-25733)\n\nAn invalid downcast from `nsHTMLDocument` to `nsIContent` could have lead to undefined behavior. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 110.(CVE-2023-25736)\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a ServiceWorker's offline cache may have leaked to the file system when using private browsing mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 111.(CVE-2023-25750)\n\nWhen following a redirect to a publicly accessible web extension file, the URL may have been translated to the actual local path, leaking potentially sensitive information. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 111.(CVE-2023-28160)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 110. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 111.(CVE-2023-28177)\n\nMultiple race conditions in the font initialization could have led to memory corruption and execution of attacker-controlled code. This vulnerability affects Firefox for Android \u003c 112, Firefox \u003c 112, and Focus for Android \u003c 112.(CVE-2023-29537)\n\nUnder specific circumstances a WebExtension may have received a \u003ccode\u003ejar:file:///\u003c/code\u003e URI instead of a \u003ccode\u003emoz-extension:///\u003c/code\u003e URI during a load request. This leaked directory paths on the user's machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox for Android \u003c 112, Firefox \u003c 112, and Focus for Android \u003c 112.(CVE-2023-29538)\n\nUsing a redirect embedded into \u003ccode\u003esourceMappingUrls\u003c/code\u003e could allow for navigation to external protocol links in sandboxed iframes without \u003ccode\u003eallow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols\u003c/code\u003e. This vulnerability affects Firefox for Android \u003c 112, Firefox \u003c 112, and Focus for Android \u003c 112.(CVE-2023-29540)\n\nWhen a secure cookie existed in the Firefox cookie jar an insecure cookie for the same domain could have been created, when it should have silently failed. This could have led to a desynchronization in expected results when reading from the secure cookie. This vulnerability affects Firefox for Android \u003c 112, Firefox \u003c 112, and Focus for Android \u003c 112.(CVE-2023-29547)\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a call to the \u003ccode\u003ebind\u003c/code\u003e function may have resulted in the incorrect realm. This may have created a vulnerability relating to JavaScript-implemented sandboxes such as SES. This vulnerability affects Firefox for Android \u003c 112, Firefox \u003c 112, and Focus for Android \u003c 112.(CVE-2023-29549)\n\nService workers could reveal script base URL due to dynamic `import()`. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 113.(CVE-2023-32208)\n\nA maliciously crafted favicon could have led to an out of memory crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 113.(CVE-2023-32209)\n\nDocuments were incorrectly assuming an ordering of principal objects when ensuring we were loading an appropriately privileged principal. In certain circumstances it might have been possible to cause a document to be loaded with a higher privileged principal than intended. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 113.(CVE-2023-32210)\n\nWhen choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a data: URL that was the result of a redirect, Firefox would load that document in the same process as the site that issued the redirect. This bypassed the site-isolation protections against Spectre-like attacks on sites that host an \"open redirect\". Firefox no longer follows HTTP redirects to data: URLs. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 114.(CVE-2023-34415)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 113. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 114.(CVE-2023-34417)\n\nWhen Firefox is configured to block storage of all cookies, it was still possible to store data in localstorage by using an iframe with a source of 'about:blank'. This could have led to malicious websites storing tracking data without permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-3482)\n\nDuring the worker lifecycle, a use-after-free condition could have occured, which could have led to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.0.2, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.0.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.0.1.(CVE-2023-3600)\n\nInsufficient validation in the Drag and Drop API in conjunction with social engineering, may have allowed an attacker to trick end-users into creating a shortcut to local system files.  This could have been leveraged to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37203)\n\nA website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using an option element by introducing lag via an expensive computational function. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37204)\n\nThe use of RTL Arabic characters in the address bar may have allowed for URL spoofing. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37205)\n\nUploading files which contain symlinks may have allowed an attacker to trick a user into submitting sensitive data to a malicious website. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37206)\n\nA use-after-free condition existed in `NotifyOnHistoryReload` where a `LoadingSessionHistoryEntry` object was freed and a reference to that object remained.  This resulted in a potentially exploitable condition when the reference to that object was later reused. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37209)\n\nA website could prevent a user from exiting full-screen mode via alert and prompt calls.  This could lead to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37210)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 114. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.(CVE-2023-37212)\n\nA website could have obscured the full screen notification by using the file open dialog. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4051)\n\nA website could have obscured the full screen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4053)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116.(CVE-2023-4058)\n\nWhen `UpdateRegExpStatics` attempted to access `initialStringHeap` it could already have been garbage collected prior to entering the function, which could potentially have led to an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4577)\n\nWhen calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax` a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4578)\n\nSearch queries in the default search engine could appear to have been the currently navigated URL if the search query itself was a well formed URL. This could have led to a site spoofing another if it had been maliciously set as the default search engine. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117.(CVE-2023-4579)\n\nPush notifications stored on disk in private browsing mode were not being encrypted potentially allowing the leak of sensitive information. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4580)\n\nDue to large allocation checks in Angle for glsl shaders being too lenient a buffer overflow could have occured when allocating too much private shader memory on mac OS. \n*This bug only affects Firefox on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4582)\n\nWhen checking if the Browsing Context had been discarded in `HttpBaseChannel`, if the load group was not available then it was assumed to have already been discarded which was not always the case for private channels after the private session had ended. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.(CVE-2023-4583)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 115.1, and Thunderbird 115.1.

This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 118, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.3.(CVE-2023-5169)\n\nIn canvas rendering, a compromised content process could have caused a surface to change unexpectedly, leading to a memory leak of a privileged process. This memory leak could be used to effect a sandbox escape if the correct data was leaked. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 118.(CVE-2023-5170)\n\nDuring Ion compilation, a Garbage Collection could have resulted in a use-after-free condition, allowing an attacker to write two NUL bytes, and cause a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 118, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.3.(CVE-2023-5171)\n\nA hashtable  in the Ion Engine could have been mutated while there was a live interior reference, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 118.(CVE-2023-5172)\n\nIn a non-standard configuration of Firefox, an integer overflow could have occurred based on network traffic (possibly under influence of a local unprivileged webpage), leading to an out-of-bounds write to privileged process memory. \n*This bug only affects Firefox if a non-standard preference allowing non-HTTPS Alternate Services (`network.http.altsvc.oe`) is enabled.* This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 118.(CVE-2023-5173)\n\nDuring process shutdown, it was possible that an `ImageBitmap` was created that would later be used after being freed from a different codepath, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.
