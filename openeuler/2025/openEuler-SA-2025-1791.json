      "Text": "Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nPython is an open source, object-oriented programming language from the Python Foundation. This language has the characteristics of scalability, supporting modules and packages, and supporting multiple platforms.\n There is a security vulnerability in Python 3.12 and later versions. This vulnerability originates from the tarfile module extraction filter function that allows modifying file metadata and permissions outside the extract directory.(CVE-2024-12718)\n\nA vulnerability classified as critical was found in Python CPython up to 3.14.0b1 (Programming Language Software).The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-22. The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality.Upgrading to version 3.14.0b2 eliminates this vulnerability. Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at github.com. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.(CVE-2025-4138)\n\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Python CPython up to 3.14.0b1 (Programming Language Software).Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-22.
