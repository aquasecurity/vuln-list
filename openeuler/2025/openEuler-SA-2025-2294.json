      "Text": "The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete control of the client is made by the programmer. With libssh, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from openssl).\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThere's a vulnerability in the libssh package where when a libssh consumer passes in an unexpectedly large input buffer to ssh_get_fingerprint_hash() function. In such cases the bin_to_base64() function can experience an integer overflow leading to a memory under allocation, when that happens it's possible that the program perform out of bounds write leading to a heap corruption. This issue affects only 32-bits builds of libssh.(CVE-2025-4877)\n\nA vulnerability was found in libssh, where an uninitialized variable exists under certain conditions in the privatekey_from_file() function. This flaw can be triggered if the file specified by the filename doesn't exist and may lead to possible signing failures or heap corruption.(CVE-2025-4878)\n\nA flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.(CVE-2025-5351)\n\nA flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2025-5372)",
