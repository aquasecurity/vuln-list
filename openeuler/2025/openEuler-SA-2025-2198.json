      "Text": "Use ImageMagick to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, GIF, HEIC, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 6.9.13-27 and 7.1.2-1, the magnified size calculations in ReadOneMNGIMage (in coders/png.c) are unsafe and can overflow, leading to memory corruption. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-27 and 7.1.2-1.(CVE-2025-55154)\n\nImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 6.9.13-27 and 7.1.2-1, there is undefined behavior (function-type-mismatch) in splay tree cloning callback. This results in a deterministic abort under UBSan (DoS in sanitizer builds), with no crash in a non-sanitized build. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-27 and 7.1.2-1.(CVE-2025-55160)\n\nA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in ImageMagick up to 6.9.13-27/7.1.2-1 (Image Processing Software).The manipulation of the argument width/height with an unknown input leads to a unknown weakness. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-369. The product divides a value by zero.As an impact it is known to affect availability.Upgrading to version 6.9.13-28 or 7.1.2-2 eliminates this vulnerability. The upgrade is hosted for download at github.com. Applying the patch 5f0bcf986b8b5e90567750d31a37af502b73f2af is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at github.com. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.(CVE-2025-55212)\n\nA vulnerability was found in ImageMagick up to 6.9.13-27/7.1.2-1 (Image Processing Software).
