The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs.Impacted is integrity.Upgrading to version 0.19.2 eliminates this vulnerability. The upgrade is hosted for download at github.com. Applying the patch 64c8f32b0349c33fb8382784af468338078851f9 is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at github.com. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.(CVE-2025-54389)\n\nAIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.(CVE-2025-54409)",
