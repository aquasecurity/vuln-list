The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.This is going to have an impact on availability.Upgrading to version 0.28.6 eliminates this vulnerability. Applying the patch e737332427711f15bcdc4e903203d6b7493eaec0 is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at github.com. The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.(CVE-2025-54080)\n\nA vulnerability was found in exiv2 up to 0.28.5 (Image Processing Software).
