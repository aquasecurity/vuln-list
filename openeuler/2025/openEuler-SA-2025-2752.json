      "Text": "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability.  It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nAn overly broad default permission vulnerability was found in containerd.\n\n- `/var/lib/containerd` was created with the permission bits 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n  - Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the metadata store and the content store\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri` was created with 0o755, while it should be created with 0o700\n  - Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the contents of Kubernetes local volumes. The contents of volumes might include setuid binaries, which could allow a local user on the host to elevate privileges on the host.\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim` was created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n\nThe directory paths may differ depending on the daemon configuration.\nWhen the `temp` directory path is specified in the daemon configuration, that directory was also created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700.(CVE-2024-25621)\n\nA bug was found in containerd's CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine leaks. Repetitive calls of CRI Attach (e.g., kubectl attach) could increase the memory usage of containerd.(CVE-2025-64329)",
