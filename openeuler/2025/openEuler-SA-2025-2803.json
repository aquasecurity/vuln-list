In the current\nimplementation, the block_device structure is set after the function\nreturns to the caller.\n\nHere, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer\nhead as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the\ncaller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it\nwas reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call\ntouch_buffer() here in the first place.\n\nSo this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.(CVE-2024-53131)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm: adv7511: Fix use-after-free in adv7533_attach_dsi()The host_node pointer was assigned and freed in adv7533_parse_dt(), andlater, adv7533_attach_dsi() uses the same. Fix this use-after-free issueby dropping of_node_put() in adv7533_parse_dt() and calling of_node_put()in error path of probe() and also in the remove().(CVE-2024-57887)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ila: serialize calls to nf_register_net_hooks()syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]commit 031ae72825ce ( ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner )attempted to fix a similar issue.Looking at the syzbot repro, we have concurrent ILA_CMD_ADD commands.Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().[1] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rht_key_hashfn include/linux/rhashtable.h:159 [inline] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __rhashtable_lookup.constprop.0+0x426/0x550 include/linux/rhashtable.h:604Read of size 4 at addr ffff888028f40008 by task dhcpcd/5501CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 5501 Comm: dhcpcd Not tainted 6.13.0-rc4-syzkaller-00054-gd6ef8b40d075 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024Call Trace: \u003cIRQ\u003e  __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]  dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120  print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:378 [inline]  print_report+0xc3/0x620 mm/kasan/report.c:489  kasan_report+0xd9/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:602  rht_key_hashfn include/linux/rhashtable.h:159 [inline]  __rhashtable_lookup.constprop.0+0x426/0x550 include/linux/rhashtable.h:604  rhashtable_lookup include/linux/rhashtable.h:646 [inline]  rhashtable_lookup_fast include/linux/rhashtable.h:672 [inline]  ila_lookup_wildcards net/ipv6/ila/ila_xlat.c:127 [inline]  ila_xlat_addr net/ipv6/ila/ila_xlat.c:652 [inline]  ila_nf_input+0x1ee/0x620 net/ipv6/ila/ila_xlat.c:185  nf_hook_entry_hookfn include/linux/netfilter.h:154 [inline]  nf_hook_slow+0xbb/0x200 net/netfilter/core.c:626  nf_hook.constprop.0+0x42e/0x750 include/linux/netfilter.h:269  NF_HOOK include/linux/netfilter.h:312 [inline]  ipv6_rcv+0xa4/0x680 net/ipv6/ip6_input.c:309  __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0x12e/0x1e0 net/core/dev.c:5672  __netif_receive_skb+0x1d/0x160 net/core/dev.c:5785  process_backlog+0x443/0x15f0 net/core/dev.c:6117  __napi_poll.constprop.0+0xb7/0x550 net/core/dev.c:6883  napi_poll net/core/dev.c:6952 [inline]  net_rx_action+0xa94/0x1010 net/core/dev.c:7074  handle_softirqs+0x213/0x8f0 kernel/softirq.c:561  __do_softirq kernel/softirq.c:595 [inline]  invoke_softirq kernel/softirq.c:435 [inline]  __irq_exit_rcu+0x109/0x170 kernel/softirq.c:662  irq_exit_rcu+0x9/0x30 kernel/softirq.c:678  instr_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1049 [inline]  sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0xa4/0xc0 arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1049(CVE-2024-57900)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: add check read-only before txBeginAnon() call\n\nAdded a read-only check before calling `txBeginAnon` in `extAlloc`\nand `extRecord`.

Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring\nsegment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was\nreceived when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:\n\n[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0\n[ 1.042120] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000]\n[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]\n\nIt gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to\nthe HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a\nzero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in\npage at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.\n\n[ 7.041671] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0\n[ 7.041999] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0\n[ 7.042011] xhci_hcd: WARN: buffer overrun event for slot 1 ep 2 on endpoint\n[ 7.042028] xhci_hcd: All TDs skipped for slot 1 ep 2.

Was it\ncaused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk\nwas working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to\nstarve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs\nshared one x1 slot by means of a commercial \"PCIe splitter\" board.\n\n[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd\n[ 7.178990] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 UNKNOWN(0x2003) Result: hostbyte=0x07 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK cmd_age=0s\n[ 7.179001] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: opcode=0x28 28 00 04 02 ae 00 00 02 00 00\n[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0\n\nFortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting\nthe chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are\nknown which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if\nit's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.\n\nThe bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports\ntens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining\nLink TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.\n\nNo ne\n---truncated---(CVE-2025-22022)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: put dl_stid if fail to queue dl_recall\n\nBefore calling nfsd4_run_cb to queue dl_recall to the callback_wq, we\nincrement the reference count of dl_stid.\nWe expect that after the corresponding work_struct is processed, the\nreference count of dl_stid will be decremented through the callback\nfunction nfsd4_cb_recall_release.\nHowever, if the call to nfsd4_run_cb fails, the incremented reference\ncount of dl_stid will not be decremented correspondingly, leading to the\nfollowing nfs4_stid leak:\nunreferenced object 0xffff88812067b578 (size 344):\n  comm \"nfsd\", pid 2761, jiffies 4295044002 (age 5541.241s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    01 00 00 00 6b 6b 6b 6b b8 02 c0 e2 81 88 ff ff  ....kkkk........\n    00 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 00 00 00 00 ad 4e ad de  .kkkkkkk.....N..\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc+0x4b9/0x700\n    nfsd4_process_open1+0x34/0x300\n    nfsd4_open+0x2d1/0x9d0\n    nfsd4_proc_compound+0x7a2/0xe30\n    nfsd_dispatch+0x241/0x3e0\n    svc_process_common+0x5d3/0xcc0\n    svc_process+0x2a3/0x320\n    nfsd+0x180/0x2e0\n    kthread+0x199/0x1d0\n    ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n    ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881499f4d28 (size 368):\n  comm \"nfsd\", pid 2761, jiffies 4295044005 (age 5541.239s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 30 4d 9f 49 81 88 ff ff  ........0M.I....\n    30 4d 9f 49 81 88 ff ff 20 00 00 00 01 00 00 00  0M.I.... .......\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc+0x4b9/0x700\n    nfs4_alloc_stid+0x29/0x210\n    alloc_init_deleg+0x92/0x2e0\n    nfs4_set_delegation+0x284/0xc00\n    nfs4_open_delegation+0x216/0x3f0\n    nfsd4_process_open2+0x2b3/0xee0\n    nfsd4_open+0x770/0x9d0\n    nfsd4_proc_compound+0x7a2/0xe30\n    nfsd_dispatch+0x241/0x3e0\n    svc_process_common+0x5d3/0xcc0\n    svc_process+0x2a3/0x320\n    nfsd+0x180/0x2e0\n    kthread+0x199/0x1d0\n    ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n    ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\nFix it by checking the result of nfsd4_run_cb and call nfs4_put_stid if\nfail to queue dl_recall.(CVE-2025-22025)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: don't ignore the return code of svc_proc_register()\n\nCurrently, nfsd_proc_stat_init() ignores the return value of\nsvc_proc_register(). If the procfile creation fails, then the kernel\nwill WARN when it tries to remove the entry later.\n\nFix nfsd_proc_stat_init() to return the same type of pointer as\nsvc_proc_register(), and fix up nfsd_net_init() to check that and fail\nthe nfsd_net construction if it occurs.\n\nsvc_proc_register() can fail if the dentry can't be allocated, or if an\nidentical dentry already exists. The second case is pretty unlikely in\nthe nfsd_net construction codepath, so if this happens, return -ENOMEM.(CVE-2025-22026)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix overflow in dacloffset bounds check\n\nThe dacloffset field was originally typed as int and used in an\nunchecked addition, which could overflow and bypass the existing\nbounds check in both smb_check_perm_dacl() and smb_inherit_dacl().\n\nThis could result in out-of-bounds memory access and a kernel crash\nwhen dereferencing the DACL pointer.\n\nThis patch converts dacloffset to unsigned int and uses\ncheck_add_overflow() to validate access to the DACL.(CVE-2025-22039)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: add bounds check for create lease context\n\nAdd missing bounds check for create lease context.(CVE-2025-22042)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: add bounds check for durable handle context\n\nAdd missing bounds check for durable handle context.(CVE-2025-22043)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath11k: update channel list in reg notifier instead reg worker\n\nCurrently when ath11k gets a new channel list, it will be processed\naccording to the following steps:\n1. update new channel list to cfg80211 and queue reg_work.\n2. cfg80211 handles new channel list during reg_work.\n3. update cfg80211's handled channel list to firmware by\nath11k_reg_update_chan_list().\n\nBut ath11k will immediately execute step 3 after reg_work is just\nqueued. Since step 2 is asynchronous, cfg80211 may not have completed\nhandling the new channel list, which may leading to an out-of-bounds\nwrite error:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ath11k_reg_update_chan_list\nCall Trace:\n    ath11k_reg_update_chan_list+0xbfe/0xfe0 [ath11k]\n    kfree+0x109/0x3a0\n    ath11k_regd_update+0x1cf/0x350 [ath11k]\n    ath11k_regd_update_work+0x14/0x20 [ath11k]\n    process_one_work+0xe35/0x14c0\n\nShould ensure step 2 is completely done before executing step 3.

This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus\nmake an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not\nexpect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the\nclass eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThe referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC\ncase by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to\nbe incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.\nThe following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:\n\n    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr\n    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole\n\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n\nSince backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale\nclass pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes\na different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch\nensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when\nthe child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of\nqdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or\nqdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing\nthe following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note\nthat this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This\nis not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the\nclassful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.(CVE-2025-38350)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Check dce_hwseq before dereferencing it\n\n[WHAT]\n\nhws was checked for null earlier in dce110_blank_stream, indicating hws\ncan be null, and should be checked whenever it is used.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 79db43611ff61280b6de58ce1305e0b2ecf675ad)(CVE-2025-38361)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnbd: fix uaf in nbd_genl_connect() error path\n\nThere is a use-after-free issue in nbd:\n\nblock nbd6: Receive control failed (result -104)\nblock nbd6: shutting down sockets\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in recv_work+0x694/0xa80 drivers/block/nbd.c:1022\nWrite of size 4 at addr ffff8880295de478 by task kworker/u33:0/67\n\nCPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 67 Comm: kworker/u33:0 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc5-syzkaller-00123-g2c89c1b655c0 #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-debian-1.16.3-2~bpo12+1 04/01/2014\nWorkqueue: nbd6-recv recv_work\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:408 [inline]\n print_report+0xc3/0x670 mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report+0xe0/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:634\n check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline]\n kasan_check_range+0xef/0x1a0 mm/kasan/generic.c:189\n instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:96 [inline]\n atomic_dec include/linux/atomic/atomic-instrumented.h:592 [inline]\n recv_work+0x694/0xa80 drivers/block/nbd.c:1022\n process_one_work+0x9cc/0x1b70 kernel/workqueue.c:3238\n process_scheduled_works kernel/workqueue.c:3319 [inline]\n worker_thread+0x6c8/0xf10 kernel/workqueue.c:3400\n kthread+0x3c2/0x780 kernel/kthread.c:464\n ret_from_fork+0x45/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:153\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:245\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nnbd_genl_connect() does not properly stop the device on certain\nerror paths after nbd_start_device() has been called.

However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/(CVE-2025-38457)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: vlan: fix VLAN 0 refcount imbalance of toggling filtering during runtime\n\nAssuming the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature is enabled on a net device, the\n8021q module will automatically add or remove VLAN 0 when the net device\nis put administratively up or down, respectively. There are a couple of\nproblems with the above scheme.\n\nThe first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled while the device is running:\n\n # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0\n # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off\n # ip link del dev bond1\n\nWhen the device is put administratively down the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the\nmemory will be leaked [1].\n\nAnother problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically\ndelete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not\nadding it when the device was put administratively up since during that\ntime the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or\nbug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount\nimbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:\n\n$ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0\n$ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off\n$ ifconfig bond0 up\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on\n$ ifconfig bond0 down\n$ ip link del vlan0\n\nRoot cause is as below:\nstep1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team.\nregister_vlan_dev\n    vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1\nstep2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev\nstep3: change filter from 0 to 1\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_filter_push_vids\n        ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0\nstep4: real_dev down\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0\n        vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0\nstep5: delete vlan0\nunregister_vlan_dev\n    BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null\n\nFix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was\nautomatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it\nshould be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the\n\"rx-vlan-filter\" feature.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880068e3100 (size 256):\n  comm \"ip\", pid 384, jiffies 4296130254\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 20 30 0d 80 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  . 0.............\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace (crc 81ce31fa):\n    __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2b5/0x340\n    vlan_vid_add+0x434/0x940\n    vlan_device_event.cold+0x75/0xa8\n    notifier_call_chain+0xca/0x150\n    __dev_notify_flags+0xe3/0x250\n    rtnl_configure_link+0x193/0x260\n    rtnl_newlink_create+0x383/0x8e0\n    __rtnl_newlink+0x22c/0xa40\n    rtnl_newlink+0x627/0xb00\n    rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x6fb/0xb70\n    netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x350\n    netlink_unicast+0x426/0x710\n    netlink_sendmsg+0x75a/0xc20\n    __sock_sendmsg+0xc1/0x150\n    ____sys_sendmsg+0x5aa/0x7b0\n    ___sys_sendmsg+0xfc/0x180\n\n[2]\nkernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.c:99!\nOops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 382 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.16.0-rc3 #61 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),\nBIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:unregister_vlan_dev (net/8021q/vlan.c:99 (discriminator 1))\nRSP: 0018:ffff88810badf310 EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88810da84000 RCX: ffffffffb47ceb9a\nRDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: ffff88810e8b43c8\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: fffffbfff6cefe80\nR10: ffffffffb677f407 R11: ffff88810badf3c0 R12: ffff88810e8b4000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffff88810642a5c0 R15: 000000000000017e\nFS:  00007f1ff68c20c0(0000) GS:ffff888163a24000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f1ff5dad240 CR3: 0000000107e56000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\n---truncated---(CVE-2025-38470)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_qfq: Fix race condition on qfq_aggregate\n\nA race condition can occur when 'agg' is modified in qfq_change_agg\n(called during qfq_enqueue) while other threads access it\nconcurrently.

As soon as it encounters a TLS control\nmessage, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a\nkvec backed msg buffer and read in the control message such as a\nTLS alert. Msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of\nthe copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling\ninto the tls_alert_recv.(CVE-2025-38566)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()\n\nWhile testing prior patch, I was able to trigger\nan infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:\n\nlist_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, \u0026f6i-\u003efib6_siblings,\n\t\t\tfib6_siblings) {\n\trt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling-\u003efib6_nh, \u0026nexthop_len);\n}\n\nThis is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()\nuses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,\nbecause they might no longer see the head of the list.\n\nRestart the loop if f6i-\u003efib6_nsiblings is zero.(CVE-2025-38588)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion\n\nEnsure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than\nEP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.\n\nCurrently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and\ndoes some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't\nlimit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:\n\n - They don't look upwards in the tree.\n - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of\n   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit\n   28d82dc1c4ed (\"epoll: limit paths\").\n\nEssentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just\nserves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.\n\nA more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph\nedge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no\npaths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5\nedges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.\n\nAs a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,\ntested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may\nhave changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 (\"eventpoll: Fix priority inversion\nproblem\").)\n\nTo fix it:\n\n1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,\nand use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree\nhas already been visited.\n2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum\ndepth of an upwards walk.\n3. In ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length\nbetween epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges.(CVE-2025-38614)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()\n\nWhen packet_set_ring() releases po-\u003ebind_lock, another thread can\nrun packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.\n\nThis race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7\n(\"net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()\").\n\nThere too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a\npo-\u003ebind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released.

The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.(CVE-2025-39677)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Fix use of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()\n\nsyzbot reports a KMSAN kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel\nbuffer is allocated to hold `insn-\u003en` samples (each of which is an\n`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn-\u003en` samples are\ncopied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The\nproblem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return\ndata to userspace fill in the whole `insn-\u003en` samples, so that there is\nan information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at\nthe time of writing.\n\nOne culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have\na specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`\nhandler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if\n`insn-\u003en` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn-\u003en - 1` samples copied\nto userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.\n\nAnother culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the \"vm80xx\" driver.  It\nnever returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.\n\nFix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure\nthat uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before\nhandling each instruction.\n\nThanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix\nreplaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not\nalways necessary to clear the whole buffer.(CVE-2025-39684)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write\n\nAfter nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is\nstill attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to\nnfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the\npage group.\nThe reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't\nnecessarily have a lock on the page group head.\n\nSo in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in\nnfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the\nrequest in nfs_inode_remove_request().(CVE-2025-39697)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown\n\nbnxt_set_dflt_rings() assumes that it is always called before any TC has\nbeen created.

The value 0x00 is\nreserved for undefined ID,\n```\n\nIf we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked\nas UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.\n\nIn a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb (\"media: uvcvideo: Require\nentities to have a non-zero unique ID\"), we ignored all the invalid units,\nthis broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky\nthis time.\n\nThis also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due\nto a chain of entities referring to themselves.

We handle this with the cifs_sg_set_buf() helper\nthat converts vmalloc'd memory to their corresponding pages.\n\nHowever, when we allocate our aead_request buffer (@creq in\nsmb2ops.c::crypt_message()), we do so with kvzalloc(), which possibly\nputs aead_request-\u003e__ctx in vmalloc area.\n\nAEAD algorithm then uses -\u003e__ctx for its private/internal data and\noperations, and uses sg_set_buf() for such data on a few places.\n\nThis works fine as long as @creq falls into kmalloc zone (small\nrequests) or vmalloc'd memory is still within linear range.\n\nTasks' stacks are vmalloc'd by default (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), so too\nmany tasks will increment the base stacks' addresses to a point where\nvirt_addr_valid(buf) will fail (BUG() in sg_set_buf()) when that\nhappens.\n\nIn practice: too many parallel reads and writes on an encrypted mount\nwill trigger this bug.\n\nTo fix this, always alloc @creq with kmalloc() instead.\nAlso drop the @sensitive_size variable/arguments since\nkfree_sensitive() doesn't need it.\n\nBacktrace:\n\n[  945.272081] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  945.272774] kernel BUG at include/linux/scatterlist.h:209!\n[  945.273520] Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC NOPTI\n[  945.274412] CPU: 7 UID: 0 PID: 56 Comm: kworker/u33:0 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.15.0-lku-11779-g8e9d6efccdd7-dirty #1 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n[  945.275736] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.3-2-gc13ff2cd-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[  945.276877] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-cifs-2)\n[  945.277457] RIP: 0010:crypto_gcm_init_common+0x1f9/0x220\n[  945.278018] Code: b0 00 00 00 48 83 c4 08 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e 41 5f c3 cc cc cc cc 48 c7 c0 00 00 00 80 48 2b 05 5c 58 e5 00 e9 58 ff ff ff \u003c0f\u003e 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 0f 0b 48 c7 04 24 01 00 00 00 48 8b\n[  945.279992] RSP: 0018:ffffc90000a27360 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[  945.280578] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffc90001d85060 RCX: 0000000000000030\n[  945.281376] RDX: 0000000000080000 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffffc90081d85070\n[  945.282145] RBP: ffffc90001d85010 R08: ffffc90001d85000 R09: 0000000000000000\n[  945.282898] R10: ffffc90001d85090 R11: 0000000000001000 R12: ffffc90001d85070\n[  945.283656] R13: ffff888113522948 R14: ffffc90001d85060 R15: ffffc90001d85010\n[  945.284407] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8882e66cf000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  945.285262] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  945.285884] CR2: 00007fa7ffdd31f4 CR3: 000000010540d000 CR4: 0000000000350ef0\n[  945.286683] Call Trace:\n[  945.286952]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  945.287184]  ? crypt_message+0x33f/0xad0 [cifs]\n[  945.287719]  crypto_gcm_encrypt+0x36/0xe0\n[  945.288152]  crypt_message+0x54a/0xad0 [cifs]\n[  945.288724]  smb3_init_transform_rq+0x277/0x300 [cifs]\n[  945.289300]  smb_send_rqst+0xa3/0x160 [cifs]\n[  945.289944]  cifs_call_async+0x178/0x340 [cifs]\n[  945.290514]  ? __pfx_smb2_writev_callback+0x10/0x10 [cifs]\n[  945.291177]  smb2_async_writev+0x3e3/0x670 [cifs]\n[  945.291759]  ? find_held_lock+0x32/0x90\n[  945.292212]  ? netfs_advance_write+0xf2/0x310\n[  945.292723]  netfs_advance_write+0xf2/0x310\n[  945.293210]  netfs_write_folio+0x346/0xcc0\n[  945.293689]  ? __pfx__raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x10/0x10\n[  945.294250]  netfs_writepages+0x117/0x460\n[  945.294724]  do_writepages+0xbe/0x170\n[  945.295152]  ? find_held_lock+0x32/0x90\n[  945.295600]  ? kvm_sched_clock_read+0x11/0x20\n[  945.296103]  __writeback_single_inode+0x56/0x4b0\n[  945.296643]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x229/0x550\n[  945.297140]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x4c/0xe0\n[  945.297642]  wb_writeback+0x2f1/0x3f0\n[  945.298069]  wb_workfn+0x300/0x490\n[  945.298472]  process_one_work+0x1fe/0x590\n[  945.298949]  worker_thread+0x1ce/0x3c0\n[  945.299397]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n[  945.299900]  kthr\n---truncated---(CVE-2025-40052)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk\n\nDirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically updating the dirty bit\nin the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging-\nstructure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In\nanother word, if the iommu page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking\ndoesn't work.\n\nThe Intel VT-d specification, Section 3.10 \"Snoop Behavior\" states:\n\n\"Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically update A/EA/D bits\n in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-\n recoverable fault.\"\n\nTo prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page\ntracking when it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as\nsupported only when both ecap_slads and ecap_smpwc are supported.(CVE-2025-40058)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/rxe: Fix race in do_task() when draining\n\nWhen do_task() exhausts its iteration budget (!ret), it sets the state\nto TASK_STATE_IDLE to reschedule, without a secondary check on the\ncurrent task-\u003estate. This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended.(CVE-2025-40061)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv4: start using dst_dev_rcu()\n\nChange icmpv4_xrlim_allow(), ip_defrag() to prevent possible UAF.\n\nChange ipmr_prepare_xmit(), ipmr_queue_fwd_xmit(), ip_mr_output(),\nipv4_neigh_lookup() to use lockdep enabled dst_dev_rcu().(CVE-2025-40074)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp_metrics: use dst_dev_net_rcu()\n\nReplace three dst_dev() with a lockdep enabled helper.(CVE-2025-40075)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nixgbevf: fix mailbox API compatibility by negotiating supported features\n\nThere was backward compatibility in the terms of mailbox API. Various\ndrivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio\ncould easily negotiate mailbox API.\n\nThis convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.\nCommit 0062e7cc955e (\"ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code\") added support\nfor IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the\nrest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of\nsupport was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such\ncode paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was\nintroduced along with introduction of the feature itself.\n\nCommit 339f28964147 (\"ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication\nbetween PF and VF\") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it\nintroduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API\nversion for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version\ndefined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,\nas the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe\ndriver as it causes crashes.\n\nThe issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit\nd0725312adf5 (\"ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5\").\nAs a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API\nto version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.\n\nTo fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported\nfeatures. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec\nand ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.\n\nNew mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API\nrevision, as API version of OOT PF \u0026 VF drivers is already increased to\n1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.\n\nFeatures negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new\nfeatures when needed in the future.(CVE-2025-40104)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix invalid quirk input mapping\n\nWhen an invalid value is passed via quirk option, currently\nbytcr_rt5640 driver just ignores and leaves as is, which may lead to\nunepxected results like OOB access.\n\nThis patch adds the sanity check and corrects the input mapping to the\ncertain default value if an invalid value is passed.(CVE-2025-40121)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: use RCU in ip6_xmit()\n\nUse RCU in ip6_xmit() in order to use dst_dev_rcu() to prevent\npossible UAF.(CVE-2025-40135)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in in smc_clc_prfx_set().\n\nsmc_clc_prfx_set() is called during connect() and not under RCU\nnor RTNL.\n\nUsing sk_dst_get(sk)-\u003edev could trigger UAF.\n\nLet's use __sk_dst_get() and dev_dst_rcu() under rcu_read_lock()\nafter kernel_getsockname().\n\nNote that the returned value of smc_clc_prfx_set() is not used\nin the caller.\n\nWhile at it, we change the 1st arg of smc_clc_prfx_set[46]_rcu()\nnot to touch dst there.(CVE-2025-40139)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in get_netdev_for_sock().\n\nget_netdev_for_sock() is called during setsockopt(),\nso not under RCU.\n\nUsing sk_dst_get(sk)-\u003edev could trigger UAF.\n\nLet's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu().\n\nNote that the only -\u003endo_sk_get_lower_dev() user is\nbond_sk_get_lower_dev(), which uses RCU.(CVE-2025-40149)\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: debugfs: Fix legacy mode page table dump logic\n\nIn legacy mode, SSPTPTR is ignored if TT is not 00b or 01b.

In the current\nimplementation, the block_device structure is set after the function\nreturns to the caller.\n\nHere, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer\nhead as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the\ncaller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it\nwas reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call\ntouch_buffer() here in the first place.\n\nSo this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.",

This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus\nmake an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not\nexpect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the\nclass eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThe referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC\ncase by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to\nbe incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.\nThe following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:\n\n    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr\n    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole\n\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n\nSince backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale\nclass pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes\na different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch\nensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when\nthe child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of\nqdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or\nqdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing\nthe following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note\nthat this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This\nis not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the\nclassful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.",

However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/",

There are a couple of\nproblems with the above scheme.\n\nThe first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled while the device is running:\n\n # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0\n # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off\n # ip link del dev bond1\n\nWhen the device is put administratively down the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the\nmemory will be leaked [1].\n\nAnother problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically\ndelete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not\nadding it when the device was put administratively up since during that\ntime the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or\nbug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount\nimbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:\n\n$ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0\n$ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off\n$ ifconfig bond0 up\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on\n$ ifconfig bond0 down\n$ ip link del vlan0\n\nRoot cause is as below:\nstep1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team.\nregister_vlan_dev\n    vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1\nstep2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev\nstep3: change filter from 0 to 1\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_filter_push_vids\n        ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0\nstep4: real_dev down\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0\n        vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0\nstep5: delete vlan0\nunregister_vlan_dev\n    BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null\n\nFix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was\nautomatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it\nshould be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the\n\"rx-vlan-filter\" feature.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880068e3100 (size 256):\n  comm \"ip\", pid 384, jiffies 4296130254\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 20 30 0d 80 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  . 0.............\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace (crc 81ce31fa):\n    __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2b5/0x340\n    vlan_vid_add+0x434/0x940\n    vlan_device_event.cold+0x75/0xa8\n    notifier_call_chain+0xca/0x150\n    __dev_notify_flags+0xe3/0x250\n    rtnl_configure_link+0x193/0x260\n    rtnl_newlink_create+0x383/0x8e0\n    __rtnl_newlink+0x22c/0xa40\n    rtnl_newlink+0x627/0xb00\n    rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x6fb/0xb70\n    netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x350\n    netlink_unicast+0x426/0x710\n    netlink_sendmsg+0x75a/0xc20\n    __sock_sendmsg+0xc1/0x150\n    ____sys_sendmsg+0x5aa/0x7b0\n    ___sys_sendmsg+0xfc/0x180\n\n[2]\nkernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.c:99!\nOops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 382 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.16.0-rc3 #61 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),\nBIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:unregister_vlan_dev (net/8021q/vlan.c:99 (discriminator 1))\nRSP: 0018:ffff88810badf310 EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88810da84000 RCX: ffffffffb47ceb9a\nRDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: ffff88810e8b43c8\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: fffffbfff6cefe80\nR10: ffffffffb677f407 R11: ffff88810badf3c0 R12: ffff88810e8b4000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffff88810642a5c0 R15: 000000000000017e\nFS:  00007f1ff68c20c0(0000) GS:ffff888163a24000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f1ff5dad240 CR3: 0000000107e56000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\n---truncated---",

However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.\n\nAs a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,\ntested on v6.15.

The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2\u003e\u00261 \u003e/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",

A kernel\nbuffer is allocated to hold `insn-\u003en` samples (each of which is an\n`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn-\u003en` samples are\ncopied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The\nproblem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return\ndata to userspace fill in the whole `insn-\u003en` samples, so that there is\nan information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at\nthe time of writing.\n\nOne culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for\n`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have\na specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`\nhandler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if\n`insn-\u003en` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn-\u003en - 1` samples copied\nto userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.\n\nAnother culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the \"vm80xx\" driver.  It\nnever returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.\n\nFix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure\nthat uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before\nhandling each instruction.\n\nThanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.

The value 0x00 is\nreserved for undefined ID,\n```\n\nIf we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked\nas UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.\n\nIn a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb (\"media: uvcvideo: Require\nentities to have a non-zero unique ID\"), we ignored all the invalid units,\nthis broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky\nthis time.\n\nThis also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due\nto a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, an\nOutput Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. But\nwhen looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity is\nfound instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.\n\nIn another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source ID\nwas 0.

This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended.",

Various\ndrivers from various OSes supporting 10G adapters from Intel portfolio\ncould easily negotiate mailbox API.\n\nThis convention has been broken since introducing API 1.4.\nCommit 0062e7cc955e (\"ixgbevf: add VF IPsec offload code\") added support\nfor IPSec which is specific only for the kernel ixgbe driver. None of the\nrest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of\nsupport was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such\ncode paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was\nintroduced along with introduction of the feature itself.\n\nCommit 339f28964147 (\"ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication\nbetween PF and VF\") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it\nintroduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API\nversion for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version\ndefined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,\nas the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe\ndriver as it causes crashes.\n\nThe issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit\nd0725312adf5 (\"ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5\").\nAs a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API\nto version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.\n\nTo fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported\nfeatures. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec\nand ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.\n\nNew mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API\nrevision, as API version of OOT PF \u0026 VF drivers is already increased to\n1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.\n\nFeatures negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new\nfeatures when needed in the future.",
