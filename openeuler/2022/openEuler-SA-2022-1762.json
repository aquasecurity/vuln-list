It provide a complete set of widgets,and suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA flaw was found in gdk-pixbuf in versions before 2.42.0. An integer wraparound leading to an out of bounds write can occur when a crafted GIF image is loaded. An attacker may cause applications to crash or could potentially execute code on the victim system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-20240)\n\nGNOME gdk-pixbuf (aka GdkPixbuf) before 2.42.2 allows a denial of service (infinite loop) in lzw.c in the function write_indexes. if c-\u003eself_code equals 10, self-\u003ecode_table[10].extends will assign the value 11 to c. The next execution in the loop will assign self-\u003ecode_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value of 10. This will make the loop run infinitely. This bug can, for example, be triggered by calling this function with a GIF image with LZW compression that is crafted in a special way.(CVE-2020-29385)",
