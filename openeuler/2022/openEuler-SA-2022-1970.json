A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a web application firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted resource may bypass pattern matching techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia level of 3 or higher.(CVE-2022-39958)\n\nThe OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an optional \"charset\" parameter in order to receive the response in an encoded form. Depending on the \"charset\", this response can not be decoded by the web application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection.
