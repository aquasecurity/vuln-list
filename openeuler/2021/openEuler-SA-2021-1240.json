      "Text": "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server. It handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process and keeps meta data and implements negative caching of failed requests.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nSquid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (affecting availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent by the server.(CVE-2021-33620)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a memory-management bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack (against all clients using the proxy) via HTTP Range request processing.(CVE-2021-31806)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to an input-validation bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack (against all clients using the proxy). A client sends an HTTP Range request to trigger this.(CVE-2021-31808)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Squid 4.x before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. If a remote server sends a certain response header over HTTP or HTTPS, there is a denial of service. This header can plausibly occur in benign network traffic.(CVE-2021-28662)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service. When resolving a request with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a small amount of memory. However, there is an unspecified attack methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory consumption.(CVE-2021-28651)\n\nAn issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service attack against the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.(CVE-2021-28652)",
