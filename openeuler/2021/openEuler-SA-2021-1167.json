A crafted input file that is processed by OpenEXR could cause a shift overflow in the FastHufDecoder, potentially leading to problems with application availability.(CVE-2021-3474)\n\nThere's a flaw in OpenEXR's deep tile sample size calculations in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could trigger an integer overflow, subsequently leading to an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk of this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2021-3477)\n\nThere is a flaw in OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker who can submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could cause an integer overflow, potentially leading to problems with application availability.(CVE-2021-3475)\n\nA flaw was found in OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.0-beta.
