      "Text": "Infinispan is an extremely scalable, highly available data grid platform - 100% open source, and written in Java. The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a Cache interface which extends java.util.Map. It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nIt was found that the Hotrod client in Infinispan before 9.2.0.CR1 would unsafely read deserialized data on information from the cache. An authenticated attacker could inject a malicious object into the data cache and attain deserialization on the client, and possibly conduct further attacks.(CVE-2017-15089)\n\nThe hotrod java client in infinispan before 9.1.0.Final automatically deserializes bytearray message contents in certain events. A malicious user could exploit this flaw by injecting a specially-crafted serialized object to attain remote code execution or conduct other attacks.(CVE-2016-0750)",
