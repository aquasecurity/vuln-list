  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62595",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/koa",
  "Title": "Koa Vulnerable to Open Redirect via Trailing Double-Slash (//) in back Redirect Logic",
  "Description": "A bypass was discovered in the `Koa.js` framework affecting its back redirect functionality. In certain circumstances, an attacker can manipulate the Referer header to force a user’s browser to navigate to an external, potentially malicious website. This occurs because the implementation incorrectly treats some specially crafted URLs as safe relative paths. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow attackers to perform phishing, social engineering, or other redirect-based attacks on users of affected applications.\n\nThis vulnerability affects the code referenced in GitHub Advisory GHSA-jgmv-j7ww-jx2x (which is tracked as CVE‑2025‑54420).",
