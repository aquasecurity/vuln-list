  "Title": "Global node_modules Binary Overwrite in bin-links",
  "Description": "Versions of `bin-links` are vulnerable to a Global node_modules Binary Overwrite. It fails to prevent globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installs. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite the first binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations.",
