  "Title": "Directus has a DOM-Based cross-site scripting (XSS) via layout_options",
  "Description": "Directus allows an authenticated attacker to save cross site scripting code to the database. This is possible because the application injects an attacker-controlled parameter that will be stored in the server and used by the client into an unsanitized DOM element. When chained with [CVE-2024-6534](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-3fff-gqw3-vj86), it could result in account takeover.",
