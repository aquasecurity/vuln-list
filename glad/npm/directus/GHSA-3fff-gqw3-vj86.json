  "Title": "Directus has an insecure object reference via PATH presets",
  "Description": "Directus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated external attacker to modify presets created by the same user to assign them to another user. This is possible because the application only validates the user parameter in the `POST /presets` request but not in the PATCH request. When chained with [CVE-2024-6533](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-9qrm-48qf-r2rw), it could result in account takeover.\n\nThis vulnerability occurs because the application only validates the user parameter in the `POST /presets` request but not in the PATCH request.",
