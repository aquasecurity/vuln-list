  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6534",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/directus",
  "Title": "Directus has an insecure object reference via PATH presets",

When chained with [CVE-2024-6533](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-9qrm-48qf-r2rw), it could result in account takeover.\n\nThis vulnerability occurs because the application only validates the user parameter in the `POST /presets` request but not in the PATCH request.",
