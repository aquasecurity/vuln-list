  "PackageSlug": "npm/directus",
  "Title": "Directus Vulnerable to Information Leakage in Existing Collections",
  "Description": "An observable difference in error messaging was found in the Directus REST API. The `/items/{collection}` API returns different error messages for these two cases:\n1. A user tries to access an existing collection which they are not authorized to access.\n2. A user tries to access a non-existing collection.\n\nThe two differing error messages leak the existence of collections to users which are not authorized to access these collections.",
