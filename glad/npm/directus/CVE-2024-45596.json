  "Title": "Session is cached for OpenID and OAuth2 if `redirect` is not used",
  "Description": "Unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include `redirect` query string.\n\nFor example:\n- Project is configured with OpenID or OAuth2\n- Project is configured with cache enabled\n- User tries to login via SSO link, but without `redirect` query string\n- After successful login, credentials are cached\n- If an unauthenticated user tries to login via SSO link, it will return the credentials of the other last user\n\nThe SSO link is something like `https://directus.example.com/auth/login/openid/callback`, where `openid` is the name of the OpenID provider configured in Directus",
