  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28239",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/directus",
  "Title": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site in OAuth2/OpenID in directus",
  "Description": "### Summary\nThe authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL https://docs.directus.io/reference/authentication.html#login-using-sso-providers /auth/login/google?redirect for example.\n\n### Details\nThere's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`, which I think is here: https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/auth/drivers/oauth2.ts#L394. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password.\n\n### PoC\nTurn on any auth provider in Directus instance. Form a link to `directus-instance/auth/login/:provider_id?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`, login and get taken to malicious-site. Tested on the `ory` OAuth2 integration.\n\n### Impact\nUsers who login via OAuth2 into Directus.",
