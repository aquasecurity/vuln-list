  "PackageSlug": "npm/@digitalbazaar/zcap",
  "Title": "zcap has incomplete expiration checks in capability chains.",
  "Description": "When invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material.",
