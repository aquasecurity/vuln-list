  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21413",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/isolated-vm",
  "Title": "Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources",
  "Description": "isolated-vm has API pitfalls which may make it easy for implementers to expose supposed secure isolates to the permissions of the main nodejs isolate. Reference objects allow access to the underlying reference's full prototype chain. In an environment where the implementer has exposed a Reference instance to an attacker they would be able to use it to acquire a Reference to the nodejs context's Function object. Similar application-specific attacks could be possible by modifying the local prototype of other API objects. Access to NativeModule objects could allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on the filesystem.",
