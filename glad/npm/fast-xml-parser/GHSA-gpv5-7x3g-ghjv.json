  "Title": "fast-xml-parser regex vulnerability patch could be improved from a safety perspective",
  "Description": "### Summary\nThis is a comment on https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-6w63-h3fj-q4vw and the patches fixing it.\n\n### Details\nThe code which validates a name calls the validator:\n https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/blob/ecf6016f9b48aec1a921e673158be0773d07283e/src/xmlparser/DocTypeReader.js#L145-L153\nThis checks for the presence of an invalid character. Such an approach is always risky, as it is so easy to forget to include an invalid character in the list. A safer approach is to validate entity names against the XML specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec-common-syn - an ENTITY name is a Name:\n\n```\n[4]  NameStartChar ::= \":\" | [A-Z] | \"_\" | [a-z] | [#xC0-#xD6] | [#xD8-#xF6] | [#xF8-#x2FF] | [#x370-#x37D] |\n [#x37F-#x1FFF] | [#x200C-#x200D] | [#x2070-#x218F] | [#x2C00-#x2FEF] | [#x3001-#xD7FF] |\n [#xF900-#xFDCF] | [#xFDF0-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#xEFFFF]\n[4a] NameChar ::= NameStartChar | \"-\" | \".\" | [0-9] | #xB7 | [#x0300-#x036F] | [#x203F-#x2040]\n[5]  Name ::= NameStartChar (NameChar)*\n```\n\nso the safest way to validate an entity name is to build a regex to represent this expression and check whether the name given matches the regex. (Something along the lines of `/^[name start char class][name char class]*$/`.) There's probably a nice way to simplify the explicit list rather than typing it out verbatim using Unicode character properties, but I don't know enough to do so.",
