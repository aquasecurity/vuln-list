  "Title": "Flowise doesn't Prevent Bypass of Password Confirmation through Unverified Email Change (credentials)",
  "Description": "Unverified Email Change - Email as part of Credential / Unverified Account Recovery Channel Change\n\nThe application allows changing the account email address (used as a login identifier and/or password recovery address) without verifying the requester’s authority to make that change (no confirmation to the old email, no authentication step). Because email often functions as a credential or recovery channel, unverified email changes enable attackers to take over accounts by switching the account’s recovery/login address.",
