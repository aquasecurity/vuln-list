  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-55294",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/screenshot-desktop",
  "Title": "screenshot-desktop vulnerable to command Injection via `format` option",
  "Description": "This vulnerability is a **command injection** issue.\nWhen user-controlled input is passed into the `format` option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization.\nAn attacker can craft malicious input such as:\n\n{ format: \"; echo vulnerable \u003e /tmp/hello;\" }\n\nThis results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\nAny application that accepts untrusted input and forwards it directly (or indirectly) into the `format` option is affected. If the library is used in a server-side context (e.g., API endpoints, web services), attackers may be able to exploit this **remotely and without authentication**, leading to full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical)\n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`",
