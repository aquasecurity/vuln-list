  "PackageSlug": "npm/@opennextjs/cloudflare",
  "Title": "OpenNext for Cloudflare (opennextjs-cloudflare) has a SSRF vulnerability via /_next/image endpoint",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in the @opennextjs/cloudflare package.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an unimplemented feature in the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next, which allowed unauthenticated users to proxy arbitrary remote content via the `/_next/image` endpoint.\n\nThis issue allowed attackers to load remote resources from arbitrary hosts under the victim site’s domain for any site deployed using the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next.  For example: `https://victim-site.com/_next/image?url=https://attacker.com`. In this example, attacker-controlled content from attacker.com is served through the victim site’s domain (`victim-site.com`), violating the same-origin policy and potentially misleading users or other services.",
