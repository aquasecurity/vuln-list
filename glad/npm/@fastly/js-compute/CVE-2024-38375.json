  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-38375",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@fastly/js-compute",
  "Title": "@fastly/js-compute has a use-after-free in some host call implementations",
  "Description": "The implementation of the following functions were determined to include a use-after-free bug:\n\n* `FetchEvent.client.tlsCipherOpensslName`\n* `FetchEvent.client.tlsProtocol`\n* `FetchEvent.client.tlsClientCertificate`\n* `FetchEvent.client.tlsJA3MD5`\n* `FetchEvent.client.tlsClientHello`\n* `CacheEntry.prototype.userMetadata` of the `fastly:cache` subsystem\n* `Device.lookup` of the `fastly:device` subsystem\n\nThis bug could allow for an unintended data leak if the result of the preceding functions were sent anywhere else, and often results in a Compute service crash causing an HTTP 500 error to be returned. As all requests to Compute are isolated from one another, the only data at risk is data present for a single request.",
