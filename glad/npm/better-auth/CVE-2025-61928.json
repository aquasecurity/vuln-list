  "PackageSlug": "npm/better-auth",
  "Title": "Better Auth: Unauthenticated API key creation through api-key plugin",
  "Description": "A critical authentication bypass was identified in the API key creation and update endpoints. An attacker could create or modify API keys for arbitrary users by supplying a victim’s user ID in the request body. Due to a flaw in how the authenticated user was derived, the endpoints could treat attacker-controlled input as an authenticated user object under certain conditions.",
