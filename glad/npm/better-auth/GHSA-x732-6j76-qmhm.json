  "Title": "Better Auth's rou3 Dependency has Double-Slash Path Normalization which can Bypass disabledPaths Config and Rate Limits",
  "Description": "An issue in the underlying router library **rou3** can cause `/path` and `//path` to be treated as identical routes. If your environment does **not** normalize incoming URLs (e.g., by collapsing multiple slashes), this can allow bypasses of `disabledPaths` and path-based rate limits.",
