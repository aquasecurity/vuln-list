  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62378",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/commandkit",
  "Title": "CommandKit has incorrect command name exposure in context object for message command aliases",
  "Description": "A logic flaw exists in the message command handler of CommandKit that affects how the `commandName` property is exposed to both middleware functions and command execution contexts when handling command aliases. When a message command is invoked using an alias, the `ctx.commandName` value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This occurs in both middleware functions and within the command’s own run function.\n\nAlthough not explicitly documented, CommandKit’s examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly convey that `ctx.commandName` represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples in the documentation consistently use `ctx.commandName` to reference the command being executed, and the documentation describes middleware as suitable for “logging, authentication, permission checks, or any other cross-cutting concerns.” As a result, developers reasonably expect `ctx.commandName` to return the canonical command name and may rely on it for security-sensitive logic.\n\nDevelopers who assume `ctx.commandName` is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands and context menu commands are not affected.",
