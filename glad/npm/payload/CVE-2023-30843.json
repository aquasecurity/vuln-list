  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-30843",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/payload",
  "Title": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
  "Description": "Payload is a free and open source headless content management system. In versions prior to 1.7.0, if a user has access to documents that contain hidden fields or fields they do not have access to, the user could reverse-engineer those values via brute force. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, write a `beforeOperation` hook to remove `where` queries that attempt to access hidden field data.",
