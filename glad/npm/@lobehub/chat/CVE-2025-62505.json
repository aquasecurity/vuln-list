  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62505",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@lobehub/chat",
  "Title": "Lobe Chat vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery with native web fetch module",
  "Description": "---\n\n- Since the server performs outbound requests to internal networks, localhost, and metadata endpoints, an attacker can abuse the server’s network position to access internal resources (internal APIs, management ports, cloud metadata, etc.).\n\n- As a result, this can lead to exposure of internal system information, leakage of authentication tokens/secret keys (e.g., IMDSv1/v2), misuse of internal admin interfaces, and provide a foothold for further lateral movement.\n\n- By leveraging user-supplied impls to force the unfiltered naive implementation, SSRF defenses—such as blocking private/metadata IPs, DNS re-validation/re-resolution, and redirect restrictions—can be bypassed.",
