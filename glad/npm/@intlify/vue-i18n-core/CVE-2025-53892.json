  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-53892",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@intlify/vue-i18n-core",
  "Title": "vue-i18n's escapeParameterHtml does not prevent DOM-based XSS through its tag attributes",
  "Description": "The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, this setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as `\u003cimg src=x onerror=...\u003e`, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using v-html.\n\nThis may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using escapeParameterHtml: true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html.",
