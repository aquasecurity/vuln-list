  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-26073",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/atlassian-connect-express",
  "Title": "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Express",
  "Description": "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Express (ACE) from version 3.0.2 before version 6.6.0: Atlassian Connect Express is a Node.js package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Express app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Express versions between 3.0.2 - 6.5.0 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.",
