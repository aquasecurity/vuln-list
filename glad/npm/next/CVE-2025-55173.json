  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-55173",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/next",
  "Title": "Next.js Content Injection Vulnerability for Image Optimization",
  "Description": "A vulnerability in **Next.js Image Optimization** has been fixed in **v15.4.5** and **v14.2.31**. The issue allowed attacker-controlled external image sources to trigger file downloads with arbitrary content and filenames under specific configurations. This behavior could be abused for phishing or malicious file delivery.\n\nAll users relying on `images.domains` or `images.remotePatterns` are encouraged to upgrade and verify that external image sources are strictly validated.\n\nMore details at [Vercel Changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-55173)",
