  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-21721",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/next",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Next. one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.",
