  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-34350",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/next",
  "Title": "Next.js Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling",
  "Description": "Inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions.\n\nFor a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js.",
