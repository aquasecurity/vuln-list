  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-46982",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/next",
  "Title": "Next.js Cache Poisoning",
  "Description": "By sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route in the pages router (this does not affect the app router). When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well.\n\nTo be potentially affected all of the following must apply:\n\n- Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9\n- Using pages router\n- Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`\n\nThe below configurations are unaffected:\n\n- Deployments using only app router\n- Deployments on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are not affected",
