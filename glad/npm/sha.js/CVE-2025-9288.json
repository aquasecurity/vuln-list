  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-9288",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/sha.js",
  "Title": "sha.js is missing type checks leading to hash rewind and passing on crafted data",
  "Description": "This is the same as [GHSA-cpq7-6gpm-g9rc](https://github.com/browserify/cipher-base/security/advisories/GHSA-cpq7-6gpm-g9rc) but just for `sha.js`, as it has its own implementation.\n\nMissing input type checks can allow types other than a well-formed `Buffer` or `string`, resulting in invalid values, hanging and rewinding the hash state (including turning a tagged hash into an untagged hash), or other generally undefined behaviour.",
