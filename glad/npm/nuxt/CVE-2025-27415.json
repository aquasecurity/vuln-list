  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27415",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/nuxt",
  "Title": "Nuxt allows DOS via cache poisoning with payload rendering response",
  "Description": "By sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site.\n\nIt is possible to craft a request, such as `https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json` which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site.",
