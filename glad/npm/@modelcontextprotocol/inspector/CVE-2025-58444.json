  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-58444",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector",
  "Title": "MCP Inspector is Vulnerable to Potential Command Execution via XSS When Connecting to an Untrusted MCP Server",
  "Description": "An XSS flaw exists in the MCP Inspector local development tool when it renders a redirect URL returned by a remote MCP server. If the Inspector connects to an untrusted server, a crafted redirect can inject script into the Inspector context and, via the built-in proxy, be leveraged to trigger arbitrary command execution on the developer machine. Version 0.16.6 hardens URL handling/validation and prevents script execution.\n\n\u003e Thank you to the following researchers for their reports and contributions:\n\u003e * Raymond (Veria Labs)\n\u003e * Gavin Zhong, \u003csuperboyzjc@gmail.com\u003e \u0026 Shuyang Wang, \u003cswang@obsidiansecurity.com\u003e.",
