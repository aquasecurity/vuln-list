  "Description": "Versions of `quill` prior to 1.3.7 are vulnerable to [Reverse Tabnabbing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Reverse_Tabnabbing). The package uses `target='_blank'` in anchor tags, allowing attackers to access `window.opener` for the original page when opening links. This is commonly used for phishing attacks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
