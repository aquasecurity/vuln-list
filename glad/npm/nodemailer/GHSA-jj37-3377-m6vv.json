  "Title": "Duplicate Advisory: Nodemailer: Email to an unintended domain can occur due to Interpretation Conflict",
  "Description": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-mm7p-fcc7-pg87. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA vulnerability was identified in the email parsing library due to improper handling of specially formatted recipient email addresses. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a recipient address that embeds an external address within quotes. This causes the application to misdirect the email to the attacker's external address instead of the intended internal recipient. This could lead to a significant data leak of sensitive information and allow an attacker to bypass security filters and access controls.",
