  "PackageSlug": "npm/glossarizer",
  "Title": "Glossarizer Cross-site Scripting vulnerability",
  "Description": "Glossarizer through 1.5.2 improperly tries to convert text into HTML. Even though the application itself escapes special characters (e.g., \u003c\u003e), the underlying library converts these encoded characters into legitimate HTML, thereby possibly causing stored XSS. Attackers can append a XSS payload to a word that has a corresponding glossary entry.",
