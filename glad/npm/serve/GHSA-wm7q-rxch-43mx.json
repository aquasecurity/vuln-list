  "Title": "Byass due to validation before canonicalization in serve",
  "Description": "Versions of `serve` before 6.5.2 are vulnerable to the bypass of the ignore functionality. The bypass is possible because validation happens before canonicalization of paths and filenames.\n\n\n\nExample:\nHere we have a server that ignores the file test.txt.\n```\nconst serve = require('serve')\nconst server = serve(__dirname, {\n      port: 1337,\n      ignore: ['test.txt']\n})\n```\n\nUsing the URL encoded form of a letter (%65 instead of e) attacker can bypass the ignore control accessing the file. \n\n`curl http://localhost:1337/t%65st.txt`\n\nAdditionally this technique can be used to get directory listings of ignored directories.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 6.5.2 or later.",
