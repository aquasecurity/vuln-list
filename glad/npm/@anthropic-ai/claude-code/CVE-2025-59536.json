  "PackageSlug": "npm/@anthropic-ai/claude-code",
  "Title": "Claude Code can execute commands prior to the startup trust dialog ",
  "Description": "Due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation, Claude Code could be tricked to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/avivdon for reporting this issue!",
