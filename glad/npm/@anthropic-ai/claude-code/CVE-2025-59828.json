  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59828",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@anthropic-ai/claude-code",
  "Title": "Claude Code Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Autoloading with Specific Yarn Versions",
  "Description": "In Claude Code versions prior to **1.0.39**, when the tool is used with **Yarn 2.x or newer (Berry)**, Yarn plugins are automatically loaded and executed when running `yarn --version`. In Claude Code this sequence could execute plugin code before the user accepts the directory trust prompt for an untrusted workspace, resulting in a potential arbitrary code execution path. **Yarn Classic (v1)** is not affected. The issue is fixed in **1.0.39**.",
