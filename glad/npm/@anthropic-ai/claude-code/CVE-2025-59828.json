  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59828",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@anthropic-ai/claude-code",
  "Title": "Claude Code Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via Plugin Autoloading with Specific Yarn Versions",
  "Description": "When using Claude Code with Yarn installed, Yarn config files can trigger code execution when running `yarn --version`. This could lead to a bypass of the directory trust dialog in Claude Code, as plugins and `yarnPath` could be executed prior to the user accepting the risks of working in an untrusted directory. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to [https://hackerone.com/michel_](https://hackerone.com/michel_) for reporting this issue!",
