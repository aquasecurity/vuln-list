  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-25164",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/tinacms",
  "Title": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
  "Description": "Tinacms is a Git-backed headless content management system with support for visual editing. Sites being built with @tinacms/cli \u003e= 1.0.0 \u0026\u0026 \u003c 1.0.9 which store sensitive values in the process.env variable are impacted. These values will be added in plaintext to the index.js file. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0 this vulnerability does not affect you. If you are affected and your Tina-enabled website has sensitive credentials stored as environment variables (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
