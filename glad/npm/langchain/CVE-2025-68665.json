  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68665",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/langchain",
  "Title": "LangChain serialization injection vulnerability enables secret extraction",
  "Description": "Attackers who control serialized data can extract environment variable secrets by injecting `{\"lc\": 1, \"type\": \"secret\", \"id\": [\"ENV_VAR\"]}` to load environment variables during deserialization (when `secretsFromEnv: true`). They can also instantiate classes with controlled parameters by injecting constructor structures to instantiate any class within the provided import maps with attacker-controlled parameters, potentially triggering side effects such as network calls or file operations.\n\nKey severity factors:\n\n- Affects the serialization path—applications trusting their own serialization output are vulnerable\n- Enables secret extraction when combined with `secretsFromEnv: true`\n- LLM responses in `additional_kwargs` can be controlled via prompt injection",
