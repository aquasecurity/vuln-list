  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-22143",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/convict",
  "Title": "Duplicate of ./npm/convict/CVE-2022-22143.yml",
  "Description": "An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components and override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.\n\nThe main use case of Convict is for handling server-side configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\nThe problem is patched in `convict@6.2.2`. Users should upgrade to `convict@6.2.2`. There is no way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading.",
