  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-57075",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/eazy-logger",
  "Title": "eazy-logger prototype pollution",
  "Description": "A prototype pollution in the lib.Logger function of eazy-logger v4.0.1 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.\n\nAn attacker can supply a payload with `Object.prototype` setter to introduce or modify properties within the global prototype chain, causing denial of service (DoS) a the minimum consequence.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of this vulnerability can escalate to other injection-based attacks, depending on how the library integrates within the application. For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., `child_process.exec`, `eval`), it could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context.",
