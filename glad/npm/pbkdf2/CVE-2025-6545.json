  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-6545",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/pbkdf2",
  "Title": "pbkdf2 returns predictable uninitialized/zero-filled memory for non-normalized or unimplemented algos",
  "Description": "This affects both:\n1. Unsupported algos (e.g. `sha3-256` / `sha3-512` / `sha512-256`)\n2. Supported but non-normalized algos (e.g. `Sha256` / `Sha512` / `SHA1` / `sha-1` / `sha-256` / `sha-512`)\n\nAll of those work correctly in Node.js, but this polyfill silently returns highly predictable ouput\n\nUnder Node.js (only with `pbkdf2/browser` import, unlikely) / Bun (`pbkdf2` top-level import is affected), the memory is not zero-filled but is uninitialized, as `Buffer.allocUnsafe` is used\n\nUnder browsers, it just returns zero-filled buffers\n(Which is also critical, those are completely unacceptable as kdf output and ruin security)",
