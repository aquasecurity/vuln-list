  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45812",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/vite",
  "Title": "Vite DOM Clobbering gadget found in vite bundled scripts that leads to XSS",
  "Description": "We discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite when building scripts to `cjs`/`iife`/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present.\n\nNote that, we have identified similar security issues in Webpack: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986",
