  "Description": "The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. Customers use it to create their own applications which are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates during deployment to a customerâ€™s AWS account. CDK contains pre-built components called \"[constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html)\" that are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation templates.",
