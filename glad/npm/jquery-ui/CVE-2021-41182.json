  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41182",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/jquery-ui",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
  "Description": "jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting the value of the `altField` option of the Datepicker widget from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `altField` option is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `altField` option from untrusted sources.",
