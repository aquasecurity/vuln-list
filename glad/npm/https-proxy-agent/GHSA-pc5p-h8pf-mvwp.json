The package fails to enforce TLS on the socket if the proxy server responds the to the request with a HTTP status different than 200. This allows an attacker with access to the proxy server to intercept unencrypted communications, which may include sensitive information such as credentials.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.0.0 or 2.2.3.",
