  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59037",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@duckdb/node-bindings",
  "Title": "DuckDB NPM packages 1.3.3 and 1.29.2 briefly compromised with malware",
  "Description": "The DuckDB distribution for [Node.js](http://node.js/) on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) was compromised with malware (along with [several other packages](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised)). An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included **malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions**. The following packages and versions are affected:\n\n- `@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3`\n- `@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3`\n- `duckdb@1.3.3`\n- `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2`\n\n\u003e Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2, with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they are not accidentally updating to those affected versions.\n\n\nWe have ourselves noticed this *within four hours* of it happening. Here’s our response:\n\n- As an immediate response, we have **deprecated** the specific versions.\n- We have reached out to npm support to **delete the affected versions**. They were so kind to do so.\n- We have also **re-released** the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the latest version of the package points to a safe version\n\nWe apologize for this issue. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.",
