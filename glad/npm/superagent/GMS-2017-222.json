  "PackageSlug": "npm/superagent",
  "Title": "Large gzip Denial of Service",
  "Description": "In a ZIP Bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes a request to.",
