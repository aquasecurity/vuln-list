  "Identifier": "GMS-2016-22",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/console-io",
  "Title": "Authentication Bypass",
  "Description": "A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response.",
