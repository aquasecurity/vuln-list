  "Identifier": "CVE-2014-4671A",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/hapi",
  "Title": "rosetta-flash jsonp vulnerability",
  "Description": "Someone created a alphanum only swf converter, which means that they can in theory use it as a callback at a JSONP endpoint, and as a result, send data across domains. Prepending callbacks with an empty inline comment breaks the flash parser, and prevents the issue. This is a fairly common solution currently being implemented by Google, Facebook, and Github.",
