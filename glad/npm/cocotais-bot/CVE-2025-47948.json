  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-47948",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/cocotais-bot",
  "Title": "Cocotais Bot has builtin .echo command injection",
  "Description": "A command echoing feature in the framework allows users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags. Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo \u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e` command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems.",
