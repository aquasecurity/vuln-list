  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-43864",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/react-router",
  "Title": "React Router allows a DoS via cache poisoning by forcing SPA mode",
  "Description": "After some research, it turns out that it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application.",
