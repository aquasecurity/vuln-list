  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-8267",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/ssrfcheck",
  "Title": "ssrfcheck has Incomplete IP Address Deny List that leads to Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability",
  "Description": "Versions of the package ssrfcheck before 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to an incomplete denylist of IP address ranges. Specifically, the package fails to classify the reserved IP address space 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast) as invalid. This oversight allows attackers to craft requests targeting these multicast addresses.",
