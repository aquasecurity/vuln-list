  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-42640",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/angular-base64-upload",
  "Title": "angular-base64-upload vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution",
  "Description": "angular-base64-upload versions prior to v0.1.21 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution via the `angular-base64-upload/demo/server.php` endpoint. Exploitation of this vulnerability involves uploading arbitrary file content to the server, which can subsequently accessed through the `angular-base64-upload/demo/uploads` endpoint. This leads to the execution of previously uploaded content which enables the attacker to achieve code execution on the server.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
