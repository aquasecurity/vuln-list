  "Title": "Forgeable Public/Private Tokens",
  "Description": "\"algorithm\" isn't enforced in jwt.decode() and a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.",
