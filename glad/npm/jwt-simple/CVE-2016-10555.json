  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-10555",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/jwt-simple",
  "Title": "Forgeable Public/Private Tokens in jwt-simple",
  "Description": "Since \"algorithm\" isn't enforced in jwt.decode()in jwt-simple 0.3.0 and earlier, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.",
