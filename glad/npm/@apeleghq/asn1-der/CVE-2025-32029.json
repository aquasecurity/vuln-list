  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-32029",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@apeleghq/asn1-der",
  "Title": "ts-asn1-der has Incorrect DER Encoding of Numbers Leading to Denial of Service and Incorrect Value Representation",
  "Description": "Incorrect `number` DER encoding can lead to denial on service for absolute values in the range `2**31` -- `2**32 - 1`. The arithmetic in the `numBitLen` didn't take into account that values in this range could result in a negative result upon applying the `\u003e\u003e` operator, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nIn addition, `number` encoding had a few other issues that resulted it in it not encoding values correctly.",
