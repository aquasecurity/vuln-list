  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62713",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@kottster/server",
  "Title": "Kottster app reinitialization can be re-triggered allowing command injection in development mode",
  "Description": "**Development mode only**. Kottster contains a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability when running in development mode.\n\nThe vulnerability combines two issues:\n1. The `initApp` action can be called repeatedly without checking if the app is already initialized, allowing attackers to create a new root admin account and obtain a JWT token\n2. The `installPackagesForDataSource` action uses unescaped command arguments, enabling command injection\n\nAn attacker with access to a locally running development instance can chain these vulnerabilities to:\n- Reinitialize the application and receive a JWT token for a new root account\n- Use this token to authenticate\n- Execute arbitrary system commands through `installPackagesForDataSource`\n\n**Production deployments were never affected.**",
