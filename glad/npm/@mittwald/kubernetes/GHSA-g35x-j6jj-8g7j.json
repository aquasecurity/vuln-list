  "Title": "@mittwald/kubernetes's secret contents leaked via debug logging",
  "Description": "When debug logging is enabled (via `DEBUG` environment variable), the Kubernetes client may log all response bodies into the debug log -- including sensitive data from `Secret` resources.\n\nWhen running in a Kubernetes cluster, this might expose sensitive information to users who are _not_ authorised to access secrets, but have access to Pod logs (either directly using kubectl, or by Pod logs being shipped elsewhere).\n\nUpgrade to 3.5.0 or newer.\n\n Workaround\nDisable debug logging entirely, or exclude the `kubernetes:client` debug item (for example, using `DEBUG=*,-kubernetes:client`).\n\n- https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html\n",
