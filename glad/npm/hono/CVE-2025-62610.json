  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62610",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/hono",
  "Title": "Hono Improper Authorization vulnerability",
  "Description": "Hono’s **JWT Auth Middleware does not provide a built-in `aud` (Audience) verification option**, which can cause **confused-deputy / token-mix-up** issues: an API may accept a valid token that was **issued for a different audience** (e.g., another service) when multiple services share the same issuer/keys. This can lead to unintended cross-service access. Hono’s docs list verification options for `iss/nbf/iat/exp` only, with **no `aud` support**; RFC 7519 requires that when an `aud` claim is present, tokens **MUST** be rejected unless the processing party identifies itself in that claim.\n\n**Note:** This problem likely exists in the **JWK/JWKS-based middleware** as well (e.g., `jwk` / `verifyWithJwks`)",
