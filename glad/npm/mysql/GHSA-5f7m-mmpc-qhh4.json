  "Title": "Remote Memory Exposure in mysql",
  "Description": "Versions of `mysql` before 2.14.0 is vulnerable to remove memory exposure.\n\nAffected versions of `mysql` package allocate and send an uninitialized memory over the network when a number is provided as a password.\n\nOnly `mysql` running on Node.js versions below 6.0.0 is affected due to a throw added in newer node.js versions.\n\nProof of Concept:\n\n```\nrequire('mysql').createConnection({\n host: 'localhost',\n user: 'user',\n password : USERPROVIDEDINPUT, // number\n database : 'my_db'\n}).connect();\n```\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 2.14.0 or later.",
