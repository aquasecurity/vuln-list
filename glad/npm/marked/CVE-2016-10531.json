  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-10531",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/marked",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "Due to the way that marked parses input, specifically HTML entities, it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`) to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because `\u0026#xNNanything;` gets parsed to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being left.",
