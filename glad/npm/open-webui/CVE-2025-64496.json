  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64496",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/open-webui",
  "Title": "Open WebUI Affected by an External Model Server (Direct Connections) Code Injection via SSE Events",
  "Description": "Open WebUI v0.6.33 and below contains a code injection vulnerability in the Direct Connections feature that allows malicious external model servers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim browsers via Server-Sent Event (SSE) `execute` events. This leads to authentication token theft, complete account takeover, and when chained with the Functions API, enables remote code execution on the backend server. The attack requires the victim to enable Direct Connections (disabled by default) and add the attacker's malicious model URL, achievable through social engineering of the admin and subsequent users.",
