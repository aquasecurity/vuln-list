  "PackageSlug": "npm/parse-server",
  "Title": "Parse Server Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in File Upload via URI Format",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload functionality when trying to upload a `Parse.File` with `uri` parameter allows to execute an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response.",
