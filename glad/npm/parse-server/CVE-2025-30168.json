{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-30168",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/parse-server",
  "Title": "Parse Server has an OAuth login vulnerability",
  "Description": "The 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option `auth` to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. See the [3rd party authentication docs](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#oauth-and-3rd-party-authentication) for more information on which authentication providers are affected.",
