  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-29017",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/vm2",
  "Title": "Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources",
  "Description": "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with allow listed Node's built-in modules. Prior to version 3.9.15, vm2 was not properly handling host objects passed to `Error.prepareStackTrace` in case of unhandled async errors. A threat actor could bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version 3.9.15 of vm2. There are no known workarounds.",
