  "Title": "URL parsing in node-forge could lead to undesired behavior.",
  "Description": "### Impact\nThe regex used for the `forge.util.parseUrl` API would not properly parse certain inputs resulting in a parsed data structure that could lead to undesired behavior.\n\n### Patches\n`forge.util.parseUrl` and other very old related URL APIs were removed in 1.0.0 in favor of letting applications use the more modern WHATWG URL Standard API.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure code does not directly or indirectly call `forge.util.parseUrl` with untrusted input.\n\n### References\n- https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/41852c50-3c6d-4703-8c55-4db27164a4ae/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge)\n* Email us at support@digitalbazaar.com\n",
