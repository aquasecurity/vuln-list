  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27152",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/axios",
  "Title": "axios Requests Vulnerable To Possible SSRF and Credential Leakage via Absolute URL",
  "Description": "A previously reported issue in axios demonstrated that using protocol-relative URLs could lead to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).\nReference: axios/axios#6463\n\nA similar problem that occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios has been identified. Even if ‚Å†`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.",
