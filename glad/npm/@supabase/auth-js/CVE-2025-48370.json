  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-48370",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@supabase/auth-js",
  "Title": "auth-js Vulnerable to Insecure Path Routing from Malformed User Input",
  "Description": "The library functions `getUserById`, `deleteUser`, `updateUserById`, `listFactors` and `deleteFactor` did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API function being called.\n\nImplementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the `userId` are not affected by this.",
