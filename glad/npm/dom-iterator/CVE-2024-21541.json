  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-21541",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/dom-iterator",
  "Title": "dom-iterator code execution vulnerability",
  "Description": "Versions of the package dom-iterator before 1.0.1 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete input sanitization. Function generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval.",
