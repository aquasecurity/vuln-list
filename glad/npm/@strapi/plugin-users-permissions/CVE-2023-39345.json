  "PackageSlug": "npm/@strapi/plugin-users-permissions",
  "Title": "Unauthorized Access to Private Fields in User Registration API",
  "Description": "### System Details\n| Name   | Value         |\n|----------|------------------------|\n| OS    | Windows 11       |\n| Version | 4.11.1 (node v16.14.2) |\n| Database | mysql         |\n\n\n### Description\nI marked some fields as private fields in user content-type, and tried to register as a new user via api, at the same time I added content to fill the private fields and sent a post request, and as you can see from the images below, I can write to the private fields.\n\n To prevent this, I went to the extension area and tried to extend the register method, for this I wanted to do it using the sanitizeInput function that I know in the source codes of the strap. But the sanitizeInput function does not filter out private fields.\n\n```js\n const { auth } = ctx.state;\n const data = ctx.request.body;\n const userSchema = strapi.getModel(\"plugin::users-permissions.user\");\n\n sanitize.contentAPI.input(data, userSchema, { auth });\n```\n\nhere's the solution I've temporarily kept to myself, code snippet\n\n```js\n const body = ctx.request.body;\n\n const { attributes } = strapi.getModel(\"plugin::users-permissions.user\");\n\n const sanitizedData = _.omitBy(body, (data, key) =\u003e {\n  const attribute = attributes[key];\n\n  if (_.isNil(attribute)) {\n   return false;\n  }\n\n  //? If you want, you can throw an error for fields that we does not expect.\n\n  // if (_.isNil(attribute))\n  //  throw new ApplicationError(`Unexpected value ${key}`);\n\n  // if private value is true, we do not want to send it to the database.\n  return attribute.private;\n });\n\n return sanitizedData;\n```\n\n",
