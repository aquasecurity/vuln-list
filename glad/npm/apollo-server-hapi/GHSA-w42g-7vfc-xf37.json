  "Title": "Introspection in schema validation in Apollo Server",
  "Description": "If `subscriptions: false` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, there is no impact. If implementors were not expecting validation rules to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable. If `introspection: true` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user-provided validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) sinceÂ there would be no expectation that introspection was disabled.",
