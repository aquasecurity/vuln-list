  "PackageSlug": "npm/@apollo/composition",
  "Title": "Apollo Federation has Improper Enforcement of Access Control on Transitive Fields",
  "Description": "A vulnerability in Apollo Federation's composition logic did not enforce that fields depending on protected data through `@requires` and/or `@fromContext` directives have the same access control requirements as the fields they reference. This allowed queries to access protected fields indirectly through their dependencies, bypassing access control checks. A fix to composition logic in Federation now enforces that dependent fields match the access control requirements from of the fields they reference.",
