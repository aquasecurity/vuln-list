  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64530",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@apollo/composition",
  "Title": "@apollo/composition has Improper Enforcement of Access Control on Interface Types and Fields",
  "Description": "A vulnerability in Apollo Federation's composition logic allowed some queries to Apollo Router to improperly bypass access controls on types/fields. Apollo Federation incorrectly allowed user-defined access control directives on interface types/fields, which could be bypassed by instead querying the implementing object types/fields in Apollo Router via inline or named fragments. A fix to composition logic in Federation now disallows interfaces types and fields to contain user-defined access control directives.",
