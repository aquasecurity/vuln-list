  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-58765",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@webrecorder/archivewebpage",
  "Title": "Webrecorder packages are vulnerable to XSS through 404 error handling logic",
  "Description": "A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 404 error handling logic of wabac.js v2.23.10 and below. The parameter `requestURL` (derived from the original request target) is directly embedded into an inline `\u003cscript\u003e` block without sanitization or escaping.\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser.\n\nThe scope may be limited by CORS policies, depending on the situation in which wabac.js is used.",
