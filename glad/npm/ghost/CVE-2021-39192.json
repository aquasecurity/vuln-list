  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-39192",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/ghost",
  "Title": "Improper Privilege Management",
  "Description": "Ghost is a Node.js content management system. An error in the implementation of the limits service allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. As a workaround, disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access. It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround.",
