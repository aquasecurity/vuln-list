  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-31133",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/ghost",
  "Title": "Ghost vulnerable to information disclosure of private API fields",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nDue to a lack of validation when filtering on the public API endpoints, it is possible to reveal private fields via a brute force attack.\n\nGhost(Pro) has already been patched. We can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added.\n\nSelf-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version below v5.46.1. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site - see patches and workarounds below.\n\n### Patches\n\nv5.46.1 contains a fix for this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAdd a block for requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` where the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Email us at [security@ghost.org](mailto:security@ghost.org)",
