  "Title": "Remote command injection when using sendmail email transport",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nSites using the `sendmail` transport as part of their `mail` config are vulnerable to remote command injection due to a [vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-48ww-j4fc-435p) in the `nodemailer` dependency.\n\nGhost defaults to the `direct` transport so this is only exploitable if the `sendmail` transport is explicitly used.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 4.15.0, all sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Use an alternative email transport as described in the [docs](https://ghost.org/docs/config/#mail). \n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* email us at security@ghost.org\n",
