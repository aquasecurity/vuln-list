  "PackageSlug": "npm/socket.io-file",
  "Title": "File restriction bypass in socket.io-file",
  "Description": "All versions of `socket.io-file`are vulnerable to a file restriction bypass. The validation for valid file types only happens on the client-side, which allows an attacker to intercept the Websocket request post-validation and alter the `name` value to upload any file types.\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
