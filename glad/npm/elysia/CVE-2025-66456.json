  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66456",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/elysia",
  "Title": "Elysia vulnerable to prototype pollution with multiple standalone schema validation",
  "Description": "Prototype pollution vulnerability in `mergeDeep` after merging results of two standard schema validations with the same key. Due to the ordering of merging, there must be an `any` type that is set as a `standalone` guard, to allow for the `__proto__` prop to be merged.\n\nWhen combined with GHSA-8vch-m3f4-q8jf this allows for a full RCE by an attacker.",
