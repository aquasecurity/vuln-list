{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54782",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@nestjs/devtools-integration",
  "Title": "@nestjs/devtools-integration: CSRF to Sandbox Escape Allows for RCE against JS Developers",
  "Description": "A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the `@nestjs/devtools-integration` package. When enabled, the package exposes a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (`safe-eval`-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine.\n\nA full blog post about how this vulnerability was uncovered can be found on [Socket's blog](https://socket.dev/blog/nestjs-rce-vuln).",
