  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45389",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/pagefind",
  "Title": "DOM clobbering could escalate to Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Description": "Pagefind initializes its dynamic JavaScript and WebAssembly files relative to the location of the first script you load. This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`.\n\nIt is possible to \"clobber\" this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page, for example:\n```html\n\u003cimg name=\"currentScript\" src=\"blob:https://xxx.xxx.xxx/ui.js\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n```\n\nThis will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain, which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies.\n\nThis exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to your live, hosted, website. In these cases, this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example, `img` tags with a `name` attribute), but not others, as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the XSS vector.\n\nPagefind has tightened this resolution by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element. There are no reports of this being exploited in the wild via Pagefind.",
