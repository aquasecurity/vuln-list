  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-9287",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/cipher-base",
  "Title": "cipher-base is missing type checks, leading to hash rewind and passing on crafted data",
  "Description": "This affects e.g. `create-hash` (and `crypto-browserify`), so I'll describe the issue against that package\nAlso affects `create-hmac` and other packages\n\nNode.js `createHash` works only on strings or instances of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView.\n\nMissing input type checks (in npm `create-hash` polyfill of Node.js `createHash`) can allow types other than a well-formed `Buffer` or `string`, resulting in invalid values, hanging and rewinding the hash state (including turning a tagged hash into an untagged hash), or other generally undefined behaviour.",
