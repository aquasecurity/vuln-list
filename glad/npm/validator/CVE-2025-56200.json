  "PackageSlug": "npm/validator",
  "Title": "validator.js has a URL validation bypass vulnerability in its isURL function",
  "Description": "A URL validation bypass vulnerability exists in validator.js prior to version 13.15.20. The isURL() function uses '://' as a delimiter to parse protocols, while browsers use ':' as the delimiter. This parsing difference allows attackers to bypass protocol and domain validation by crafting URLs leading to XSS and Open Redirect attacks.",
