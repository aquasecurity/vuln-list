  "Identifier": "GMS-2016-74",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/sails",
  "Title": "Broken CORS",
  "Description": "Sails has an issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. This would allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through cross site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy. Note that this is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. The problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided. At that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.",

  "AffectedRange": "\u003c0.12.7",
  "FixedVersions": [
    "0.12.7"
  ],
  "AffectedVersions": "All versions before 0.12.7",
  "NotImpacted": "",
  "Solution": "When using Sails make sure to double check your CORS configuration. A misconfiguration in a production environment will result in a error message being written to the node process console upon application start in versions 0.12.7 and higher.",
