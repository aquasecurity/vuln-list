  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-1000223",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/jws",
  "Title": "Forgeable Public/Private Tokens in jws",
  "Description": "Affected versions of the `jws` package allow users to select what algorithm the server will use to verify a provided JWT. A malicious actor can use this behaviour to arbitrarily modify the contents of a JWT while still passing verification. For the common use case of the JWT as a bearer token, the end result is a complete authentication bypass with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 3.0.0 or later.",
