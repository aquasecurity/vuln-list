  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15170",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/ctrip-apollo",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "apollo-adminservice does not implement access controls. If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it does not have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to `access/edit` the application's configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.",
