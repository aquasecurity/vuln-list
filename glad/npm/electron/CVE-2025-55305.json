{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-55305",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/electron",
  "Title": "Electron has ASAR Integrity Bypass via resource modification",
  "Description": "This only impacts apps that have the `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` [fuses](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses) enabled.  Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted.\n\nSpecifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too.  i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `resources` folder in your app installation on Windows which these fuses are supposed to protect against.",
