  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-39184",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/electron",
  "Title": "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere",
  "Description": "Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability allows a sandboxed renderer to request a `thumbnail` image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.",
