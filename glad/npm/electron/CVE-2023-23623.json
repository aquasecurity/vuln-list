  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-23623",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/electron",
  "Title": "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation",
  "Description": "Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A ``Content-Security-Policy`` that disables eval, specifically setting a `script-src` directive and _not_ providing `unsafe-eval` in that directive, is not respected in renderers that have sandbox disabled. i.e. `sandbox: false` in the `webPreferences` object. This allows usage of methods like `eval()` and `new Function` unexpectedly which can result in an expanded attack surface. This issue only ever affected the 22 and 23 major versions of Electron and has been fixed in the latest versions of those release lines. Specifically, these versions contain the fixes: 22.0.1 and 23.0.0-alpha.2 We recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by enabling `sandbox: true` on all renderers.",
