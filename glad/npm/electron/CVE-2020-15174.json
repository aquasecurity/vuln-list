  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15174",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/electron",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "In Electron the `will-navigate` event that apps use to prevent navigations to unexpected destinations as per our security recommendations can be bypassed when a sub-frame performs a top-frame navigation across sites. The issue is patched As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute. This will prevent them creating top-frame navigations and is good practice anyway.",
