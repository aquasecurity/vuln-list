  "PackageSlug": "npm/csrf-lite",
  "Title": "Non-Constant Time String Comparison",
  "Description": "csrf-lite uses `===`, a fail first string comparison, instead of a time constant string comparison. This enables an attacker being able to calculate minuscule differences in CSRF tokens, essentially enabling them to guess the token one character at a time Each check increases the variable `tempCheck` by one. If a malicious user is able to see what `tempCheck` is at each run (how long it takes to do a check), then they can see when it increases. This increase indicates that the character they just put in for `csrfTokenCompare` is the correct one.",
