  "Title": "Prototype pollution in jsii.configureCategories",
  "Description": "`jsii` is a TypeScript to JavaScript compiler that also extracts an interface definition manifest to generate RPC stubs in various programming languages. jsii is typically used as a command-line tool, but it can also be loaded as a library.\nWhen loaded as a library into a larger application, prototype pollution may happen if untrusted user input is passed to the library. When used as a command line-tool, this pollution cannot occur.",
