  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62427",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@angular/ssr",
  "Title": "Angular SSR has a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw",
  "Description": "The vulnerability is a **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** flaw within the URL resolution mechanism of Angular's Server-Side Rendering package (`@angular/ssr`).\n\nThe function `createRequestUrl` uses the native `URL` constructor. When an incoming request path (e.g., `originalUrl` or `url`) begins with a **double forward slash (`//`) or backslash (`\\\\`)**, the `URL` constructor treats it as a **schema-relative URL**. This behavior overrides the security-intended base URL (protocol, host, and port) supplied as the second argument, instead resolving the URL against the scheme of the base URL but adopting the attacker-controlled hostname.\n\nThis allows an attacker to specify an external domain in the URL path, tricking the Angular SSR environment into setting the page's virtual location (accessible via `DOCUMENT` or `PlatformLocation` tokens) to this attacker-controlled domain. Any subsequent **relative HTTP requests** made during the SSR process (e.g., using `HttpClient.get('assets/data.json')`) will be incorrectly resolved against the attacker's domain, forcing the server to communicate with an arbitrary external endpoint.",
