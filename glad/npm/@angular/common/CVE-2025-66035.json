  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66035",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@angular/common",
  "Title": "Angular is Vulnerable to XSRF Token Leakage via Protocol-Relative URLs in Angular HTTP Client",
  "Description": "The vulnerability is a **Credential Leak by App Logic** that leads to the **unauthorized disclosure of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) token** to an attacker-controlled domain.\n\nAngular's HttpClient has a built-in XSRF protection mechanism that works by checking if a request URL starts with a protocol (`http://` or `https://`) to determine if it is cross-origin. If the URL starts with protocol-relative URL (`//`), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token is automatically added to the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header.",
