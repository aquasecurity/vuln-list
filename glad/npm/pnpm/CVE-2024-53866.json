  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-53866",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/pnpm",
  "Title": "pnpm no-script global cache poisoning via overrides / `ignore-scripts` evasion",
  "Description": "pnpm seems to mishandle overrides and global cache:\n1. Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken",
