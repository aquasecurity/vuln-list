{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-42740",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/shell-quote",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')",
  "Description": "The shell-quote package for Node.js allows command injection. An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z case letter a, such as the backtick character.",
