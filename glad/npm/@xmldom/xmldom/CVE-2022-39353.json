  "Description": "### Impact\nxmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing.\nThis breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node in the tree, which led to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39299 and is a potential issue for dependents.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to `@xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7`, `@xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4` (dist-tag `latest`) or `@xmldom/xmldom@\u003e=0.9.0-beta.4` (dist-tag `next`).\n\n### Workarounds\nOne of the following approaches might help, depending on your use case:\n- Instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search in the `documentElement`.\n- Reject a document with a document that has more then 1 `childNode`.\n\n### References\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39299\n- https://github.com/jindw/xmldom/issues/150\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at security@xmldom.org\n",
