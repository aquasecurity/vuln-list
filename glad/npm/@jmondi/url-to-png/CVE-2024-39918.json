  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-39918",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@jmondi/url-to-png",
  "Title": "@jmondi/url-to-png contains a Path Traversal vulnerability",
  "Description": "When trying to add a `BLOCK_LIST` feature when the maintainer noticed they didn't sanitize the `ImageId` in the code, which leads to path traversal vulnerability. Now, this is different from a traditional path traversal issue, because as of NOW you can store the image in any place arbitrarily, and given enough time they might be able to come up with a working exploit BUT for the time being they am reporting this.",
