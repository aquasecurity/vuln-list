  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-46234",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/browserify-sign",
  "Title": "browserify-sign upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` leads to a signature forgery attack",
  "Description": "browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of node's crypto public key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutny's work on indutny/tls.js. An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack. All places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.2.\n",
