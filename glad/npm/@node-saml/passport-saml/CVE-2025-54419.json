  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54419",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@node-saml/passport-saml",
  "Title": "Node-SAML SAML Signature Verification Vulnerability",
  "Description": "Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature.\n\nThis allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username.\n\nTo conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP).\n\nIn fixing this we made sure to process the SAML assertions from only verified/authenticated contents. This will prevent future variants from coming up.\n\nNote: this is distinct from the previous xml-crypto CVEs.",
