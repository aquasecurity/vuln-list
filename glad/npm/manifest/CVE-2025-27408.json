  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27408",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/manifest",
  "Title": "Manifest Uses a One-Way Hash without a Salt",
  "Description": "Manifest employs a weak password hashing implementation that uses SHA3 without a salt. This exposes user passwords to a higher risk of being cracked if an attacker gains access to the database. Without the use of a salt, identical passwords across multiple users will result in the same hash, making it easier for attackers to identify and exploit patterns, thereby accelerating the cracking process.",
