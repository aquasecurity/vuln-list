  "PackageSlug": "npm/@nyariv/sandboxjs",
  "Title": "@nyariv/sandboxjs has Prototype Pollution vulnerability that may lead to RCE",
  "Description": "A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in @nyariv/sandboxjs versions \u003c= 0.8.23, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into Object.prototype via crafted JavaScript code. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or, under certain conditions, escape the sandboxed environment intended to restrict code execution. The vulnerability stems from insufficient prototype access checks in the sandboxâ€™s executor logic, particularly in the handling of JavaScript function objects returned.",
