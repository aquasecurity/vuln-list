  "PackageSlug": "npm/web3",
  "Title": "Insecure Credential Storage in web3",
  "Description": "All versions of `web3` are vulnerable to Insecure Credential Storage. The package stores encrypted wallets in local storage and requires a password to load the wallet. Once the wallet is loaded, the private key is accessible via LocalStorage. Exploiting this vulnerability likely requires a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability to access the private key. No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
