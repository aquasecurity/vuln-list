  "Title": "Server-Side Request Forgery in html-pdf-chrome",
  "Description": "All versions of `html-pdf-chrome` is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The package executes HTTP requests if the parsed HTML contains external references to resources, such as `\u003ciframe src=\"http://localhost\" height=\"800px\" width=\"800px\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e`. This allows attackers to access resources through HTTP that are accessible to the server, including private resources in the hosting environment. ## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
