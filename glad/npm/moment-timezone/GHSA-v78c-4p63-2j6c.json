  "PackageSlug": "npm/moment-timezone",
  "Title": "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information in moment-timezone",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\n* if Alice uses `grunt data` (or `grunt release`) to prepare a custom-build, moment-timezone with the latest tzdata from IANA's website\n* and Mallory intercepts the request to IANA's unencrypted ftp server, Mallory can serve data which might exploit further stages of the moment-timezone tzdata pipeline, or potentially produce a tainted version of moment-timezone (practicality of such attacks is not proved)\n\n### Patches\nProblem has been patched in version 0.5.35, patch should be applicable with minor modifications to all affected versions. The patch includes changing the FTP endpoint with an HTTPS endpoint.\n\n### Workarounds\nSpecify the exact version of tzdata (like `2014d`, full command being `grunt data:2014d`, then run the rest of the release tasks by hand), or just apply the patch before issuing the grunt command.\n",
