  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66482",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/misskey-js",
  "Title": "Misskey has a login rate limit bypass via spoofed X-Forwarded-For header",
  "Description": "When using an untrusted reverse proxy or not using a reverse proxy at all, attackers can bypass IP rate limiting by adding a forged X-Forwarded-For header. Starting with version 2025.9.1, an option (`trustProxy`) has been added in config file to prevent this from happening. However, it is initialized with an insecure default value before version 2025.12.0, making it still vulnerable if the configuration is not set correctly.",
