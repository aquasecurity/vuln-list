  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-25572",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/react-admin",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
  "Description": "react-admin is a frontend framework for building browser applications on top of REST/GraphQL APIs. react-admin prior to versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, along with ra-ui-materialui prior to 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. All React applications built with react-admin and using the `\u003cRichTextField\u003e` are affected. `\u003cRichTextField\u003e` outputs the field value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't sanitized server-side, this opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround, users may replace the `\u003cRichTextField\u003e` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand.",
