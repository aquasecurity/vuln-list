  "PackageSlug": "npm/@soketi/soketi",
  "Title": "Denial of Service in soketi",
  "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThere was a wrong behavior when reading POST requests, making the server crash if it couldn't read the body. In case a POST request was sent to any endpoint of the server with an empty body, **even unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol**, it would simply just crash the server for trying to send a response after the request closed.\n\nAll users that run the server are affected by it and it's highly recommended to upgrade to the latest patch.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nUpdating to at least or the latest version.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nNo. Upgrading is the only solution.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nhttps://github.com/soketi/soketi/releases/tag/0.24.1\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the issues board](https://github.com/soketi/soketi/issues)\n* Email us at [alex@renoki.org](mailto:alex@renoki.org)\n",
