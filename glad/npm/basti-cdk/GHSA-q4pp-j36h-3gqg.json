  "Title": "Minimal `basti` IAM Policy Allows Shell Access",
  "Description": "### Summary\n\nThe provided Minimal IAM Policy for `bastic connect` does not include `ssm:SessionDocumentAccessCheck`. This results in the ability to get a shell session on the bastion, not just the intended access for Port Forwarding.\n\n### Details\n\n`basti connect` is designed to \"securely connect to your RDS/Aurora/Elasticache/EC2 instances\", using a bastion instance \"with [AWS Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) port forwarding capability to make the target available on your localhost.\"\n\nThe [Minimal IAM Policy](https://github.com/BohdanPetryshyn/basti#minimal-iam-permissions) allows port forwarding via the following statement:\n\n```  \n {\n   \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n   \"Action\": \"ssm:StartSession\",\n   \"Resource\": [\n \"arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost\",\n    \"arn:aws:ec2:\u003cyour-region\u003e:\u003cyour-account-id\u003e:instance/\u003cyour-basti-instance-id\u003e\"\n   ]\n  }\n```\n\nThis statement does not include the following condition:\n\n```\n\"Condition\": {\n  \"BoolIfExists\": {\n    \"ssm:SessionDocumentAccessCheck\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs a result, the `basti connect` minimal policy is logically identical to:\n\n```\n {\n   \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n   \"Action\": \"ssm:StartSession\",\n   \"Resource\": [\n    \"arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost\",\n    \"arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/SSM-SessionManagerRunShell\",\n \"arn:aws:ec2:\u003cyour-region\u003e:\u003cyour-account-id\u003e:instance/\u003cyour-basti-instance-id\u003e\"\n   ]\n  }\n```\n\nA `basti` admin would expect users under the minimal policy to be able to port forward. However, they could also get a shell on the bastion.\n\nFor more details on this footgun, see: https://ramimac.me/ssm-iam\n\n### PoC\n_Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._ \n\n### Impact\n\nImpact would depend on configuration/hardening of the bastion. I've seen examples where bastions have credentials to downstream systems in configuration or memory that would be exposed. ",
