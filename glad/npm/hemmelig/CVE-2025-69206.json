  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-69206",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/hemmelig",
  "Title": "hemmelig allows SSRF Filter bypass via Secret Request functionality",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) filter bypass vulnerability exists in the webhook URL validation of the Secret Requests feature. The application attempts to block internal/private IP addresses but can be bypassed using DNS rebinding (e.g., `localtest.me` which resolves to `127.0.0.1`) or open redirect services (e.g., `httpbin.org/redirect-to`). This allows an authenticated user to make the server initiate HTTP requests to internal network resources.",
