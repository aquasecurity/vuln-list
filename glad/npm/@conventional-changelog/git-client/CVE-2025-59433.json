  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59433",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@conventional-changelog/git-client",
  "Title": "@conventional-changelog/git-client has Argument Injection vulnerability",
  "Description": "While the scope is only limited to writing a file with input from the git log result, it still allows to specify and overwrite any arbitrary files on disk, such as `.env` or as far as critical system configuration at `/etc` if the application is running as privileged `root` user.\n\nIt may be the library's design choice to expose a generic `params` object to allow any consuming users to specify random Git command line arguments, however it could be abused by attackers when developers aren't aware of the security risks which aren't communicated. As such, I recommend not ignoring, and either patching this insecure design gap with hardened secure coding practices (like in other APIs mentioned previously) or adding a security disclaimer to this library's documentation.",
