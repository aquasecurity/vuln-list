  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54584",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@finos/git-proxy",
  "Title": "GitProxy Backfile Parsing Exploit",
  "Description": "An attacker can craft a malicious Git packfile to exploit the PACK signature detection in the `parsePush.ts`. By embedding a misleading PACK signature within commit content and carefully constructing the packet structure, the attacker can trick the parser into treating invalid or unintended data as the packfile. Potentially, this would allow bypassing approval or hiding commits.",
