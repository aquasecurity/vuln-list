  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-22491",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/gatsby-transformer-remark",
  "Title": "gatsby-transformer-remark has possible unsanitized JavaScript code injection",
  "Description": "### Impact\nThe gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized. The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL). Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark. The following payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id \u003e\u003e /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine. The patch introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default. When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized before processing to avoid a security risk. Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true` or if it appears that the MarkdownRemark input is attempting to use the Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com).",
