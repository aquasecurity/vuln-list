{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15168",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/node-fetch",
  "Title": "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling",
  "Description": "node-fetch did not honor the size option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError would never get thrown and the process would end without failure. For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after `fetch()` has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.",
