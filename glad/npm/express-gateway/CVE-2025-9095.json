  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-9095",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/express-gateway",
  "Title": "ExpressGateway Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in lib/rest/routes/users.js",
  "Description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue exists in ExpressGateway up to 1.16.10 in the REST endpoint implemented in lib/rest/routes/users.js. User-controlled input is reflected into the HTTP response without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser of a logged-in user who views the affected page/route. The attack can be triggered over the network with low complexity and requires a low-privileged authenticated context and user interaction (viewing the page). Impact is limited to confidentiality and integrity of the session in the affected UI.",
