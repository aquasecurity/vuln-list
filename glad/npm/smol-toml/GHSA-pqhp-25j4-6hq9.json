  "Title": "smol-toml has a Denial of Service via malicious TOML document using deeply nested inline tables",
  "Description": "An attacker can send a maliciously crafted TOML to cause the parser to crash because of a stack overflow caused by a deeply nested inline structure. A similar problem occurs when attempting to stringify deeply nested objects.\n\nThe library does not limit the maximum exploration depth while parsing or producing TOML documents, nor does it offer a way to do so.",
