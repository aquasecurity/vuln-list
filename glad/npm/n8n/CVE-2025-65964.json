{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-65964",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/n8n",
  "Title": "n8n vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Git Node Custom Pre-Commit Hook",
  "Description": "The n8n Git node allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values through the _Add Config_ operation. When an attacker-controlled workflow sets `core.hooksPath` to a directory within the cloned repository containing a Git hook such as `pre-commit`, Git executes that hook during subsequent Git operations. Because Git hooks run as local system commands, this behavior can lead to **arbitrary command execution** on the underlying n8n host.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow that uses the Git node.\n\nAffected versions: **≥ 0.123.1 and \u003c 1.119.2**",
