  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68697",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/n8n",
  "Title": "Self-hosted n8n has Legacy Code node that enables arbitrary file read/write",
  "Description": "In self-hosted n8n instances where the Code node runs in legacy (non-task-runner) JavaScript execution mode, authenticated users with workflow editing access can invoke internal helper functions from within the Code node.\n\nThis allows a workflow editor to perform actions on the n8n host with the same privileges as the n8n process, including:\n\n- Reading files from the host filesystem (subject to any file-access restrictions configured on the instance and OS/container permissions)\n- Writing files to the host filesystem (subject to the same restrictions)\n\nStarting with n8n version 1.2.1, access to files in the n8n home directory (`.n8n`) is blocked by default. However, this does not restrict access to other parts of the filesystem unless additional file access limitations are configured.",
