  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-52478",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/n8n",
  "Title": "Stored XSS in n8n Form Trigger allows Account Takeover via injected iframe and video/source",
  "Description": "A stored **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was identified in [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), specifically in the **Form Trigger** node's **HTML form element**. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML via an `\u003ciframe\u003e` with a `srcdoc` payload that includes arbitrary JavaScript execution. The attacker can also inject malicious Javascript by using `\u003cvideo\u003e` coupled `\u003csource\u003e` using an `onerror` event.\n\nWhile using `iframe` or a combination of `video` and `source` tag, this vulnerability allows for Account Takeover (ATO) by exfiltrating `n8n-browserId` and session cookies from authenticated users who visit a maliciously crafted form. Using these tokens and cookies, an attacker can impersonate the victim and change account details such as email addresses, enabling full control over the accountâ€”especially if 2FA is not enabled.",
