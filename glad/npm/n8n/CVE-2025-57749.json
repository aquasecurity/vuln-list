  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-57749",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/n8n",
  "Title": "n8n symlink traversal vulnerability in \"Read/Write File\" node allows access to restricted files",
  "Description": "A symlink traversal vulnerability was discovered in the `Read/Write File` node in n8n. While the node attempts to restrict access to sensitive directories and files, it does not properly account for symbolic links (symlinks). An attacker with the ability to create symlinks—such as by using the `Execute Command` node—could exploit this to bypass the intended directory restrictions and read from or write to otherwise inaccessible paths. Users of _n8n.cloud_ are not impacted.",
