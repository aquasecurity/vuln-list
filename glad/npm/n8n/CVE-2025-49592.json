  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-49592",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/n8n",
  "Title": "n8n allows open redirects via the /signin endpoint",
  "Description": "This is an Open Redirect (CWE-601) vulnerability in the login flow of n8n. Authenticated users can be redirected to untrusted, attacker-controlled domains after logging in, by crafting malicious URLs with a misleading redirect query parameter.\n\nThis may lead to:\n\n- Phishing attacks by impersonating the n8n UI on lookalike domains (e.g., n8n.local.evil.com)\n- Credential or 2FA theft if users are tricked into re-entering sensitive information\n- Reputation risk due to the visual similarity between attacker-controlled domains and trusted ones\n\nThe vulnerability affects anyone hosting n8n and exposing the `/signin` endpoint to users.",
