  "Title": "Directory Traversal in featurebook",
  "Description": "Affected versions of `featurebook` resolve relative file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\nThe `featurebook` package is not intended to be run in production code nor to be exposed to an untrusted network.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```\nGET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo direct patch is currently available.\n\nAt this time, the best mitigation is to ensure that `featurebook` is not running in production or exposed to an untrusted network.",
