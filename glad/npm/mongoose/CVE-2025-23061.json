  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-23061",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/mongoose",
  "Title": "Mongoose search injection vulnerability",
  "Description": "Mongoose versions prior to 8.9.5, 7.8.4, and 6.13.6 are vulnerable to improper use of the `$where` operator. This vulnerability arises from the ability of the `$where` clause to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in MongoDB queries, potentially leading to code injection attacks and unauthorized access or manipulation of database data.\n\nNOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-53900.",
