  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47764",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/cookie",
  "Title": "cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters",
  "Description": "The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize(\"userName=\u003cscript\u003ealert('XSS3')\u003c/script\u003e; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=\u003cscript\u003ealert('XSS3')\u003c/script\u003e; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `\u003cscript\u003e` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.",
