  "Description": "When nanoid is called with a fractional value, there were a number of undesirable effects:\n\n1. in browser and non-secure, the code infinite loops on while (size--)\n2. in node, the value of poolOffset becomes fractional, causing calls to nanoid to return zeroes until the pool is next filled\n3. if the first call in node is a fractional argument, the initial buffer allocation fails with an error\n\nVersion 3.3.8 and 5.0.9 are fixed.",
