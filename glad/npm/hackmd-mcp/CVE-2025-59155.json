  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59155",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/hackmd-mcp",
  "Title": "HackMD MCP Server has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that affects all users running the HackMD MCP server in HTTP mode. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by passing arbitrary `hackmdApiUrl` values through HTTP headers (`Hackmd-Api-Url`) or base64-encoded JSON query parameters. This allows malicious users to:\n\n- Redirect API calls to internal network services\n- Potentially access sensitive internal endpoints\n- Perform network reconnaissance through the server\n- Bypass network access controls\n\nThe vulnerability affects the HTTP transport mode specifically - stdio mode is not impacted as it only accepts requests from stdio.",
