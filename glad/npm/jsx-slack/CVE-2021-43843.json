  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-43843",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/jsx-slack",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "jsx-slack is a package for building JSON objects for Slack block kit surfaces from JSX. The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `\u003cblockquote\u003e` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `\u003cblockquote\u003e` with multibyte characters.",
