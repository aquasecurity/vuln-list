  "Title": "PsiTransfer has Zip Slip Path Traversal via TAR Archive Download",
  "Description": "A Zip Slip vulnerability in PsiTransfer allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload files with path traversal sequences in the filename (e.g. `../../../.ssh/authorized_keys`). When a victim downloads the bucket as a **.tar.gz** archive and extracts it, malicious files are written outside the intended directory, potentially leading to RCE.",
