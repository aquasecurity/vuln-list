  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-46653",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/formidable",
  "Title": "Formidable relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content",
  "Description": "Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.x before 2.1.3 and 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented as not \"cryptographically secure.\" (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.",
