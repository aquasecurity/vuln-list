  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-48948",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/elliptic",
  "Title": "Valid ECDSA signatures erroneously rejected in Elliptic",
  "Description": "The Elliptic prior to 6.6.0 for Node.js, in its for ECDSA implementation, does not correctly verify valid signatures if the hash contains at least four leading 0 bytes and when the order of the elliptic curve's base point is smaller than the hash, because of an _truncateToN anomaly. This leads to valid signatures being rejected. Legitimate transactions or communications may be incorrectly flagged as invalid.",
