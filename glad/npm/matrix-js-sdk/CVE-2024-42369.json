  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-42369",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/matrix-js-sdk",
  "Title": "matrix-js-sdk will freeze when a user sets a room with itself as a its predecessor",
  "Description": "A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's `getRoomUpgradeHistory` function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug.",
