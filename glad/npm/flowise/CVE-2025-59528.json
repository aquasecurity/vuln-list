  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59528",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/flowise",
  "Title": "Flowise has Remote Code Execution vulnerability",
  "Description": "The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. \nThis node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it \nexecutes JavaScript code without any security validation.\n\nSpecifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which \nevaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous\nmodules such as child_process and fs.\n",
