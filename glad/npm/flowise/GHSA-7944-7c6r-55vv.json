  "Title": "FlowiseAI Pre-Auth Arbitrary Code Execution",
  "Description": "An authenticated admin user of **FlowiseAI** can exploit the **Supabase RPC Filter** component to execute **arbitrary server-side code** without restriction. By injecting a malicious payload into the filter expression field, the attacker can directly trigger JavaScript's `execSync()` to launch reverse shells, access environment secrets, or perform any OS-level command execution.\n\nThis results in **full server compromise** and severe breach of trust boundaries between frontend input and backend execution logic.",
