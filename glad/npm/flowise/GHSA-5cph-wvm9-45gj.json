  "Title": "Flowise OverrideConfig security vulnerability",
  "Description": "Flowise allows developers to inject configuration into the Chainflow during execution through the `overrideConfig` option. This is supported in both the frontend web integration and the backend Prediction API.\n\nThis has a range of fundamental issues that are a **major** security vulnerability.\nWhile this feature is intentional, it should have strong protections added and be disabled by default.\n\nThese issues include:\n1. Remote code execution. While inside a sandbox this allows for\n1. Sandbox escape\n2. DoS by crashing the server\n3. SSRF\n2. Prompt Injection, both System and User\n1. Full control over LLM prompts\n2. Server variable and data exfiltration\nAnd many many more such as altering the flow of a conversation, prompt exfiltration via LLM proxying etc.\n\nThese issues are self-targeted and do not persist to other users but do leave the server and business exposed.\nAll issues are shown with the API but also work with the web embed.",
