  "Title": "@saltcorn/server arbitrary file and directory listing when accessing build mobile app results",
  "Description": "A user with admin permission can read arbitrary file and directory names on the filesystem by calling the `admin/build-mobile-app/result?build_dir_name=` endpoint.  The `build_dir_name` parameter is not properly validated and it's then used to construct the `buildDir` that is read. The file/directory names under the `buildDir` will be returned.",
