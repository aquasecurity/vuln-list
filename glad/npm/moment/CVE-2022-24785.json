  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-24785",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/moment",
  "Title": "Path Traversal: 'dir/../../filename'",
  "Description": "Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2, and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize the user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js.",
