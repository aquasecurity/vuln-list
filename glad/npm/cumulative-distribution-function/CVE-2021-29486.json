  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29486",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/cumulative-distribution-function",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. Applications using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like `[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"]` for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library).",
