  "PackageSlug": "npm/augustine",
  "Title": "Directory Traversal",
  "Description": "A crafted GET request can be leveraged to traverse the directory structure of a host using the `augustine` web server package, and request arbitrary files outside of the specified web root. This allows for a remote attacker to gain access to arbitrary files on the filesystem that the process has access to read. Mitigating factors: Only files that the user running `augustine`Â has permission to read will be accessible via this vulnerability.",
