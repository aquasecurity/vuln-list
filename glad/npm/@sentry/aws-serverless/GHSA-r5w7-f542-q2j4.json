  "Title": "Potential DoS when using ContextLines integration",
  "Description": "The [ContextLines integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/contextlines/) uses readable streams to more efficiently use memory when reading files. The ContextLines integration is used to attach source context to outgoing events.\n\nThe stream was not explicitly closed after use. This could lead to excessive amounts of file handles open on the system and potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThe ContextLines integration is enabled by default in the Node SDK (`@sentry/node`) and SDKs that run in Node.js environments (`@sentry/astro`, `@sentry/aws-serverless`, `@sentry/bun`, `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless`, `@sentry/nestjs`, `@sentry/nextjs`, `@sentry/nuxt`, `@sentry/remix`, `@sentry/solidstart`, `@sentry/sveltekit`).",
