  "Title": "Sentry SDK Prototype Pollution gadget in JavaScript SDKs",
  "Description": "In case a Prototype Pollution vulnerability is present in a user's application or bundled libraries, the Sentry SDK could potentially serve as a gadget to exploit that vulnerability. The exploitability depends on the specific details of the underlying Prototype Pollution issue.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e This advisory does not indicate the presence of a Prototype Pollution within the Sentry SDK itself. Users are strongly advised to first address any Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in their application, as they pose a more critical security risk.",
