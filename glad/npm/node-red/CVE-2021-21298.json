  "Title": "Path Traversal",
  "Description": "Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built using nodejs. Node-RED has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read` permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The vulnerability applies only to the Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor.",
