  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-22150",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/undici",
  "Title": "Use of Insufficiently Random Values in undici",
  "Description": "[Undici `fetch()` uses Math.random()](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/8b06b8250907d92fead664b3368f1d2aa27c1f35/lib/web/fetch/body.js#L113) to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of Math.random() can be predicted if several of its generated values are known.\n\nIf there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore, An attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met.",
