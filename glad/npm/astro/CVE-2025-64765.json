  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64765",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/astro",
  "Title": "Astro's middleware authentication checks based on url.pathname can be bypassed via url encoded values",
  "Description": "A mismatch exists between how Astro normalizes request paths for routing/rendering and how the application’s middleware reads the path for validation checks. Astro internally applies `decodeURI()` to determine which route to render, while the middleware uses `context.url.pathname` without applying the same normalization (decodeURI).\n\nThis discrepancy may allow attackers to reach protected routes (e.g., /admin) using encoded path variants that pass routing but bypass validation checks.",
