  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66202",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/astro",
  "Title": "Astro has an Authentication Bypass via Double URL Encoding, a bypass for CVE-2025-64765",
  "Description": "A **double URL encoding bypass** allows any unauthenticated attacker to bypass path-based authentication checks in Astro middleware, granting unauthorized access to protected routes. While the original CVE-2025-64765 (single URL encoding) was fixed in v5.15.8, the fix is insufficient as it only decodes once. By using double-encoded URLs like `/%2561dmin` instead of `/%61dmin`, attackers can still bypass authentication and access protected resources such as `/admin`, `/api/internal`, or any route protected by middleware pathname checks.",
