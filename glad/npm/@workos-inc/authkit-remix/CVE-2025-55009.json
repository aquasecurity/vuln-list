  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-55009",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@workos-inc/authkit-remix",
  "Title": "The AuthKit Remix Library renders sensitive auth data in HTML",
  "Description": "Before `0.15.0`, `@workos-inc/authkit-remix` returned sensitive authentication artifacts from the `authkitLoader`, specifically `sealedSession` and `accessToken`. Because these values were returned from the loader, they were embedded into the server-rendered HTML and became readable by any script with access to the pageâ€™s DOM (e.g., in the presence of XSS or a malicious browser extension).\n\n*   **Impact:** Exposure of these secrets can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized API access.\n*   **Fix:** Version `0.15.0` changes the default behavior so the loader no longer returns `sealedSession`/`accessToken`. A secure server-side mechanism is provided to fetch an access token when needed.",
