Here\nis an example of including an image from an invalid path:\n\n```markdown\n![](/tmp/img.png)\n```\n\nWill effectively redownload and include the image\nfound at `/tmp/img.png`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 10.1.3.\nIf impacted, you should update to this version as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisable images downloading, or sanitize paths.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [ZMarkdown](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown/issues).\n",
