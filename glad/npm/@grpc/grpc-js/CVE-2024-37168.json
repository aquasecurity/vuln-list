  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-37168",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@grpc/grpc-js",
  "Title": "@grpc/grpc-js can allocate memory for incoming messages well above configured limits",
  "Description": "There are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option:\n\n1. If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded.\n2. If an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded.",
