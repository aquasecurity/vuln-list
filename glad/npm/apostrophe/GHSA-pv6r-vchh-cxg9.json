  "PackageSlug": "npm/apostrophe",
  "Title": "Denial of Service in apostrophe",
  "Description": "Versions of `apostrophe` prior to 2.97.1 are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The `apostrophe-jobs` module sets a callback for incoming jobs and doesn't clear it regardless of its status. This causes the server to accumulate callbacks, allowing an attacker to start a large number of jobs and exhaust system memory.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.97.1 or later.",
