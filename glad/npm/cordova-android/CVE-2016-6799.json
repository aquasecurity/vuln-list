  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-6799",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/cordova-android",
  "Title": "Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Log Files",
  "Description": "Product: Apache Cordova Android. The application calls methods of the `Log` class. Messages passed to these methods (`Log.v()`, `Log.d()`, `Log.i()`, `Log.w()`, and `Log.e()`) are stored in a series of circular buffers on the device. By default, a maximum of four KB rotated logs are kept in addition to the current log. The logged data can be read using Logcat on the device. When using platforms prior to Android (Jelly Bean), the log data is not sandboxed per application; any application installed on the device has the capability to read data logged by other applications.",
