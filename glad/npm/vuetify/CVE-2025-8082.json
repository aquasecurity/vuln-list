  "PackageSlug": "npm/vuetify",
  "Title": "Vuetify has a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the VDatePicker component",
  "Description": "Improper neutralization of the title date in the 'VDatePicker' component in Vuetify, allows unsanitized HTML to be inserted into the page. This can lead to a  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss  attack.
