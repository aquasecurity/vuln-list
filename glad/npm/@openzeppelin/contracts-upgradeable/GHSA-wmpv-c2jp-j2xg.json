  "PackageSlug": "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable",
  "Title": "ERC1155Supply vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts",
  "Description": "When ERC1155 tokens are minted, a callback is invoked on the receiver of those tokens, as required by the spec. When including the `ERC1155Supply` extension, total supply is not updated until after the callback, thus during the callback the reported total supply is lower than the real number of tokens in circulation.\n\n### Impact\nIf a system relies on accurately reported supply, an attacker may be able to mint tokens and invoke that system after receiving the token balance but before the supply is updated.\n\n### Patches\nA fix is included of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf accurate supply is relevant, do not mint tokens to untrusted receivers.\n\n### Credits\nThe issue was identified and reported by @ChainSecurityAudits.\n\n### For more information\nRead [TotalSupply Inconsistency in ERC1155 NFT Tokens](https://medium.com/chainsecurity/totalsupply-inconsistency-in-erc1155-nft-tokens-8f8e3b29f5aa) by @ChainSecurityAudits for a more detailed breakdown.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@openzeppelin.com.",
