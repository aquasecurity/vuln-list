  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41264",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable",
  "Title": "Improper Initialization",
  "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. In affected versions upgradeable contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` may be vulnerable to an attack affecting uninitialized implementation contracts. A fix is included in version 4.3.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`. For users unable to upgrade; initialize implementation contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` by invoking the initializer function (usually called `initialize`). An example is provided [in the forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301).",
