  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-46320",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts",
  "Title": "Improper Initialization",
  "Description": "In OpenZeppelin \u003c=v4.4.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution.",
