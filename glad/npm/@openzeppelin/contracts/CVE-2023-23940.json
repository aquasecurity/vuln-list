  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-23940",
  "PackageSlug": "npm/@openzeppelin/contracts",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature",
  "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart contract development written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.",
