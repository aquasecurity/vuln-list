  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26293",
  "PackageSlug": "nuget/HtmlSanitizer",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. In HtmlSanitizer, there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `\u003cstyle\u003e` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `\u003cstyle\u003e` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `\u003cstyle\u003e` tag.",
