  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "The png_decompress_chunk function in pngrutil.c in libpng  does not properly handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has a disproportionately large uncompressed representation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption, and application hang) via a crafted PNG file, as demonstrated by use of the deflate compression method on data composed of many occurrences of the same character, related to a \"decompression bomb\" attack.",
