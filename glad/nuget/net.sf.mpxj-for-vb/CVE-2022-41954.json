  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-41954",
  "PackageSlug": "nuget/net.sf.mpxj-for-vb",
  "Title": "Temporary File Information Disclosure vulnerability in MPXJ",
  "Description": "On Unix-like operating systems (not Windows or macos), MPXJ's use of `File.createTempFile(..)` results in temporary files being created with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file. When MPXJ is reading a type of schedule file which requires the creation of a temporary file or directory, a knowledgeable local user could locate these transient files while they are in use and would then be able to read the schedule being processed by MPXJ.",
