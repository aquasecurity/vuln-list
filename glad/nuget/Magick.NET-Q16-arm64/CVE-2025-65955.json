  "Title": "Withdrawn Advisory: ImageMagick has a use-after-free/double-free risk in Options::fontFamily when clearing family",
  "Description": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it does not affect the ImageMagick project's NuGet packages.\n\n### Original Description\nWe believe that we have discovered a potential security vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when `Options::fontFamily` is invoked with an empty string.\n\n**Vulnerability Details**\n- Clearing a font family calls `RelinquishMagickMemory` on `_drawInfo-\u003efont`, freeing the font string but leaving `_drawInfo-\u003efont` pointing to freed memory while `_drawInfo-\u003efamily` is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of `_drawInfo-\u003efont` re-frees or dereferences dangling memory.\n- `DestroyDrawInfo` and other setters (`Options::font`, `Image::font`) assume `_drawInfo-\u003efont` remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.\n\n```cpp\nif (family_.length() == 0)\n  {\n    _drawInfo-\u003efamily=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo-\u003efont);\n    DestroyString(RemoveImageOption(imageInfo(),\"family\"));\n  }\n```\n\n- **CWE-416 (Use After Free):** `_drawInfo-\u003efont` is left dangling yet still reachable through the Options object.\n- **CWE-415 (Double Free):** DrawInfo teardown frees `_drawInfo-\u003efont` again, provoking allocator aborts.\n\n**Affected Versions**\n- Introduced by commit `6409f34d637a34a1c643632aa849371ec8b3b5a8` (“Added fontFamily to the Image class of Magick++”, 2015-08-01, blame line 313).\n- Present in all releases that include that commit, at least ImageMagick 7.0.1-0 and later (likely late 6.9 builds with Magick++ font family support as well). Older releases without `fontFamily` are unaffected.\n\n**Command Line Triggerability**\nThis vulnerability cannot be triggered from the command line interface. The bug is specific to the Magick++ C++ API, specifically the `Options::fontFamily()` method. The command-line utilities (such as `convert`, `magick`, etc.) do not expose this particular code path, as they operate through different internal mechanisms that do not directly call `Options::fontFamily()` with an empty string in a way that would trigger the use-after-free condition.\n\n**Proposed Fix**\n```diff\ndiff --git a/Magick++/lib/Options.cpp b/Magick++/lib/Options.cpp\n@@ void Magick::Options::fontFamily(const std::string \u0026family_)\n-      _drawInfo-\u003efamily=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo-\u003efont);\n+      _drawInfo-\u003efamily=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo-\u003efamily);\n```\nThis frees only the actual family string, leaving `_drawInfo-\u003efont` untouched. Optionally nulling `_drawInfo-\u003efont` when clearing `font()` itself maintains allocator hygiene.",
