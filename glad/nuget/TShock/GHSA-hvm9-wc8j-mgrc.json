  "Title": "TShock Security Escalation Exploit",
  "Description": "An issue with the way OTAPI manages client connections results in stale UUIDs remaining on `RemoteClient` instances after a player disconnects.\n\nBecause of this, if the following conditions are met a player may assume the login state of a previously connected player:\n1. The server has UUID login enabled\n2. An authenticated player disconnects\n3. A subsequent player connects with a modified client that does not send the `ClientUUID#68` packet during connection\n4. The server assigns the same `RemoteClient` object that belonged to the originally authenticated player to the newly connected player",
