  "PackageSlug": "nuget/Magick.NET-Q16-HDRI-x86",
  "Title": "ImageMagick is vulnerable to an integer Overflow in TIM decoder leading to out of bounds read (32-bit only)",
  "Description": "The TIM (PSX TIM) image parser in ImageMagick contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadTIMImage` function (`coders/tim.c`). The code reads `width` and `height` (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates `image_size = 2 * width * height` without checking for overflow.\nOn 32-bit systems (or where `size_t` is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if `width` and `height` are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via `AcquireQuantumMemory` and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read.",
