  "Title": "The Umbraco Heartcore headless client library uses a vulnerable Refit dependency package",
  "Description": "The Heartcore headless client library depends on [Refit ](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) to assist in making HTTP requests to Heartcore public APIs. Refit recently published an advisory regarding a CRLF injection vulnerability whereby it is possible for a malicious user to smuggle additional headers or potentially body content into a request.\n\nThis shouldn't affect Heartcore client library usage as the vulnerable method - `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` - is not used. However, since Refit is a transient dependency for applications using this library, then any users making direct use of Refit could be vulnerable.",
