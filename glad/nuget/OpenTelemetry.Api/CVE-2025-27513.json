Who is impacted?_\n\nA vulnerability in `OpenTelemetry.Api` package `1.10.0` to `1.11.1` could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when a `tracestate` and `traceparent` header is received.\n\n* Even if an application does not explicitly use trace context propagation, receiving these headers can still trigger high CPU usage.\n* This issue impacts any application accessible over the web or backend services that process HTTP requests containing a `tracestate` header.\n* Application may experience excessive resource consumption, leading to increased latency, degraded performance, or downtime.",
