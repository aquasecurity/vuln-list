  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32841",
  "PackageSlug": "nuget/SharpZipLib",
  "Title": "Path traversal in SharpZipLib",
  "Description": "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. A check was added if the destination file is under destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. contains a patch for this vulnerability.",
