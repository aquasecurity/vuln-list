  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32842",
  "PackageSlug": "nuget/SharpZipLib",
  "Title": "Path traversal in SharpZipLib",
  "Description": "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. A check was added if the destination file is under a destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `_baseDirectory` ends with slash. If the `_baseDirectory` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. fixed this vulnerability.",
