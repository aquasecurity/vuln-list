  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-39694",
  "PackageSlug": "nuget/identityserver4",
  "Title": "IdentityServer Open Redirect vulnerability",
  "Description": "It is possible for an attacker to craft malicious Urls that certain functions in IdentityServer will incorrectly treat as local and trusted. If such a Url is returned as a redirect, some browsers will follow it to a third-party, untrusted site.\n\n_Note: by itself, this vulnerability does **not** allow an attacker to obtain user credentials, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, or identity tokens. An attacker could however exploit this vulnerability as part of a phishing attack designed to steal user credentials._",
