{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-20331",
  "PackageSlug": "nuget/mongodb.driver",
  "Title": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
  "Description": "Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver 2.12 \u003c= 2.12.1.",
