  "Description": "# Possible XSS Vulnerability in Action Controller\n\nThere is a possible XSS vulnerability when using the translation helpers\n(`translate`, `t`, etc) in Action Controller. This vulnerability has been\nassigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26143.\n\nVersions Affected:  \u003e= 7.0.0.\nNot affected:       \u003c 7.0.0\nFixed Versions:     7.1.3.1, 7.0.8.1\n\nImpact\n------\nApplications using translation methods like `translate`, or `t` on a\ncontroller, with a key ending in \"_html\", a `:default` key which contains\nuntrusted user input, and the resulting string is used in a view, may be\nsusceptible to an XSS vulnerability.\n\nFor example, impacted code will look something like this:\n\n```ruby\nclass ArticlesController \u003c ApplicationController\n  def show  \n    @message = t(\"message_html\", default: untrusted_input)\n    # The `show` template displays the contents of `@message`\n  end\nend\n```\n\nTo reiterate the pre-conditions, applications must:\n\n* Use a translation function from a controller (i.e. _not_ I18n.t, or `t` from\n  a view)\n* Use a key that ends in `_html`\n* Use a default value where the default value is untrusted and unescaped input\n* Send the text to the victim (whether that's part of a template, or a\n  `render` call)\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for\nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a\nsingle changeset.\n\n*  7-0-translate-xss.patch - Patch for 7.0 series\n*  7-1-translate-xss.patch - Patch for 7.1 series\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to [ooooooo_q](https://hackerone.com/ooooooo_q) for the patch and fix!",
