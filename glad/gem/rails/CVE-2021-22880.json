  "PackageSlug": "gem/rails",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "The PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record suffers from a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability. Carefully crafted input can cause the input validation in the `money` type of the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record to spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This only impacts Rails applications that are using PostgreSQL along with money type columns that take user input.",
