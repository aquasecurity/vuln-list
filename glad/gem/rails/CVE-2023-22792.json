  "Title": "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity",
  "Description": "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch \u003c6.0.6.1,\u003c 6.1.7.1, and \u003c7.0.4.1. Specially crafted cookies, in combination with a specially crafted X_FORWARDED_HOST header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking.
