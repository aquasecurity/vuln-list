  "Title": "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity",
  "Description": "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch \u003c6.1.7.1 and \u003c7.0.4.1 related to the If-None-Match header. A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a version of Ruby below 3.2.0.
