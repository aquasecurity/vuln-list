  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28199",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/phlex",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible with maliciously formed HTML attribute names and values in Phlex",
  "Description": "There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent these attacks.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf you render an `\u003ca\u003e` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user.\n\n```ruby\na(href: user_profile) { \"Profile\" }\n```\n\nIf you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.\n\n```ruby\nh1(**JSON.parse(user_attributes))\n```\n\n### Patches\nPatches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex) for all `1.x` minor versions. The patched versions are:\n\n- [1.9.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.1)\n- [1.8.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.8.2)\n- [1.7.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.7.1)\n- [1.6.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.6.2)\n- [1.5.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.5.2)\n- [1.4.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.4.1)\n- [1.3.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.3.3)\n- [1.2.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.2.2)\n- [1.1.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.1.1)\n- [1.0.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.0.1)\n\nIf you are on `main`, it has been patched since [`aa50c60`](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/aa50c604cdee1d0ce7ef068a4c66cbd5d43f96a1)\n\n### Workarounds\nConfiguring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline) would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.\n\n### References\n\nIn addition to upgrading to a patched version of Phlex, we strongly recommend configuring a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`. Hereâ€™s how you can configure a Content Security Policy header in Rails. https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#content-security-policy-header",
