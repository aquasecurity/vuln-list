{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-7577",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/activerecord",
  "Title": "Nested attributes rejection proc bypass",
  "Description": "When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy: false` option to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. The `allow_destroy` flag prevents the `:reject_if` proc from being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway. However, this is not true if `:allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could set attributes to invalid values or clear all the attributes.",
