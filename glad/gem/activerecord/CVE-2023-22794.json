  "Title": "Duplicate of ./gem/activerecord/CVE-2023-22794.yml",
  "Description": "There is a possible vulnerability in ActiveRecord related to the sanitization of comments. Previously the implementation of escaping for comments was insufficient. If malicious user input is passed to either the annotate query method, the optimizer_hints query method, or through the QueryLogs interface which automatically adds annotations, it may be sent to the database with insufficient sanitization and be able to inject SQL outside of the comment. In most cases these interfaces wonâ€™t be used with user input and users should avoid doing so.",
