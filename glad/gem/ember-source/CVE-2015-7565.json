  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-7565",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/ember-source",
  "Title": "XSS Vulnerability with User-Supplied JSON",
  "Description": "By default, Ember will escape any values in Handlebars templates that use double curlies (`{{value}}`). Developers can specifically opt out of this escaping behavior by passing an instance of `SafeString` rather than a raw string, which tells Ember that it should not escape the string because the developer has taken responsibility for escapement. It is possible for an attacker to create a specially-crafted payload that causes a non-sanitized string to be treated as a `SafeString`, and thus bypass Ember's normal escaping behavior. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\").",
