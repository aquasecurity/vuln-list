  "Identifier": "CVE-2014-0013",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/ember-source",
  "Title": "Potential XSS Exploit With User-Supplied Data When Binding",
  "Description": "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, we have identified a vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted into the innerHTML string without being sanitized. When a primitive value is used as the Handlebars context, that value is not properly escaped. An example of this would be using the `{{each}}` helper to iterate over an array of user-supplied strings and using `{{this}}` inside the block to display each string. In applications that contain templates whose context is a primitive value and use the `{{this}}` keyword to display that value, a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\"). This vulnerability affects applications that contain templates whose context is set to a user-supplied primitive value (such as a string or number) and also contain the `{{this}}` special Handlebars variable to display the value.",
