  "Identifier": "CVE-2014-0046",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/ember-source",
  "Title": "XSS Vulnerability With {{link-to}} Helper in Non-block Form",
  "Description": "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before inserting it in strings that will be sent to `innerHTML`. However, a change made to the implementation of the `{{link-to}}` helper means that any user-supplied data bound to the `{{link-to}}` helper's title attribute will not be escaped correctly. In applications that use the `{{link-to}}` helper in non-block form and bind the title attribute to user-supplied content, a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\").
