  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-48069",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/ejson2env",
  "Title": "Insufficient input sanitization in ejson2env ",
  "Description": "The `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.",
