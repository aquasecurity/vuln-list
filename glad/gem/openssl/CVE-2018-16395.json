{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-16395",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/openssl",
  "Title": "Improper Certificate Validation",
  "Description": "When two `OpenSSL::X509::Name` objects are compared using `==`, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of `==` will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.",
