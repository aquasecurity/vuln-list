  "Title": "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in plain_text_for_blockquote_node in Action Text",
  "Description": "There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper in Action Text. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-47888.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nCarefully crafted text can cause the plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.\n\nRuby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.\n\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nUsers can avoid calling `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` or upgrade to Ruby 3.2\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to [ooooooo_q](https://hackerone.com/ooooooo_q) for the report!",
