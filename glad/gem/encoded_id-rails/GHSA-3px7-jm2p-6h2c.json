  "Title": "encoded_id-rails potential DOS vulnerability due to URIs with extremely long encoded IDs",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe length of URIs and the various parts (eg path segments, query parameters) is usually limited by the webserver processing the incoming request. In the case of Puma the defaults are :\n\n- path segment length: 8192\n- Max URI length: 1024 * 12\n- Max query length: 1024 * 10\n\nSee https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/compile_options.md\n\nIf too long Puma raises:\n\u003e Puma caught this error: HTTP element REQUEST_PATH is longer than the (8192) allowed length (was 12503) (Puma::HttpParserError)\n\nHowever due to the performance of `hashids` extremely long encoded IDs will consume a large amount of CPU and allocate a huge number of intermediate objects.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncurl -vvv https://localhost.ssl:3000//dos?id=abcd-\u003c'a' * 10077\u003e\n```\n\nThis causes the application to spend a huge amount of time decoding the ID and the allocation of \u003e 200MB of objects.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to `1.0.0.beta2`\n\nThis introduces a new option to limit the length of IDs that can be decoded. A future release will also improve the performance and hugely reduce allocations in the underlying hashids implementation.",
