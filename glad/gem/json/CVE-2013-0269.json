{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2013-0269",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/json",
  "Title": "Denial of Service and Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability",
  "Description": "When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to creating Ruby symbols in a target system. Since Ruby symbols are not garbage collected, this can result in a denial of service attack. The same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects. These \"act alike\" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.",
