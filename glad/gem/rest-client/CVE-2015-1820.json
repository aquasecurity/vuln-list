  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-1820",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rest-client",
  "Title": "Session fixation vulnerability via Set-Cookie headers",
  "Description": "The package rest-client in `abstract_response.rb` improperly handles `Set-Cookie` headers on HTTP redirection responses. Any cookies will be forwarded to the redirection target regardless of domain, path, or expiration. If you control a redirection source, you can cause rest-client to perform a request to any third-party domain with cookies of your choosing, which may be useful in performing a session fixation attack. If you control a redirection target, you can steal any cookies set by the third-party redirection request.",
