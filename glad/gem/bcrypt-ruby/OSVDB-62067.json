  "Title": "Bug reduced the entropy of hashed passwords containing non US-ASCII characters",
  "Description": "This package suffered from a bug related to character encoding that substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords containing non US-ASCII characters. An incorrect encoding step transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to hashing. In the worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII characters, this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other such passwords of the same length. This issue only affects the JRuby implementation.",
