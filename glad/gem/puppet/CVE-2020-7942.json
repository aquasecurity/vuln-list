{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-7942",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/puppet",
  "Title": "Improper Certificate Validation",
  "Description": "Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true.",
