  "PackageSlug": "gem/spree_auth_devise",
  "Title": "Spree Auth Devise vulnerability allows for authentication bypass through CSRF weakness",
  "Description": "CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.\n\nAll applications using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise` are affected if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:\n\n* Executed whether as:\n* A before_action callback (the default)\n* A prepend_before_action (option prepend: true given) before the :load_object hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find).\n* Configured to use :null_session or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception).\n\nThat means that applications that haven't been configured differently from what it's generated with Rails aren't affected.\n\nThanks @waiting-for-dev for reporting and providing a patch üëè",
