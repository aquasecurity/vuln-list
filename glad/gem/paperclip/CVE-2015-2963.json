  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-2963",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/paperclip",
  "Title": "Content type spoofing vulnerability",
  "Description": "There is an issue where if an HTML file is uploaded with a `.html` extension, but the content type is listed as being `image/jpeg`, this will bypass a validation checking for images. But it will also pass the spoof check, because a file named `.html` and containing actual HTML passes the spoof check.",
