{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26222",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/dependabot-core",
  "Title": "Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "Dependabot is a set of packages for automated dependency management for Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Elixir, Rust, Java, .NET, Elm and Go. In Dependabot-Core from beta1, there is a remote code execution vulnerability in dependabot-common and dependabot-go_modules when a source branch name contains malicious injectable bash code. For example, if Dependabot is configured to use the following source branch name: `/$({curl,127.0.0.1})`, Dependabot will make a HTTP request to the following URL: `127.0.0.1` when cloning the source repository. As a workaround, one can escape the branch name prior to passing it to the `Dependabot::Source` class.",
