  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45409",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/ruby-saml",
  "Title": "SAML authentication bypass via Incorrect XPath selector",
  "Description": "Ruby-SAML in \u003c= 12.2 and 1.13.0 \u003c= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system.\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by ahacker1 of SecureSAML (ahacker1@securesaml.com)",
