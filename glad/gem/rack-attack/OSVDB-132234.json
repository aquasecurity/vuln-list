  "Title": "Missing normalization before request path processing",
  "Description": "When using rack-attack with a RoR app, developers expect the request path to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so a request path `/login/` becomes `/login` by the time you're in `ActionController`. Since `Rack::Attack` runs before `ActionDispatch`, the request path is not yet normalized. This can cause throttles and denylists to not work as expected.",
