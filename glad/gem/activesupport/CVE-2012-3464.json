  "Identifier": "CVE-2012-3464",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/activesupport",
  "Title": "Potential XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails",
  "Description": "The HTML escaping code in Ruby on Rails does not escape all potentially dangerous characters. In particular the code does not escape the single quote character. The helpers used in Rails itself never use single quotes, so most applications are unlikely to be vulnerable, however all users running an affected release should still upgrade.",
