  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-3226",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/activesupport",
  "Title": "XSS Vulnerability in ActiveSupport::JSON.encode",
  "Description": "When a `Hash` containing user-controlled data is encoded as JSON (either through `Hash#to_json` or `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode`), Rails does not perform adequate escaping that matches the guarantee implied by the `escape_html_entities_in_json` option (which is enabled by default). If this resulting JSON string is subsequently inserted directly into an HTML page, the page will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.",
