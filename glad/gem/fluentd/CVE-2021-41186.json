{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41186",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/fluentd",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The `parser_apache2` plugin in Fluentd suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. There are two workarounds available. Either don't use `parser_apache2` for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of `parser_apache2.rb` into `/etc/fluent/plugin` directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).",
