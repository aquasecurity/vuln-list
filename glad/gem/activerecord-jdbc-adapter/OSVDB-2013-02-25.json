  "Title": "SQL Injection",
  "Description": "ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter (AR-JDBC) contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the `sql.gsub()` function in `lib/arjdbc/jdbc/adapter.rb` not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This may allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.",
