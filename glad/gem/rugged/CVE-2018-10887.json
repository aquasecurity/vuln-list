  "PackageSlug": "gem/rugged",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in libgit2 which is wrapped by the rugged gem. It has been discovered that an unexpected sign extension in `git_delta_apply` function in `delta.c` file may lead to an integer overflow which in turn leads to an out-of-bound read, which allows reading before the base object. An attacker may use this flaw to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service.",
