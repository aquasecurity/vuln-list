  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-27281",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rdoc",
  "Title": "RDoc RCE vulnerability with .rdoc_options",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in RDoc 6.3.3 through 6.6.2, as distributed in Ruby 3.x through 3.3.0.\n\nWhen parsing `.rdoc_options` (used for configuration in RDoc) as a YAML file, object injection and resultant remote code execution are possible because there are no restrictions on the classes that can be restored.\n\nWhen loading the documentation cache, object injection and resultant remote code execution are also possible if there were a crafted cache.\n\nWe recommend to update the RDoc gem to version 6.6.3.1 or later. In order to ensure compatibility with bundled version in older Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:\n\n* For Ruby 3.0 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.3.4.1\n* For Ruby 3.1 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.4.1.1\n* For Ruby 3.2 users: Update to `rdoc` 6.5.1.1\n\nYou can use `gem update rdoc` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem \"rdoc\", \"\u003e= 6.6.3.1\"` to your `Gemfile`.\n\nNote: 6.3.4, 6.4.1, 6.5.1 and 6.6.3 have a incorrect fix. We recommend to upgrade 6.3.4.1, 6.4.1.1, 6.5.1.1 and 6.6.3.1 instead of them.",
