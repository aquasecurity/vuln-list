  "Identifier": "CVE-2012-6708",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rdoc",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "The jQuery library, which is included in rdoc, is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the `\u003c` character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.",
