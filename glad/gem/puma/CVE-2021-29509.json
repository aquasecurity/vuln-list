  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29509",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/puma",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Puma is a concurrent HTTP server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections.",
