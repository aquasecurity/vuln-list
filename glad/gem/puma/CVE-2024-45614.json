  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45614",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/puma",
  "Title": "Puma's header normalization allows for client to clobber proxy set headers",
  "Description": "Clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users trusting headers set by their proxy may be affected. Attackers may be able to downgrade connections to HTTP (non-SSL) or redirect responses, which could cause confidentiality leaks if combined with a separate MITM attack.",
