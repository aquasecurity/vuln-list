  "PackageSlug": "gem/activerecord-session_store",
  "Title": "Observable Timing Discrepancy",
  "Description": "The activerecord-session_store (aka Active Record Session Store) component for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering information about whether a guessed session ID is valid.
