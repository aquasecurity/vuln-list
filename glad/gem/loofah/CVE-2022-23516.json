  "Description": "## Summary\n\nLoofah `\u003e= 2.2.0, \u003c 2.19.1` uses recursion for sanitizing `CDATA` sections, making it susceptible to stack exhaustion and raising a `SystemStackError` exception. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.\n\n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Loofah `\u003e= 2.19.1`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade may be able to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the length of the strings that are sanitized.\n\n\n## Severity\n\nThe Loofah maintainers have evaluated this as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE - CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion (4.9)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/674.html)\n",
