  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-8796",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/devise-two-factor",
  "Title": "Devise-Two-Factor Authentication Uses Insufficient Default OTP Shared Secret Length",
  "Description": "Under the default configuration, Devise-Two-Factor versions 1.0.0 or \u003e= 4.0.0 \u0026 \u003c 6.0.0 generate TOTP shared secrets that are 120 bits instead of the 128-bit minimum defined by [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226). Using a shared secret shorter than the minimum to generate a multi-factor authentication code could make it easier for an attacker to guess the shared secret and generate valid TOTP codes.",
