  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15169",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/actionview",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "In Action View there is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Action View's translation helpers. Views that allow the user to control the default (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be susceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing translation key named html or ending in `_html`, the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped.",
