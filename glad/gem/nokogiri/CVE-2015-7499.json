  "PackageSlug": "gem/nokogiri",
  "Title": "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in libxml2",
  "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in `parser.c` in libxml2 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive process memory information via unspecified vectors. It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled certain malformed documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause libxml2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
