  "Description": "The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains several vulnerabilities. Nokogiri has mitigated these issues by upgrading to libxml It was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-0663) It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity references. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that could expose sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375) It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in libxml2 when handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

An attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047) Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread in libxml2 when handling elements. An attacker could use this to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9048) Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads in libxml2 when handling parameter-entity references. An attacker could use these to specially construct XML data that could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)",
