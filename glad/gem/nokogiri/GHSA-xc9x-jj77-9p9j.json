  "Title": "Nokogiri update packaged libxml2 to v2.12.5 to resolve CVE-2024-25062",
  "Description": "## Summary\n\nNokogiri v1.16.2 upgrades the version of its dependency libxml2 to [v2.12.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.5).\n\nlibxml2 v2.12.5 addresses the following vulnerability:\n\n- CVE-2024-25062 / https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25062\n - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/604\n - patched by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/92721970\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `\u003c 1.16.2`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `\u003e= 1.16.2`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `\u003e= 2.12.5` which will also address these same issues.\n\n## Impact\n\nFrom the CVE description, this issue applies to the `xmlTextReader` module (which underlies `Nokogiri::XML::Reader`):\n\n\u003e When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-02-04 10:35 EST - this GHSA is drafted without complete details about when the upstream issue was introduced; a request is made of libxml2 maintainers for more detailed information\n- 2024-02-04 10:48 EST - updated GHSA to reflect libxml2 maintainers' confirmation of affected versions\n- 2024-02-04 11:54 EST - v1.16.2 published, this GHSA made public\n- 2024-02-05 10:18 EST - updated with MITRE link to the CVE information, and updated \"Impact\" section",
