  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-5257",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/administrate",
  "Title": "SQL Injection",
  "Description": "In Administrate (rubygem), when sorting by attributes on a dashboard, the direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated into the SQL query. This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication.",
