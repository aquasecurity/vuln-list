{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15134",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/faye",
  "Title": "Improper Certificate Validation",
  "Description": "In faye-websocket, there is a lack of certification validation in TLS handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in `EventMachine` to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made using this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.",
