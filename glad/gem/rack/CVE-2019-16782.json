  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16782",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rack",
  "Title": "Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack",
  "Description": "There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session.\n\nThe session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.",
