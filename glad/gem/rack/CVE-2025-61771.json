  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-61771",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rack",
  "Title": "Rack: Multipart parser buffers large non‑file fields entirely in memory, enabling DoS (memory exhaustion)",
  "Description": "`Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single large text field in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS).",
