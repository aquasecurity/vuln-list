  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-61919",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rack",
  "Title": "Rack is vulnerable to a memory-exhaustion DoS through unbounded URL-encoded body parsing",
  "Description": "`Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into memory for `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing a length or cap. Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion.",
