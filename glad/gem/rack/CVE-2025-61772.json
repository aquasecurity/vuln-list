  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-61772",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/rack",
  "Title": "Rack's multipart parser buffers unbounded per-part headers, enabling DoS (memory exhaustion)",
  "Description": "`Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a multipart part’s header block never terminates with the required blank line (`CRLFCRLF`). The parser keeps appending incoming bytes to memory without a size cap, allowing a remote attacker to exhaust memory and cause a denial of service (DoS).",
