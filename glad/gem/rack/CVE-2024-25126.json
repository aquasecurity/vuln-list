  "PackageSlug": "gem/rack",
  "Title": "Rack vulnerable to ReDoS in content type parsing (2nd degree polynomial)",
  "Description": "### Summary\n\n```ruby\nmodule Rack\n  class MediaType\n    SPLIT_PATTERN = %r{\\s*[;,]\\s*}\n```\n\nThe above regexp is subject to ReDos. 50K blank characters as a prefix to the header will take over 10s to split.\n\n### PoC\n\nA simple HTTP request with lots of blank characters in the content-type header:\n\n```ruby\nrequest[\"Content-Type\"] = (\" \" * 50_000) + \"a,\"\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nIt's a very easy to craft ReDoS. Like all ReDoS the impact is debatable.",
