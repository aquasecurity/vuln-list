  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-56733",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/pwpush",
  "Title": "Password Pusher Allows Session Token Interception Leading to Potential Hijacking",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been reported in Password Pusher where an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing session hijacking.\n\nAlthough the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the user's session until the token expires or is manually cleared.\n\nThis vulnerability hinges on the attacker's ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like XSS, or via direct access to the victim's device.",
