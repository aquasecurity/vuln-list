  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-52796",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/pwpush",
  "Title": "Password Pusher rate limiter can be bypassed by forging proxy headers",
  "Description": "Password Pusher comes with a configurable rate limiter.  In versions prior to [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0), the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service.\n\nAdditionally, with the ability to bypass rate limiting, it also allows attackers to more easily execute brute force attacks.",
