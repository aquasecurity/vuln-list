  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-25613",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/webrick",
  "Title": "WEBRick vulnerable to HTTP Request/Response Smuggling",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check), which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.",
