  "Title": "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack",
  "Description": "This is a duplicate of /gem/actionpack/CVE-2023-22797.yml. There is a vulnerability in Action Controllerâ€™s `redirect_to`. There is a possible open redirect when using the redirect_to helper with untrusted user input. Vulnerable code will look like this: `redirect_to(params[:some_param])`. Rails 7.0 introduced protection against open redirects from calling `redirect_to` with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check introduced could be bypassed by a carefully crafted URL.",
