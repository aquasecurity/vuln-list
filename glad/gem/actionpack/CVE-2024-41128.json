  "Title": "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in query parameter filtering in Action Dispatch",
  "Description": "There is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-41128.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nCarefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or apply the relevant patch immediately.\n\nRuby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.\n\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nUsers on Ruby 3.2 are unaffected by this issue.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to [scyoon](https://hackerone.com/scyoon) for the report and patches!",
