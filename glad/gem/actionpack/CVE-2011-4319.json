  "Identifier": "CVE-2011-4319",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/actionpack",
  "Title": "Translate helper method which may allow an attacker to insert arbitrary code into a page",
  "Description": "The helper method for i18n translations has a convention whereby translations strings with a name ending in 'html' are considered HTML safe. There is also a mechanism for interpolation. It has been discovered that these 'html' strings allow arbitrary values to be contained in the interpolated input, and these values are not escaped.",
