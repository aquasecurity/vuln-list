  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-2097",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/actionpack",
  "Title": "Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in ActionView",
  "Description": "Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability. Impacted code will look something like this: `def index; render params[:id]; end`. Carefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.",
