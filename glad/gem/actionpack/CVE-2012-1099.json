  "Identifier": "CVE-2012-1099",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/actionpack",
  "Title": "XSS via posted select tag options",
  "Description": "Ruby on Rails is vulnerable to remote cross-site scripting because the application does not validate manually generated `select tag options` upon submission to `actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/form_options_helper.rb`. This may allow a user to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server. ",
