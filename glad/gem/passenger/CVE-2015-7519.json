  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-7519",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/passenger",
  "Title": "Header overwriting",
  "Description": "It is possible in some cases, for clients to overwrite headers set by the server, resulting in a medium level security issue. Passenger 5 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass headers to Ruby/Python applications, while Passenger 4 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass headers to all applications. This implies a conversion to UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES whereby the difference between characters like '-' and '_' is lost. See \"Affected use-cases\" in provided link to establish wether one particular application is affected.",
