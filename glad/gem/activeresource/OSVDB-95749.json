  "Identifier": "OSVDB-95749",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/activeresource",
  "Title": "Remote code execution and potential Denial of Service Vulnerability",
  "Description": "Activeresource contains a format string flaw in the request function of `lib/active_resource/connection.rb`. The issue is triggered as format string specifiers (e.g. `%s` and `%x`) are not properly sanitized in user-supplied input when passed via the `result.code` and `result.message` variables. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
