  "Title": "nistec has Incorrect Calculation in Multiplication of unreduced P-256 scalars",
  "Description": "Multiplication of certain unreduced P-256 scalars produce incorrect results.\n\nThere are no protocols known at this time that can be attacked due to this.\n\nFrom the fix commit notes:\n\nUnlike the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly does not use complete\naddition formulas, meaning that p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the\ncorrect value if the two inputs are equal.\n\nThis was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops\nbecause as long as the input point is not the identity and the scalar is\nlower than the order of the group, the addition inputs can't be the same.\n\nAs part of the math/big rewrite, we went however from always reducing\nthe scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption\nthat the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction.",
