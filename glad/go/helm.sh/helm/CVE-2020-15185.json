{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15185",
  "PackageSlug": "go/helm.sh/helm",
  "Title": "Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier",
  "Description": "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm repository can contain duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is to manually review the index file in the Helm repository cache before installing software.",
