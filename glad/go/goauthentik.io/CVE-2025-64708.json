  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64708",
  "PackageSlug": "go/goauthentik.io",
  "Title": "authentik's invitation expiry is delayed by at least 5 minutes",
  "Description": "In previous authentik versions, invitations were considered valid regardless if they are expired or not, thus relying on background tasks to clean up expired ones. In a normal scenario this can take up to 5 minutes because the cleanup of expired objects is scheduled to run every 5 minutes. However, with a large amount of tasks in the backlog, this might take longer.",
