  "Title": "listmonk's Sprig template Injection vulnerability leads to reading of Environment Variable for low privilege user",
  "Description": "The `env` and `expandenv` template functions which is enabled by default in [Sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) enables capturing of env variables on host. While this may not be a problem on single-user (super admin) installations, on multi-user installations, this allows non-super-admin users with campaign or template permissions to use the `{{ env }}` template expression to capture sensitive environment variables.\n\n**Upgrade to [v5.0.2](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/releases/tag/v5.0.2)** to mitigate.\n\n---------",
