  "Title": "Path Traversal",
  "Description": "bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd there is a zipslip vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file.",
