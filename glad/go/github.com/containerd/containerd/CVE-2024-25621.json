  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-25621",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/containerd/containerd",
  "Title": "containerd affected by a local privilege escalation via wide permissions on CRI directory",
  "Description": "An overly broad default permission vulnerability was found in containerd.\n\n- `/var/lib/containerd` was created with the permission bits 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n- Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the metadata store and the content store\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri` was created with 0o755, while it should be created with 0o700\n- Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the contents of Kubernetes local volumes. The contents of volumes might include setuid binaries, which could allow a local user on the host to elevate privileges on the host.\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim` was created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n\nThe directory paths may differ depending on the daemon configuration.\nWhen the `temp` directory path is specified in the daemon configuration, that directory was also created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700.",
