  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-43816",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/containerd/containerd",
  "Title": "Improper Preservation of Permissions",
  "Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. On installations using SELinux, such as EL8 (CentOS, RHEL), Fedora, or SUSE MicroOS, with containerd as the backing container runtime interface (CRI), an unprivileged pod scheduled to the node may bind mount, via `hostPath` volume, any privileged, regular file on disk for complete read/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing the in-container location of the `hostPath` volume mount at either `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations are being relabeled indiscriminately to match the container process-label which effectively elevates permissions for savvy containers that would not normally be able to access privileged host files. This issue has been resolved Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.",
