  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-25153",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/containerd/containerd",
  "Title": "OCI image importer memory exhaustion in github.com/containerd/containerd",
  "Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.",
