  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45310",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/opencontainers/runc",
  "Title": "runc can be confused to create empty files/directories on the host",
  "Description": "runc 1.1.13 and earlier as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier can be tricked into\ncreating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host\nfilesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race\nwith os.MkdirAll. While this can be used to create empty files, existing\nfiles **will not** be truncated.\n\nAn attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom\nvolume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but\nthe scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced.\nSufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block\nthis attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict\nthis attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed.\n\nThis is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and\nKubernetes.\n\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N (Low severity, 3.6).",
