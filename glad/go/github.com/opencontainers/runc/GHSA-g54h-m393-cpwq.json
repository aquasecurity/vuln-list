  "Title": "Devices resource list treated as a denylist by default",
  "Description": "Contrary to the OCI runtime specification `runc`'s implementation of the `linux.resources.devices` list was a black-list by default. This means that users who created their own `config.json` objects and didn't prefix a deny-all rule (`{\"allow\": false, \"permissions\": \"rwm\"}` or equivalent) were not provided protection by the `devices` cgroup.",
