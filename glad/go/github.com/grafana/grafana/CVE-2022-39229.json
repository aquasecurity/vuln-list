  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-39229",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/grafana/grafana",
  "Title": "Grafana when using email as a username can block other users from signing in",
  "Description": "On September 7 as a result of an internal security audit we have discovered a security vulnerability in Grafana basic authentication, related to the usage of username and email address.\n\nIn Grafana, a user’s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user.\n\nIn addition, a user can have an email address as a username and Grafana login allows users to sign in with either username or email address. This creates an unusual behavior, where _user_1_ can register with one email address and _user_2_ can register their username as _user_1_’s email address. As a result, _user_1_ would be prevented to sign in Grafana, since _user_1_ password won’t match with _users_2_ email address.\n\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).",
