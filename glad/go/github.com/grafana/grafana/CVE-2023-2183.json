  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-2183",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/grafana/grafana",
  "Title": "Missing Authorization",
  "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nThe option to send a test alert is not available from the user panel UI for users having the Viewer role. It is still possible for a user with the Viewer role to send a test alert using the API as the API does not check access to this function.\n\nThis might enable malicious users to abuse the functionality by sending multiple alert messages to e-mail and Slack, spamming users, prepare Phishing attack or block SMTP server.\n\nUsers may upgrade to version 9.5.3, 9.4.12, 9.3.15, 9.2.19 and 8.5.26 to receive a fix.\n\n",
