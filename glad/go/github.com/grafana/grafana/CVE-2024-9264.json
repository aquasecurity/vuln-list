  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-9264",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/grafana/grafana",
  "Title": "Grafana Command Injection And Local File Inclusion Via Sql Expressions",
  "Description": "The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.",
