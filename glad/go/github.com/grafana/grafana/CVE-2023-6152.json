  "Title": "Email Validation Bypass And Preventing Sign Up From Email's Owner",
  "Description": "Email validation can easily be bypassed because `verify_email_enabled` option enable email validation at sign up only.\nA user changing it's email after signing up (and verifying it) can change it without verification in `/profile`.\nThis can be used to prevent legitimate owner of the email address from signing up.\n\nAnother way to prevent email's owner from signing up is by setting Username as an email:\nWhen a new user is registrering, they can set two different email addresses in the Email and Username field, technically having 2 email addresses (because Grafana handles usernames and emails the same in some situations), but only the former is validated.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44581623/282073913-c1a8c20b-b6c3-46eb-840c-9e0dae718a2a.png)\n\nHere user a prevents owner of bar@example.com to signup.",
