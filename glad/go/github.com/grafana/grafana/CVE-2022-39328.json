  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/grafana/grafana",
  "Title": "Grafana Race condition allowing privilege escalation",
  "Description": "Internal security audit identified a race condition in the Grafana codebase, which allowed an unauthenticated user to query an arbitrary endpoint in Grafana.\nA race condition in the [HTTP context creation](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/pkg/web/router.go#L153) could make a HTTP request being assigned the authentication/authorization middlewares of another call. Under heavy load it is possible that a call protected by a privileged middleware receives instead the middleware of a public query.\nAs a result, an unauthenticated user can successfully query protected endpoints.",
