  "Title": "Denial of service via insufficient metadata validation",
  "Description": "The PAM module for `fscrypt` through v0.3.2 does not adequately validate `fscrypt` metadata files, allowing users to create malicious metadata files that prevent other users from logging in. A local user can cause a denial of service by creating a `fscrypt` metadata file that prevents other users from logging into the system. We recommend upgrading to v0.3.3 or above.\n\nFor more details, see [CVE-2022-25327](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25327).",
