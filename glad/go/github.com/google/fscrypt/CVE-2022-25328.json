  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-25328",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/google/fscrypt",
  "Title": "Command injection in github.com/google/fscrypt",
  "Description": "The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above",
