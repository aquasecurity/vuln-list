  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-0317",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/google/go-attestation",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "An improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation before 0.3.3 allows local users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs, causing AKPublic.Verify to succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot. We recommend upgrading to Version 0.4.0 or above.",
