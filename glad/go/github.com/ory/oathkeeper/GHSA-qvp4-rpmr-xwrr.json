  "Title": "Possible bypass of token claim validation when OAuth2 Introspection caching is enabled",
  "Description": "When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`.",
