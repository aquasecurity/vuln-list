  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-22149",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/MicahParks/jwkset",
  "Title": "JWK Set's HTTP client only overwrites and appends JWK to local cache during refresh",
  "Description": "The project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation.\n\nExample attack scenario:\n1. An attacker has stolen the private key for a key published in JWK Set.\n2. The publishers of that JWK Set remove that key from the JWK Set.\n3. Enough time has passed that the program using the auto-caching HTTP client found in `github.com/MicahParks/jwkset` v0.5.0-v0.5.21 has elapsed its `HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval` duration, causing a refresh of the remote JWK Set.\n4. The attacker is signing content (such as JWTs) with the stolen private key and the system has no other forms of revocation.",
