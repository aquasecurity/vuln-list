  "Title": "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation",
  "Description": "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In Istio The authorization policy with hosts and notHosts might be accidentally bypassed for ALLOW action or rejected unexpectedly for DENY action during the upgrade from to /1.12.1. Istio supports the hosts and notHosts fields in authorization policy with a new Envoy API shipped with the data plane. A bug in the incorrectly uses the new Envoy API with the data plane.

Users are advised to upgrade or to not mix the /1.12.1 control plane with data plane if using hosts or notHosts field in authorization policy.",
