  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-11767",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/istio/istio",
  "Title": "Information Exposure",
  "Description": "Istio has a data-leak issue. If there is a TCP connection (negotiated with SNI over HTTPS) to `*.example.com`, a request for a domain concurrently configured explicitly (e.g., `abc.example.com`) is sent to the server(s) listening behind `*.example.com`. The outcome should instead be Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users.",
