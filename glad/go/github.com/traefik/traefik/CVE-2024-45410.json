  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/traefik/traefik",
  "Title": "HTTP client can manipulate custom HTTP headers that are added by Traefik",
  "Description": "When a HTTP request is processed by Traefik, certain HTTP headers such as X-Forwarded-Host or X-Forwarded-Port are added by Traefik before the request is routed to the application. For a HTTP client, it should not be possible to remove or modify these headers. Since the application trusts the value of these headers, security implications might arise, if they can be modified.\n\nFor HTTP/1.1, however, it was found that some of theses custom headers can indeed be removed and in certain cases manipulated. The attack relies on the HTTP/1.1 behavior, that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. By setting the following connection header, the X-Forwarded-Host header can, for example, be removed:\n\nConnection: close, X-Forwarded-Host\n\nDepending on how the receiving application handles such cases, security implications may arise. Moreover, some application frameworks (e.g. Django) first transform the \"-\" to \"_\" signs, making it possible for the HTTP client to even modify these headers in these cases.\n\nThis is similar to [CVE-2022-31813](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31813) for Apache HTTP Server.",
