  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54386",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/traefik/traefik",
  "Title": "Traefik Client Plugin's Path Traversal Vulnerability Allows Arbitrary File Overwrite and Remote Code Execution",
  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in WASM Traefik’s plugin installation mechanism. By supplying a maliciously crafted ZIP archive containing file paths with `../` sequences, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system outside of the intended plugin directory. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE), privilege escalation, persistence, or denial of service.\n**✅ After investigation, it is confirmed that no plugins on the [Catalog](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins) were affected. There is no known impact.**",
