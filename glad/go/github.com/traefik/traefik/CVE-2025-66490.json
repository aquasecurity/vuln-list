  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/traefik/traefik",
  "Title": "Path Normalization Bypass in Traefik Router + Middleware Rules",
  "Description": "There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a `PathPrefix`, `Path` or `PathRegex` matcher.\n\nWhen Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path; if the request path contains an encoded restricted character from the following set **('/', '\\', 'Null', ';', '?', '#')**, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain.\n\nAccess Control Bypass:\nAny endpoint intended to be blocked (e.g., admin/debug/beta APIs) can be accessed by URL-encoding slashes or other characters.\n\nThis could lead to:\n\n- Unauthorized access to restricted endpoints\n- Execution of protected internal functionality\n- Potential privilege escalation\n- Bypass of security policies enforced via Traefik routing rules\n\u003c/details\u003e",
