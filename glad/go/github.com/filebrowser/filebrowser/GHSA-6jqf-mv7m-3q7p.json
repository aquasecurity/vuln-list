  "Title": "File Browser has risk of HTTP Request/Response smuggling through vulnerable dependency",
  "Description": "The standard library `net/http` package dependency used by File Browser improperly accepts a bare LF as a line terminator in chunked data chunk-size lines. I can permit request smuggling if a net/http server is used in conjunction with a server that incorrectly accepts a bare LF as part of a chunk-ext.\n\nSee https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22871 for more details.",
