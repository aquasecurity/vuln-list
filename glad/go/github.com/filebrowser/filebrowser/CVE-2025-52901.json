  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser",
  "Title": "File Browser allows sensitive data to be transferred in URL",
  "Description": "URLs that are accessed by a user are commonly logged in many locations, both server- and client-side. It is thus good practice to never transmit any secret information as part of a URL. The *Filebrowser* violates this practice, since access tokens are used as GET parameters.",
