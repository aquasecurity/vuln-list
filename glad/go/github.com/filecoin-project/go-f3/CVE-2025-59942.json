A \"poison\" message can can cause integer overflow in the signer index validation.  In Lotus' case, the whole node will crash.\n\nThere is no barrier to entry.  An attacker doesn't need any power to pull off this attack.\n\nThese malicious messages aren't self-propagating since the bug is in the validator.
