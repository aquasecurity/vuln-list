  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-24767",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService",
  "Title": "CasaOS Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability",
  "Description": "### Summary\nHere it is observed that the CasaOS doesn't defend against password brute force attacks, which leads to having full access to the server.\n\n### Details\nThe web application lacks control over the login attempts i.e. why attacker can use a password brute force attack to find and get full access over the.\n\n### PoC\n1. Capture login request in proxy tool like Burp Suite and select password field.\n\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297156515-0272bfd7-f386-4c22-b3bd-c4dbdc1298bf.PNG)\n\n2. Here I have started attack with total number of 271 password tries where the last one is the correct password and as we can see in the following image we get a **400 Bad Request** status code with the message \"**Invalid Password**\" and response length **769** on 1st request which was sent at **_Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:31:32 GMT_**\n\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297157815-c158995b-7d46-4a5a-aef9-bcbbcf596b15.png)\n\n**Note**:  _We have tested this vulnerability with more than 3400 tries. We have used 271 request counts just for demo purposes._\n\n\n3. Here the attack is completed and we can see in the following image we get **200 OK** status code with the message \"**Ok**\" and response length **1509** on 271st request which was sent at **_Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:32:01 GMT_**.\n\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297159282-3f4788b5-6217-4f32-8be6-40ac117710e3.png)\n\nThis means attacker can try 271 requests in 56 seconds.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to get super user-level access over the server.\n\n\n### Mitigation\nIt is recommended to implement a proper rate-limiting mechanism on the server side where the configuration might be like:\nIf a specific IP address fails to login more than 5 times concurrently then that IP address must be blocked for at least 30 seconds. This will reduce the possibility of password brute-forcing attacks.\n",
