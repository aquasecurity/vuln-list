  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-55885",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/beego/beego",
  "Title": "Beego has Collision Hazards of MD5 in Cache Key Filenames",
  "Description": "In the context of using MD5 to generate filenames for cache keys, there are significant collision hazards that need to be considered. MD5, or Message Digest Algorithm 5, is a widely known cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. However, MD5 is no longer considered secure against well-funded opponents due to its vulnerability to collision attacks.",
