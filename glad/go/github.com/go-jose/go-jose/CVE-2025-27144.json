  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27144",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/go-jose/go-jose",
  "Title": "DoS in go-jose Parsing",
  "Description": "When parsing compact JWS or JWE input, go-jose could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, \".\") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of '.' characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service.",
