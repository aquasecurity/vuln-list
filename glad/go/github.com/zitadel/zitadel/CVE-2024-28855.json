  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28855",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/zitadel/zitadel",
  "Title": "Improper HTML sanitization in ZITADEL",
  "Description": "ZITADEL uses Go templates to render the login UI.\n\nDue to a improper use of the `text/template` instead of the `html/template` package, the Login UI did not sanitize input parameters. An attacker could create a malicious link, where he injected code which would be rendered as part of the login screen.\nWhile it was possible to inject HTML including javascript, the execution of such scripts would be prevented by the Content Security Policy.",
