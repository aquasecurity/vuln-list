  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-29892",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/zitadel/zitadel",
  "Title": "ZITADEL's actions can overload reserved claims",
  "Description": "Under certain circumstances an action could set [reserved claims](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/openidoauth/claims#reserved-claims) managed by ZITADEL.\n\nFor example it would be possible to set the claim `urn:zitadel:iam:user:resourceowner:name`\n\n```json\n{\"urn:zitadel:iam:user:resourceowner:name\": \"ACME\"}\n```\n\nif it was not set by ZITADEL itself.\n\nTo compensate for this we introduced a protection that does prevent actions from changing claims that start with `urn:zitadel:iam`",
