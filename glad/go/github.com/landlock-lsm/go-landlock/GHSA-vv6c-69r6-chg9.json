  "Title": "Go-Landlock in best-effort mode did not restrict TCP bind and connect operations correctly",
  "Description": "When using the recommended \"best-effort\" mode, Go-Landlock did not restrict the TCP bind() and connect() operations any more when they were requested.  This affects Go-Landlock users to whom both of the following conditions apply:\n\n* They use Landlock rulesets that are supposed to restrict networking (through `landlock.V4`, `landlock.V5`, or self-configured).\n* These Landlock rulesets are used in best-effort mode.\n\nTypically, affected code uses the Go-Landlock API like this (the crucial part being the combination of `V4`/`V5` and `.BestEffort()`):\n\n```\nerr := landlock.V5.BestEffort().Restrict(...)\n```\n\n* This is a bug in the Go-Landlock library and does not affect programs that use Landlock via C or other language bindings.\n* The bug only affects networking restrictions. File system restrictions continue to work as expected.",
