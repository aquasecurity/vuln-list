  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver",
  "Title": "OpenTelemetry Collector module AWS Firehose Receiver Authentication Bypass Vulnerability",
  "Description": "OpenTelemetry Collector module [`awsfirehosereceiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver) allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key.\n\nOpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. [Firehose sets the header](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html) `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming requests with no key**.",
