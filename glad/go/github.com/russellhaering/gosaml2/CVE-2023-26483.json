  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-26483",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2",
  "Title": "gosaml2 vulnerable to Denial Of Service Via Deflate Decompression Bomb",
  "Description": "### Impact\nSAML Service Providers using this library for SAML authentication support are likely susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. A bug in this library enables attackers to craft a `deflate`-compressed request which will consume significantly more memory during processing than the size of the original request. This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion and the process being killed.\n\n### Mitigation\nThe maximum compression ratio achievable with `deflate` is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that lots of memory is available to the process it _may_ be possible to help Go's garbage collector \"keep up\".\n\nImplementors are encouraged not to rely on this.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is addressed in v0.9.0",
