  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-31054",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-events",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1.",
