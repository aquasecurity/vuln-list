  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-8828",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd",
  "Title": "Insecure Default Initialization of Resource",
  "Description": "As of v1.5.0, the default admin password is set to the argocd-server pod name. For insiders with access to the cluster or logs, this issue could be abused for privilege escalation, as Argo has privileged roles. A malicious insider is the most realistic threat, but pod names are not meant to be kept secret and could wind up just about anywhere.",
