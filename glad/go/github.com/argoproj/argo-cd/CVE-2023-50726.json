  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-50726",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd",
  "Title": "Users with `create` but not `override` privileges can perform local sync",
  "Description": "\"Local sync\" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git.\n\nAn improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is _not_ enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.\n\nThe bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added.",
