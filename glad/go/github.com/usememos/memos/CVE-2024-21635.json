  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-21635",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/usememos/memos",
  "Title": "Memos' Access Tokens Stay Valid after User Password Change",
  "Description": "Access Tokens are used to authenticate application access. When a user changes their password, the existing list of Access Tokens stay valid instead of expiring. If a user finds that their account has been compromised, they can update their password.\n\nThe bad actor though will still have access to their account because the bad actor's Access Token stays on the list as a valid token. The user will have to manually delete the bad actor's Access Token to secure their account. The list of Access Tokens has a generic Description which makes it hard to pinpoint a bad actor in a list of Access Tokens.",
