  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45496",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/openshift/openshift-controller-manager",
  "Title": "OpenShift Controller Manager Improper Privilege Management",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.",
