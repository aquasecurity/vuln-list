  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-25132",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/openshift/hive",
  "Title": "OpenShift Hive Has an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Hive hibernation controller component of OpenShift Dedicated. The ClusterDeployment.hive.openshift.io/v1 resource can be created with the spec.installed field set to true, regardless of the installation status, and a positive timespan for the spec.hibernateAfter value. If a ClusterSync.hiveinternal.openshift.io/v1alpha1 resource is also created, the hive hibernation controller will enter the reconciliation loop leading to a panic when accessing a non-existing field in the ClusterDeploymentâ€™s status section, resulting in a denial of service.",
