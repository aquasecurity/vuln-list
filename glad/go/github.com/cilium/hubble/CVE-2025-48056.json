  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cilium/hubble",
  "Title": "Character injection in Hubble CLI",

Exploitation of this attack would require the victim to be monitoring Kafka traffic using [Layer 7 Protocol Visibility](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/visibility/#layer-7-protocol-visibility) at the time of the attack.",
