  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28249",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cilium/cilium",
  "Title": "Unencrypted traffic between nodes when using IPsec and L7 policies",
  "Description": "In Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies:\n\n- Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted\n- Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted\n\n**Note:** For clusters running in native routing mode, IPsec encryption is not applied to connections which are selected by a L7 Egress Network Policy or a DNS Policy. This is a known limitation of Cilium's IPsec encryption which will continue to apply after upgrading to the latest Cilium versions described below.",
