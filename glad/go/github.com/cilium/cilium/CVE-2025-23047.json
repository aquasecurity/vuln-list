  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-23047",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cilium/cilium",
  "Title": "Cilium has an information leakage via insecure default Hubble UI CORS header",
  "Description": "For users who deploy Hubble UI using either Cilium CLI or via the Cilium Helm chart, an insecure default `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header value could lead to sensitive data exposure. A user with access to a Hubble UI instance affected by this issue could leak configuration details about the Kubernetes cluster which Hubble UI is monitoring, including node names, IP addresses, and other metadata about workloads and the cluster networking configuration. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, a victim would have to first visit a malicious page.",
