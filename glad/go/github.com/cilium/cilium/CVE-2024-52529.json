  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-52529",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cilium/cilium",
  "Title": "Cilium's Layer 7 policy enforcement may not occur in policies with wildcarded port ranges",
  "Description": "For users with the following configuration:\n\n* An allow policy that selects a [Layer 3 identity](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.14/security/policy/language/#layer-3-examples) and a [port range](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#example-port-ranges) **AND**\n* A [Layer 7 allow policy](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/language/#layer-7-examples) that selects a specific port within the first policy's range\n\nthen Layer 7 enforcement would not occur for the traffic selected by the Layer 7 policy.\n\nThis issue only affects users who use Cilium's port range functionality, which was introduced in Cilium v1.16.\n\nFor reference, an example of a pair of policies that would trigger this issue is:\n\n```\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\nname: \"layer-3-and-4\"\nspec:\nendpointSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp: service\ningress:\n- fromCIDR:\n- 192.168.60.0/24\ntoPorts:\n- ports:\n- port: \"80\"\nendPort: 444\nprotocol: TCP\n```\nand\n```\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\nname: \"layer-4-and-7\"\nspec:\nendpointSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp: service\ningress:\ntoPorts:\n- ports:\n- port: \"80\"\nprotocol: TCP\nrules:\nhttp:\n- method: \"GET\"\npath: \"/public\"\n```\n\nIn the above example, requests would be permitted to all HTTP paths on matching endpoints, rather than just `GET` requests to the `/public` path as intended by the `layer-4-and-7` policy. In patched versions of Cilium, the `layer-4-and-7` rule would take precedence over the `layer-3-and-4` rule.",
