  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-42487",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cilium/cilium",
  "Title": "Gateway API route matching order contradicts specification",
  "Description": "Gateway API HTTPRoutes and GRPCRoutes do not follow the match precedence specified in the Gateway API specification. In particular, request headers are matched before request methods, when the specification describes that the request methods must be respected before headers are matched ([HTTPRouteRule](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRouteRule), [GRPCRouteRule](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io%2fv1.GRPCRouteRule)).\n\nIf users create Gateway API resources that use both request headers and request methods in order to route to different destinations, then traffic may be delivered to the incorrect backend. If the backend does not have Network Policy restricting acceptable traffic to receive, then requests may access information that you did not intend for them to access.",
