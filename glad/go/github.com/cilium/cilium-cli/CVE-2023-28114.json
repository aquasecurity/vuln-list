{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-28114",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cilium/cilium-cli",
  "Title": "`cilium-cli` disables etcd authorization for clustermesh clusters",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\n`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. \n\nDue to an incorrect mount point specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2\n\nAll previous versions of `cilium-cli` are affected. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse Cilium's [Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium) to create your cluster instead.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Marco Iorio for investigating and fixing the issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nAs usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io) - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.",
