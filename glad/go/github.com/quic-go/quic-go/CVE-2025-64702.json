  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64702",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/quic-go/quic-go",
  "Title": "quic-go HTTP/3 QPACK Header Expansion DoS",
  "Description": "An attacker can cause excessive memory allocation in quic-go's HTTP/3 client and server implementations by sending a QPACK-encoded HEADERS frame that decodes into a large header field section (many unique header names and/or large values). The implementation builds an `http.Header` (used on the `http.Request` and `http.Response`, respectively), while only enforcing limits on the size of the (QPACK-compressed) HEADERS frame, but not on the decoded header, leading to memory exhaustion.",
