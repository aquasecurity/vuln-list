  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-29785",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/quic-go/quic-go",
  "Title": "quic-go Has Panic in Path Probe Loss Recovery Handling",
  "Description": "The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client.\n\nIn order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference.",
