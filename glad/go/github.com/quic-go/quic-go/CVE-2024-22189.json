  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-22189",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/quic-go/quic-go",
  "Title": "QUIC's Connection ID Mechanism vulnerable to Memory Exhaustion Attack",
  "Description": "An attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate.\n\nI published a more detailed description of the attack and its mitigation in this blog post: https://seemann.io/posts/2024-03-19-exploiting-quics-connection-id-management/.\nI also presented this attack in the IETF QUIC working group session at IETF 119: https://youtu.be/JqXtYcZAtIA?si=nJ31QKLBSTRXY35U\u0026t=3683\n\nThere's no way to mitigate this attack, please update quic-go to a version that contains the fix.",
