  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-53259",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/quic-go/quic-go",
  "Title": "quic-go affected by an ICMP Packet Too Large Injection Attack on Linux",
  "Description": "An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used `IP_PMTUDISC_DO`, the kernel would then return a \"message too large\" error on `sendmsg`, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet.\n\nBy setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection).\n\nAs far as I understand, the kernel tracks the MTU per 4-tuple, so the attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack (assuming that it knows the server's IP and port).",
