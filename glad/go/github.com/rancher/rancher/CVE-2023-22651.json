  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-22651",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/rancher",
  "Title": "Rancher Webhook is misconfigured during upgrade process",
  "Description": "A failure in the update logic of Rancher's admission Webhook may lead to the misconfiguration of the Webhook. This component enforces validation rules and security checks before resources are admitted into the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nWhen the Webhook is operating in a degraded state, it no longer validates any resources, which may result in severe privilege escalations and data corruption.\n\nThe issue only affects users that upgrade from `2.6.x` or `2.7.x` to `2.7.2`. Users that did a fresh install of 2.7.2 (and did not follow an upgrade path) are not affected.\n\nThe command below can be executed on the `local` cluster to determine whether the cluster is affected by this issue:\n\n```sh\n$ kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io rancher.cattle.io\n\nNAME                WEBHOOKS   AGE\nrancher.cattle.io   0         19h\n```\n\nIf the resulting webhook quantity is `0`, the Rancher instance is affected.",
