  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-52282",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/rancher",
  "Title": "Rancher Helm Applications may have sensitive values leaked",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager whereby applications installed via Rancher Manager Apps Catalog store their Helm values directly into the `Apps` Custom Resource Definition, resulting in any users with `GET` access to it to be able to read any sensitive information that are contained within the Appsâ€™ values. Additionally, the same information leaks into auditing logs when the audit level is set to equal or above 2.\n\nApplication charts without sensitive data are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability impacts any Helm applications installed on a Rancher Manager cluster, regardless of it being installed via the Marketplace or using the helm cli.\n\nPlease consult the associated [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/) for further information about this category of attack.",
