  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-20321",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/rancher",
  "Title": "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Rancher 2 through 2.1.5. Any project member with access to the default namespace can mount the netes-default service account in a pod, and then use that pod to execute administrative privileged commands against the k8s cluster. This could be mitigated by isolating the default namespace in a separate project, where only cluster admins can be given permissions to access. As of 2018-12-20, this bug affected ALL clusters created or imported by Rancher.",
