  "Title": "Rancher does not automatically clean up a user deleted or disabled from the configured Authentication Provider",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in which Rancher does not automatically clean up a user which has been deleted from the configured authentication provider (AP). This characteristic also applies to disabled or revoked users, Rancher will not reflect these modifications which may leave the user’s tokens still usable.\n\nAn AP must be enabled to be affected by this, as the built-in User Management feature is not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis issue may lead to an adversary gaining unauthorized access, as the user’s access privileges may still be active within Rancher even though they are no longer valid on the configured AP (please consult the [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Technique - Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/) for further information about the associated technique of attack).",
