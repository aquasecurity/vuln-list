  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-58260",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/rancher",
  "Title": "Rancher update on users can deny the service to the admin",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager where a missing server-side validation on the `.username` field in Rancher can allow users with update permissions on other User resources to cause denial of access for targeted accounts. Specifically:\n\n- Username takeover: A user with permission to update another user’s resource can set its `.username` to \"admin\", preventing both the legitimate admin and the affected user from logging in, as Rancher enforces uniqueness at login time.\n- Account lockout: A user with update permissions on the admin account can change the admin’s username, effectively blocking administrative access to the Rancher UI.\n\nThis issue enables a malicious or compromised account with elevated update privileges on User resources to disrupt platform administration and user authentication.",
