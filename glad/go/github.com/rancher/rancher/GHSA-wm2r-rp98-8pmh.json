  "Title": "Exposure of SSH credentials in Rancher/Fleet",
  "Description": "This vulnerability only affects customers using Fleet for continuous delivery with authenticated Git and/or Helm repositories. A security vulnerability (CVE-2022-29810) was discovered in go-getter library in versions prior to v1.5.11 that exposes SSH private keys in base64 format due to a failure in redacting such information from error messages. The vulnerable version of this library is used in Rancher through Fleet in versions of Fleet prior to v0.3.9. This issue affects Rancher versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3.\nWhen Git and/or Helm authentication is configured in Fleet and Fleet is used to deploy a git repo through Continuous Delivery, the affected go-getter version will expose the configured SSH private key secret if Fleet fails to download the git repo due to a misconfigured URL. The exposed SSH key is logged in base64 format as a query parameter together with the git URL. The credentials can be seen in Rancher UI and in Fleet's deployment pod logs.",
