  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-22031",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/rancher",
  "Title": "Rancher users who can create Projects can gain access to arbitrary projects",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a user with the ability to create a project, on a certain cluster, can create a project with the same name as an existing project in a different cluster. This results in the user gaining access to the other project in the different cluster, resulting in a privilege escalation. This happens because the namespace used on the local cluster to store related resources (PRTBs and secrets) is the name of the project.\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Technique - Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/) for further information about this category of attack.",
