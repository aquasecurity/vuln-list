  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-32198",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/stev",
  "Title": "Steve doesn’t verify a server’s certificate and is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Steve where by default it was using an insecure option that did not validate the certificate presented by the remote server while performing a TLS connection. This could allow the execution of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against services using Steve.\n\nFor example, Rancher relies on Steve as a dependency for its user interface (UI) to proxy requests to Kubernetes clusters. Users who have the permission to create a service in Rancher’s local cluster can take over Rancher’s UI and display their own UI to gather sensitive information. This is only possible when the setting `ui-offline-preferred` is manually set to `remote` (by default Rancher sets it to `dynamic`). This enables further attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), or tampering the UI to collect passwords from other users etc.\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Technique - Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/) for further information about this category of attack.",
