  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-23390",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rancher/fleet",
  "Title": "Fleet doesn’t validate a server’s certificate when connecting through SSH",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified within Fleet where, by default, Fleet will automatically trust a remote server’s certificate when connecting through SSH if the certificate isn’t set in the `known_hosts` file. This could allow the execution of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against Fleet. In case the server that is being connected to has a trusted entry in the known_hosts file, then Fleet will correctly check the authenticity of the presented certificate.\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Technique - Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/) for further information about this category of attack.",
