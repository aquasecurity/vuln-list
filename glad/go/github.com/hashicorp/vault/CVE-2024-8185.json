  "Title": "Hashicorp Vault vulnerable to denial of service through memory exhaustion",
  "Description": "Vault Community and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) clusters using Vault’s Integrated Storage backend are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack through memory exhaustion through a Raft cluster join API endpoint.
