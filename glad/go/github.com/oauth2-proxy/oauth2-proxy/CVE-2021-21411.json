  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy",
  "Title": "OAuth2-Proxy's `--gitlab-group` GitLab Group Authorization config flag stopped working in v7.0.0",
  "Description": "The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release.\n\nRegardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application.\n\nWhile adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed.",
