  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-41338",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/gofiber/fiber",
  "Title": "Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation",
  "Description": "Fiber is an Express inspired web framework built in the go language. Versions of gofiber prior to 2.49.2 does not properly restrict access to localhost. This issue impacts users of our project who rely on the `ctx.IsFromLocal` method to restrict access to localhost requests. If exploited, it could allow unauthorized access to resources intended only for localhost. Setting `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` in a request from a foreign host, will result in true for `ctx.IsFromLocal`. Access is limited to the scope of the affected process. This issue has been patched in version `2.49.2` with commit `b8c9ede6`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading to the patched version. ",
