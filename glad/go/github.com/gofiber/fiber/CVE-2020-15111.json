{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15111",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/gofiber/fiber",
  "Title": "Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "In Fiber, the filename that is given in `c.Attachment()` is not escaped, and therefore vulnerable for a CRLF injection attack. An attacker could upload a custom filename and then give the link to the victim. With this filename, the attacker can change the name of the downloaded file, redirect to another site, change the authorization header, etc. A possible workaround is to serialize the input before passing it to `ctx.Attachment()`.",
