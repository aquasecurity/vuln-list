  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54801",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/gofiber/fiber",
  "Title": "Fiber Crashes in BodyParser Due to Unvalidated Large Slice Index in Decoder",
  "Description": "When using Fiber's `Ctx.BodyParser` to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., `test.18446744073704`), the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder.\n\nThe root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length `idx + 1` without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If `idx` is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion, causing a panic or crash.",
