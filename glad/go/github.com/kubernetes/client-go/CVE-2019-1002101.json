  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-1002101",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kubernetes/client-go",
  "Title": "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access",
  "Description": "The kubectl `cp` command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user's machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user's machine when kubectl `cp` is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The `untar` function can both create and follow symbolic links.",
