  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-53263",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs",
  "Title": "Git LFS permits exfiltration of credentials via crafted HTTP URLs",
  "Description": "When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host.  By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials.",
