  "Title": "Babylon Nil BlockHash in BLS vote extensions triggers panics in consensus handlers",
  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in Babylon’s BLS vote extension processing where a malicious active validator can submit a VoteExtension with the `block_hash` field omitted from the protobuf serialization. Because protobuf fields are optional, unmarshalling succeeds but leaves `BlockHash` as nil. Babylon then dereferences this nil pointer in consensus-critical code paths (notably `VerifyVoteExtension`, and also proposal-time vote verification), causing a runtime panic.",
