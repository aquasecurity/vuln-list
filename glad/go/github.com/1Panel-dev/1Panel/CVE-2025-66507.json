  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66507",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel",
  "Title": "1Panel – CAPTCHA Bypass via Client-Controlled Flag ",
  "Description": "A CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability in the 1Panel authentication API allows an unauthenticated attacker to disable CAPTCHA verification by abusing a client-controlled parameter. Because the server previously trusted this value without proper validation, CAPTCHA protections could be bypassed, enabling automated login attempts and significantly increasing the risk of account takeover (ATO).",
