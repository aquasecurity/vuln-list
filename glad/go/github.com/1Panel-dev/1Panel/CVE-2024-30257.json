  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-30257",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel",
  "Title": "1Panel's password verification is suspected to have a timing attack vulnerability",
  "Description": "源码中密码校验处使用 != 符号，而不是`hmac.Equal`，这可能导致产生计时攻击漏洞，从而爆破密码。\n建议使用 `hmac.Equal` 比对密码。\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe source code uses the != symbol instead of hmac.Equal for password verification, which may lead to timing attack vulnerabilities that can lead to password cracking. It is recommended to use hmac. Equal to compare passwords.",
