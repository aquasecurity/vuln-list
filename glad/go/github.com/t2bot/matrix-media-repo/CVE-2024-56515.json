  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-56515",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo",
  "Title": "Matrix Media Repo (MMR) allows untrusted file formats can be thumbnailed, invoking potentially further untrusted decoders",
  "Description": "If SVG or JPEGXL thumbnailers are enabled (they are disabled by default), a user may upload a file which claims to be either of these types and request a thumbnail to invoke a different decoder in ImageMagick. In some ImageMagick installations, this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode the image/file.\n\nIf MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same issue as above may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead.\n\nMMR uses a number of other decoders for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit.",
