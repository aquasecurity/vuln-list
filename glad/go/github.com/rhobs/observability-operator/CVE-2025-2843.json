  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-2843",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rhobs/observability-operator",
  "Title": "Observability Operator is vulnerable to Incorrect Privilege Assignment through its Custom Resource MonitorStack",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Observability Operator. The Operator creates a ServiceAccount with *ClusterRole* upon deployment of the *Namespace-Scoped* Custom Resource MonitorStack. This issue allows an adversarial Kubernetes Account with only namespaced-level roles, for example, a tenant controlling a namespace, to create a MonitorStack in the authorized namespace and then elevate permission to the cluster level by impersonating the ServiceAccount created by the Operator, resulting in privilege escalation and other issues.",
