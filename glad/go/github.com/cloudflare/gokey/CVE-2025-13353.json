  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-13353",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cloudflare/gokey",
  "Title": "gokey allows secret recovery from a seed file without the master password",
  "Description": "In gokey versions `\u003c0.2.0`, a flaw in the seed decryption logic resulted in passwords incorrectly being derived solely from the initial vector and the AES-GCM authentication tag of the key seed.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in gokey version `0.2.0`. This is a breaking change. The fix has invalidated any passwords/secrets that were derived from the seed file (using the `-s` option). Even if the input seed file stays the same, version `0.2.0` gokey will generate different secrets.",
