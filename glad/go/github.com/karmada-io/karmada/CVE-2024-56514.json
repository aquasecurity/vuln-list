  "Description": "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nBoth in karmadactl and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a karmada initialization could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem.",
