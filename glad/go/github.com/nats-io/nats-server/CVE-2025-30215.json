  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-30215",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/nats-io/nats-server",
  "Title": "NATS Server may fail to authorize certain Jetstream admin APIs",
  "Description": "nats-server did not include authorization checks on 4 separate admin-level JetStream APIs: account purge, server remove,  account stream move, and  account stream cancel-move.\n\nIn all cases, APIs are not properly restricted to system-account users. Instead, _any_ authorized user can execute the APIs, including across account boundaries, as long as the current user merely has permission to publish on `$JS.\u003e`.\n\nOnly the first seems to be of highest severity. All are included in this single report as they seem likely to have the same underlying root cause.\n\nReproduction of the `ACCOUNT.PURGE` case is below. The others are like it.",
