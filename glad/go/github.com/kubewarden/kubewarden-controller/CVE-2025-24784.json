  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24784",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller",
  "Title": "Kubewarden-Controller information leak via AdmissionPolicyGroup Resource",
  "Description": "The [policy group feature](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/policy-groups), added to by the 1.17.0 release, introduced two new types of CRD: ClusterAdmissionPolicyGroup and AdmissionPolicyGroup. The former is cluster wide, while the latter is namespaced.\n\nBy being namespaced, the AdmissionPolicyGroup has a well constrained impact on cluster resources. Hence, it’s considered safe to allow non-admin users to create and manage these resources in the namespaces they own.\nKubewarden policies can be allowed to query the Kubernetes API at evaluation time; these types of policies are called “[context aware](https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/spec/context-aware-policies)“.\nContext aware policies can perform list and get operations against a Kubernetes cluster. The queries are done using the ServiceAccount of the Policy Server instance that hosts the policy. That means that access to the cluster is determined by the RBAC rules that apply to that ServiceAccount.\nThe AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD allowed the deployment of context aware policies. This could allow an attacker to obtain information about resources that are out of their reach, by leveraging a higher access to the cluster granted to the ServiceAccount token used to run the policy.\n\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges that have been granted to the ServiceAccount used to run the Policy Server and assumes that users are using the recommended best practices of keeping the Policy Server's ServiceAccount least privileged. By default, the Kubewarden helm chart grants access to the following resources (cluster wide) only: Namespace, Pod, Deployment and Ingress.",
