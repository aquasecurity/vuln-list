  "Title": "Navidrome has Multiple SQL Injections and ORM Leak",
  "Description": "Navidrome automatically adds parameters in the URL to SQL queries. This can be exploited to access information by adding parameters like `password=...` in the URL (ORM Leak).\n\nFurthermore, the names of the parameters are not properly escaped, leading to SQL Injections.\n\nFinally, the username is used in a `LIKE` statement, allowing people to log in with `%` instead of their username.",
