  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/sylabs/singularity",
  "Title": "Path Traversal",
  "Description": "Singularity (an open source container platform) from has a vulnerability. Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs`, it is possible to `overwrite/create` any files on the host filesystem during the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library:`//` or `shub:`//`.` Image build is also impacted in a more serious way as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to `overwrite/create` files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage` are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity All users are advised to upgrade to especially if they use Singularity mainly for building image as root user.",
