  "Title": "go-grpc-compression has a zstd decompression bombing vulnerability",
  "Description": "A malicious user could cause a denial of service (DoS) when using a specially crafted gRPC request. The decompression mechanism for zstd did not respect the limits imposed by gRPC, allowing rapid memory usage increases.\n\nVersions v1.1.4 through to v1.2.2 made use of the Decoder.DecodeAll function in github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd to decompress data provided by the peer. The vulnerability is exploitable only by attackers who can send gRPC payloads to users of github.com/mostynb/go-grpc-compression/zstd or github.com/mostynb/go-grpc-compression/nonclobbering/zstd.",
