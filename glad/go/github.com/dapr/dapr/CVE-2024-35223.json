  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-35223",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/dapr/dapr",
  "Title": "Dapr API Token Exposure",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that causes a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This issue arises because Dapr sends the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app.\n\nUsers who leverage Dapr for gRPC proxy service invocation and are using the app API token feature are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to version [1.13.3](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3).",
