  "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nUsing cloudevents.WithRoundTripper to create a cloudevents.Client with an authenticated http.RoundTripper causes the go-sdk to leak credentials to arbitrary endpoints.\n\nThe relevant code is [here](https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/blob/67e389964131d55d65cd14b4eb32d57a47312695/v2/protocol/http/protocol.go#L104-L110) (also inline, emphasis added):\n\n\u003cpre\u003eif p.Client == nil {\n  p.Client = **http.DefaultClient**\n}\n\nif p.roundTripper != nil {\n  p.Client.**Transport = p.roundTripper**\n}\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\nWhen the transport is populated with an authenticated transport such as:\n- [oauth2.Transport](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/oauth2#Transport)\n- [idtoken.NewClient(...).Transport](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/idtoken#NewClient)\n\n... then http.DefaultClient is modified with the authenticated transport and will start to send Authorization tokens to\n**any endpoint** it is used to contact!\n\nFound and patched by: @tcnghia and @mattmoor\n\n### Patches\nv.2.15.2\n",
