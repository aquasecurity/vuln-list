  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/devfile/registry-support/registry-library",
  "Title": "Relative Path Traversal",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the decompression function of registry-support. This issue can be triggered if an unauthenticated remote attacker tricks a user into parsing a devfile which uses the `parent` or `plugin` keywords. This could download a malicious archive and cause the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside of the archive, which should not be allowed.",
