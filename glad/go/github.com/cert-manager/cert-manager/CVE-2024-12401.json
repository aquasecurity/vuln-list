  "Title": "Duplicate Advisory: cert-manager ha a potential slowdown / DoS when parsing specially crafted PEM inputs",
  "Description": "# Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-r4pg-vg54-wxx4. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in the cert-manager package. This flaw allows an attacker who can modify PEM data that the cert-manager reads, for example, in a Secret resource, to use large amounts of CPU in the cert-manager controller pod to effectively create a denial-of-service (DoS) vector for the cert-manager in the cluster.",
