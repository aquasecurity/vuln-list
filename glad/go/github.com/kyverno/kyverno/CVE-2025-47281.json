  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-47281",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kyverno/kyverno",
  "Title": "Kyverno's Improper JMESPath Variable Evaluation Lead to Denial of Service",
  "Description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in Kyverno due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the `{{@}}` variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g., `{{@ | non_existent_function }}`).\n\nThis leads to a `nil` value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions, specifically `getValueAsStringMap`, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (`interface {} is nil, not string`). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller (and can lead to full admission controller unavailability in Enforce mode) and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod, leading to service degradation or unavailability.\"",
