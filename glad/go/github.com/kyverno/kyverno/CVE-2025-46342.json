  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-46342",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kyverno/kyverno",
  "Title": "Kyverno vulnerable to bypass of policy rules that use namespace selectors in match statements",
  "Description": "Due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go` it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their `match` statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations.",
