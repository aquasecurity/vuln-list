  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/consensys/gnark",
  "Title": "gnark affected by denial of service when computing scalar multiplication using fake-GLV algorithm",
  "Description": "For optimizing the scalar multiplication algorithm in circuit for some curves, gnark uses fake-GLV algorithm in case the curve doesn't support true-GLV. For this to work, we need to compute the scalar decomposition using the Half GCD method in gnark-crypto. However, for some of the inputs the algorithm didn't converge quickly enough.\n\nIn case the prover accepts untrusted witness, it could lead to denial of service as the prover gets stuck in a very slowly converging loop.\n\nThanks to @feltroidprime for reporting the issue and proposing a fix.",
