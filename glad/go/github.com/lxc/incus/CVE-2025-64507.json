  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64507",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/lxc/incus",
  "Title": "Incus vulnerable to local privilege escalation through custom storage volumes",
  "Description": "This affects any Incus user in an environment where an unprivileged user may have root access to a container with an attached custom storage volume that has the `security.shifted` property set to `true` as well as access to the host as an unprivileged user.\n\nThe most common case for this would be systems using `incus-user` with the less privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged users with an isolated restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create a custom storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and filesystem support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the container which can be executed as an unpriivleged user on the host to gain root privileges.",
