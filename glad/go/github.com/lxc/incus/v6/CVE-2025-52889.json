  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-52889",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/lxc/incus/v6",
  "Title": "Incus Allocation of Resources Without Limits allows firewall rule bypass on managed bridge networks",
  "Description": "When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus generates nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for other attacks.",
