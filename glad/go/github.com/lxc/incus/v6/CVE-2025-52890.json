  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/lxc/incus/v6",
  "Title": "Incus creates nftables rules that partially bypass security options",
  "Description": "When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus generates nftables rules that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to ARP spoofing on the bridge and to fully spoof another VM/container on the same bridge.",
