  "Title": "Duplicate of ./go/github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/CVE-2022-23495.yml",
  "Description": "A `ProtoNode` may be modified in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB, attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded) `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain states that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due to conformance with the `github.com/ipfs/go-block-format` and `github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format` interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if state has changed, will panic due to the inability to return an error. Additionally, use of the `ProtoNode#SetCidBuilder()` method to set a non-functioning `CidBuilder` (such as one that refers to a multihash where an implementation of that hash function is not available) may cause the same methods to panic as a new CID is required but cannot be created.",
