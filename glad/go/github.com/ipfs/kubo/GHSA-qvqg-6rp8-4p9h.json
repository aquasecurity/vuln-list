  "Title": "github.com/ipfs/kubo affected by DOS Bitswap unbounded persistent memory leak",
  "Description": "An attacker is able allocate arbitrarily many bytes in the Bitswap server by sending many `WANT_BLOCK` and or `WANT_HAVE` requests which are queued in an unbounded queue, with allocations that persist even if the connection is closed.\n\nThis affects users accepting or connecting untrusted connections such as by running in the public swarm and no pnet config.\nNodes that are not publicly reachable but connects to untrusted nodes are also vulnerable to the untrusted nodes being connected to since libp2p connections are blindly bidirectional.",
