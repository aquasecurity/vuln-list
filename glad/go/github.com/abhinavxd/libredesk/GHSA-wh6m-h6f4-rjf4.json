  "Title": "Libredesk has Improper Neutralization of  HTML Tags in a Web Page",
  "Description": "LibreDesk is vulnerable to **stored HTML injection** in the contact notes feature. When adding notes via `POST /api/v1/contacts/{id}/notes`, the backend automatically wraps user input in `\u003cp\u003e` tags. However, by intercepting the request and removing the `\u003cp\u003e` tag, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML elements such as forms and images, which are then stored and rendered without proper sanitization. This can lead to phishing, CSRF-style forced actions, and UI redress attacks.\n\n---",
