  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68156",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/expr-lang/expr",
  "Title": "Expr has Denial of Service via Unbounded Recursion in Builtin Functions",
  "Description": "Several builtin functions in Expr, including `flatten`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `median`, perform\nrecursive traversal over user-provided data structures without enforcing a maximum recursion depth.\n\nIf the evaluation environment contains **deeply nested** or **cyclic** data structures, these functions may recurse\nindefinitely until exceed the Go runtime stack limit. This results in a **stack overflow panic**, causing the host\napplication to crash.\n\nWhile exploitability depends on whether an attacker can influence or inject cyclic or pathologically deep data into the\nevaluation environment, this behavior represents a denial-of-service (DoS) risk and affects overall library robustness.\nInstead of returning a recoverable evaluation error, the process may terminate unexpectedly.",
