  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/openbao/openbao",
  "Title": "OpenBao is Vulnerable to Privileged Operator Identity Group Root Escalation",
  "Description": "Similar to HCSEC-2025-13 / CVE-2025-5999, a privileged operator could use the identity group subsystem to add a root policy to a group identity group, escalating their or another user's permissions in the system. Specifically this is an issue when:\n\n1. An operator in the root namespace has access to `identity/groups` endpoints.\n2. An operator does not have policy access.\n\nOtherwise, an operator with policy access could create or modify an existing policy to grant root-equivalent permissions through the `sudo` capability.",
