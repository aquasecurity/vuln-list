  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59043",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/openbao/openbao",
  "Title": "OpenBao has potential Denial of Service vulnerability when processing malicious unauthenticated JSON requests",
  "Description": "JSON objects after decoding might use more memory than their serialized version. It is possible to tune a JSON to maximize the factor between serialized memory usage and deserialized memory usage (similar to a zip bomb). While reproducing the issue, we could reach a factor of about 35. This can be used to circumvent the [`max_request_size` (https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/listener/tcp/) configuration parameter, which is meant to protect against Denial of Service attacks, and also makes Denial of Service attacks easier in general, as the attacker needs much less resources.",
