  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62705",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/openbao/openbao",
  "Title": "OpenBao and Vault Leak []byte Fields in Audit Logs ",
  "Description": "OpenBao's audit log did not appropriately redact fields when relevant subsystems sent `[]byte` response parameters rather than `string`s. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- `sys/raw` with use of `encoding=base64`, all data would be emitted unredacted to the audit log.\n- Transit, when performing a signing operation with a derived Ed25519 key, would emit public keys to the audit log.\n\nThird-party plugins may be affected.\n\nThis issue has been present since HashiCorp Vault and continues to impact Vault as of v1.20.4.",
