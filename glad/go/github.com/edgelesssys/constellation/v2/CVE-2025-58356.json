  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-58356",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/v2",
  "Title": "Constellation has insecure LUKS2 persistent storage partitions which may be opened and used",
  "Description": "A malicious host may provide a crafted LUKS2 volume to a confidential computing guest that is using the [OpenCryptDevice](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/blob/6eff250f16f8ae48221d412550e4a64a4bf0d77b/csi/cryptmapper/cryptmapper.go#L89) feature. The guest will open the volume and write secret data using a volume key known to the attacker. The attacker can also pre-load data on the device, which could potentially compromise guest execution.\n\n\nLUKS2 volume metadata is not authenticated and supports null key-encryption algorithms, allowing an attacker to create a volume such that the volume:\n- Opens (cryptsetup open) without error using any passphrase or token\n- Records all writes in plaintext (or ciphertext with an attacker-known key)\n- Contains arbitrary data chosen by the attacker",
