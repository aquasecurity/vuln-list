  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-37298",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/gorilla/schema",
  "Title": "Potential memory exhaustion attack due to sparse slice deserialization",
  "Description": "Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. There seems to be no possible solution that a developer using this library can do to disable this behaviour without fixing it in this project, so all uses of Decode that fall under this umbrella are affected. A fix that doesn't require a major change may also be harder to find, since it could break compatibility with some other intended use-cases.",
