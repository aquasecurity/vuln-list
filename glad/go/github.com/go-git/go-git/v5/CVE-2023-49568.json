  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-49568",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5",
  "Title": "Maliciously crafted Git server replies can cause DoS on go-git clients",
  "Description": "### Impact\nA denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.11`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in `go-git` clients. \n\nApplications using only the in-memory filesystem supported by `go-git` are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli.\n\n### Patches\nUsers running versions of `go-git` from `v4` and above are recommended to upgrade to `v5.11` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn cases where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible, we recommend limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.\n\n## Credit\nThanks to Ionut Lalu for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability to us.\n\n### References\n- [GHSA-mw99-9chc-xw7r](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-mw99-9chc-xw7r)\n",
