  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-49569",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/go-git/go-git",
  "Title": "Maliciously crafted Git server replies can lead to path traversal and RCE on go-git clients",
  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.11`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.\n\nApplications are only affected if they are using the [ChrootOS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS), which is the default when using \"Plain\" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using [BoundOS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS) or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.\nThis is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli.",
