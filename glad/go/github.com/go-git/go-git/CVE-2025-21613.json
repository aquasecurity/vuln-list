  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-21613",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/go-git/go-git",
  "Title": "go-git has an Argument Injection via the URL field",
  "Description": "An argument injection vulnerability was discovered in `go-git` versions prior to `v5.13`.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary values to [git-upload-pack flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-upload-pack). This only happens when the `file` transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol that shells out to `git` binaries.",
