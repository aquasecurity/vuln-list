  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26241",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum",
  "Title": "Incorrect Calculation",
  "Description": "Go Ethereum, or \"Geth\", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth which can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth's pre-compiled dataCopy (at `0x00..0x04`) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region R, then calls `0x00..0x04` with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally invokes the `RETURNDATACOPY` opcode. When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push X on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed ",
