  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64435",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt",
  "Title": "KubeVirt VMI Denial-of-Service (DoS) Using Pod Impersonation",
  "Description": "_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible.\n\nA logic flaw in the `virt-controller` allows an attacker to disrupt the control over a running VMI by creating a pod with the same labels as the legitimate `virt-launcher` pod associated with the VMI. This can mislead the `virt-controller` into associating the fake pod with the VMI, resulting in incorrect status updates and potentially causing a DoS (Denial-of-Service).",
