  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-22197",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/0xJacky/Nginx-UI",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')",
  "Description": "Nginx-ui is online statistics for Server Indicators​​ Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, load average, and disk usage in real-time. The `Home \u003e Preference` page exposes a small list of nginx settings such as `Nginx Access Log Path` and `Nginx Error Log Path`. However, the API also exposes `test_config_cmd`, `reload_cmd` and `restart_cmd`. While the UI does not allow users to modify any of these settings, it is possible to do so by sending a request to the API. This issue may lead to authenticated Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Information Disclosure. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0-beta.9.",
