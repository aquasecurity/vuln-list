  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23820",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/openfga/openfga",
  "Title": "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling",
  "Description": "OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to `ListObjects` may not release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an `out of memory` error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue.",
