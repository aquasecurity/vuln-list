  "Title": "Malformed CAR panics and excessive memory usage",
  "Description": "Decoding CAR data from untrusted user input can cause, panics, out-of-bound memory access, out of memory, divide by zero, and excessive memory usage. Such panics can be triggered by intentionally malformed CARv1 data, including CARv1 data within a CARv2 container; and also CARv2 data with excessively large indexes. These vulnerabilities are not known to be exploited in the wild and were discovered primarily with the use of code fuzzing tooling.",
