  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27421",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/abacus",
  "Title": "Goroutine Leak in Abacus SSE Implementation",
  "Description": "A critical goroutine leak vulnerability has been identified in the Abacus server's Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue occurs when clients disconnect from the `/stream` endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves improper channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely.",
