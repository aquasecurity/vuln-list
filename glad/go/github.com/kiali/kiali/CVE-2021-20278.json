  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-20278",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kiali/kiali",
  "Title": "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing",
  "Description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Kiali in versions before 1.31.0 when the authentication strategy `OpenID` is used. When RBAC is enabled, Kiali assumes that some of the token validation is handled by the underlying cluster. When OpenID `implicit flow` is used with RBAC turned off, this token validation doesn't occur, and this allows a malicious user to bypass the authentication.",
