  "Title": "Git credentials are exposed in Atlantis logs",
  "Description": "_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server._\n\nAtlantis logs contains GitHub credentials (tokens `ghs_...`) when they are rotated. This enables an attacker able to read these logs to impersonate Atlantis application and to perform actions on GitHub.\n\nWhen Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables getting administration privileges on the organization.\n\nThis was reported in https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060 and fixed in https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667 . The fix was included in [Atlantis v0.30.0](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/tag/v0.30.0).",
