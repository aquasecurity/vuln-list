  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-4318",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cri-o/cri-o",
  "Title": "CRI-O vulnerable to /etc/passwd tampering resulting in Privilege Escalation",
  "Description": "### Impact\nIt is possible to craft an environment variable with newlines to add entries to a container's /etc/passwd. It is possible to circumvent admission validation of username/UID by adding such an entry.\n\nNote: because the pod author is in control of the container's /etc/passwd, this is not considered a new risk factor. However, this advisory is being opened for transparency and as a way of tracking fixes.\n\n### Patches\n1.26.0 will have the fix. More patches will be posted as they're available.\n\n### Workarounds\nAdditional security controls like SELinux should prevent any damage a container is able to do with root on the host. Using SELinux is recommended because this class of attack is already possible by manually editing the container's /etc/passwd \n\n### References\n",
