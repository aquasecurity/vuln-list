  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47832",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/ssoready/ssoready",
  "Title": "SSOReady has an XML Signature Bypass via differential XML parsing",
  "Description": "Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers.\n\nUsers of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from `sha-...` to `sha-7f92a06`. The documentation for self-hosting SSOReady is available [here](https://ssoready.com/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready).\n\nVulnerability was discovered by @ahacker1-securesaml. It's likely the precise mechanism of attack affects other SAML implementations, so the reporter and I (@ucarion) have agreed to not disclose it in detail publicly at this time.",
