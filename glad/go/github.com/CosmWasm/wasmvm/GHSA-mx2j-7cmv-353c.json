  "Title": "wasmvm: Malicious smart contract can slow down block production",
  "Description": "# CWA-2025-002\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm \u003e= 2.2.0, \u003c 2.2.2\n- wasmvm \u003e= 2.1.0, \u003c 2.1.5\n- wasmvm \u003e= 2.0.0, \u003c 2.0.6\n- wasmvm \u003c 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5, 2.2.2\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nThe vulnerability can be used to slow down block production. The attack requires a malicious contract,\nso permissioned chains are unlikely to be affected.\n\n(We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)\n\n## Patch\n\n- 1.5: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/2b7f2faa57a1efc8207455c37f87f1eee6035a27\n- 2.0: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/d6143b0aff16a39bbea4be37597d8e9d9b213d3b\n- 2.1: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/f0c04c03cbe2557634c1bbcdc2ce203fe7caca58\n- 2.2: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/a5d62f65b5eb947ebe40e2085b1c48a9d0a244d0\n\n## Applying the patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in releases of wasmvm. You can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` dependency in your go.mod to one of the patched version\n   depending on which minor version you are on; `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, update them accordingly.\n4. Check the updated wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and ensure you see 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5 or 2.2.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nThe patch is consensus breaking and requires a coordinated upgrade.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see \u003chttps://hackerone.com/cosmos\u003e.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-11-24: Confio receives a report through the Cosmos bug bounty program maintained by Amulet.\n- 2024-12-20: Confio security contributors confirm the report.\n- 2024-01-27: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2025-02-04: Patch gets released.",
