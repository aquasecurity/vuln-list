  "Description": "A specifically crafted Wasm file can cause the VM to consume excessive amounts of memory when compiling a contract.\nThis can lead to high memory usage, slowdowns, potentially a crash and can poison a lock in the VM,\npreventing any further interaction with contracts.\n\nFor more information, see [CWA-2023-004](https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2023-004.md).",
