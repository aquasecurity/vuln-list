  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59824",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/siderolabs/omni",
  "Title": "Omni Wireguard SideroLink potential escape",
  "Description": "This vulnerability creates two distinct attack scenarios based on Omni's `IP forwarding` configuration.\n\n1.  **IP Forwarding Disabled (Default)**\nIf `IP forwarding` is disabled, an attacker on a Talos machine can send packets over SideroLink to any listening service on Omni itself (e.g., an internal API). If Omni is running in host networking mode, any service on the host machine could also be targeted. While this is the default configuration, Omni does not enforce it.\n\n2.  **IP Forwarding Enabled**\nIf `IP forwarding` is enabled, an attacker on a Talos machine can communicate with other machines connected to Omni or route packets deeper into Omni's network. Although this is not the default configuration, Omni does not check for or prevent this state.",
