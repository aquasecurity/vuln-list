  "Title": "nftables binding to an already bound chain",
  "Description": "### Impact\nAn issue was discovered in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel. A denial of service can occur upon binding to an already bound chain.\n\nAffected by this vulnerability is the function nft_verdict_init of the file net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a denial of service vulnerability. The program does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n### Patches\nThe fix has been backported to [5.15.64](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves/CVE-2022-39190) version of the upstream Linux kernel (5.15 is the upstream Kernel long term version Talos ships with). Talos \u003e= v1.2.0 is shipped with Linux Kernel 5.15.64 fixing the above issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt's recommended to upgrade\n\n### References\n- https://www.sesin.at/2022/09/02/cve-2022-39190-linux-kernel-up-to-5-19-5-nf_tables_api-c-nft_verdict_init-denial-of-service/\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39190\n\n### For more information\n- Email us at [security@siderolabs.com](mailto:security@siderolabs.com)",
