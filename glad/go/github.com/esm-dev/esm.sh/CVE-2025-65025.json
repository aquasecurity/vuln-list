  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh",
  "Title": "esm.sh CDN service has arbitrary file write via tarslip",
  "Description": "The esm.sh CDN service is vulnerable to a Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability during NPM package tarball extraction.\nAn attacker can craft a malicious NPM package containing specially crafted file paths (e.g., `package/../../tmp/evil.js`).\nWhen esm.sh downloads and extracts this package, files may be written to arbitrary locations on the server, escaping the intended extraction directory.\n\nUploading files containing `../` in the path is not allowed on official registries (npm, GitHub), but the `X-Npmrc` header allows specifying any arbitrary registry.\nBy setting the registry to an attacker-controlled server via the `X-Npmrc` header, this vulnerability can be triggered.",
