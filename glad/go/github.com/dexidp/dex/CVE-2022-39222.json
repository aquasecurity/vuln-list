  "Description": "Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Patches: Update to 2.35.0. Workarounds: No known workarounds (without impacting behavior) for existing versions. Disabling public clients is the only way to defend against attacks exploiting this vulnerability.",
