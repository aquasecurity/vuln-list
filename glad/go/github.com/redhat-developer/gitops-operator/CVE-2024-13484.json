The openshift.io/cluster-monitoring label is applied to all namespaces that deploy an ArgoCD CR instance, allowing the namespace to create a rogue PrometheusRule. This issue can have adverse effects on the platform monitoring stack, as the rule is rolled out cluster-wide when the label is applied.",
