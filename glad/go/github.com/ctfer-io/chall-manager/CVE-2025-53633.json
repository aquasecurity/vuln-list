  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-53633",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager",
  "Title": "Chall-Manager's scenario decoding process does not check for zip bombs",
  "Description": "When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive), the size of the decoded content is not checked, potentially leading to zip bombs decompression.\nExploitation does not require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could reach the system.",
