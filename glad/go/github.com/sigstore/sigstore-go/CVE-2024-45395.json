  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-45395",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go",
  "Title": "sigstore-go has an unbounded loop over untrusted input can lead to endless data attack",
  "Description": "sigstore-go is susceptible to a denial of service attack when a verifier is provided a maliciously crafted Sigstore Bundle containing large amounts of verifiable data, in the form of signed transparency log entries, RFC 3161 timestamps, and attestation subjects. The verification of these data structures is computationally expensive. This can be used to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service attack. TUF's security model labels this type of vulnerability an \"Endless data attack,\" and can lead to verification failing to complete and disrupting services that rely on sigstore-go for verification.\n\nThe vulnerable loops are in the verification functions in the package `github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/pkg/verify`. The first is the DSSE envelope verification loop in `verifyEnvelopeWithArtifact`, which decodes all the digests in an attestation can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/blob/725e508ed4933e6f5b5206e32af4bbe76f587b54/pkg/verify/signature.go#L183-L193\n\nThe next loop is in the `VerifyArtifactTransparencyLog` function, which verifies all the signed entries in a bundle:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/blob/725e508ed4933e6f5b5206e32af4bbe76f587b54/pkg/verify/tlog.go#L74-L178\n\nThe next loop is the `VerifyTimestampAuthority` function, which verifies all the RFC 3161 timestamps in a bundle:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/blob/725e508ed4933e6f5b5206e32af4bbe76f587b54/pkg/verify/tsa.go#L59-L68",
