  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6219",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/canonical/lxd",
  "Title": "lxd has a restricted TLS certificate privilege escalation when in PKI mode",
  "Description": "If a `server.ca` file is present in `LXD_DIR` at LXD start up, LXD is in \"PKI mode\". In this mode, all clients must have certificates that have been signed by the CA.\n\nThe LXD configuration option `core.trust_ca_certificates` defaults to `false`. This means that although the client certificate has been signed by the CA, LXD will additionally add the certificate to the trust store and verify it via mTLS.\n\nWhen a restricted certificate is added to the trust store in this mode, it's restrictions are not honoured, and the client has full access to LXD.",
