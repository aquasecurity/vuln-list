  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54290",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/canonical/lxd",
  "Title": "Canonical LXD Project Existence Determination Through Error Handling in Image Export Function",
  "Description": "In LXD's images export API (`/1.0/images/{fingerprint}/export`), implementation differences in error handling allow determining project existence without authentication.\n\nSpecifically, in the following code, errors when multiple images match are directly returned to users as API responses:\n\nhttps://github.com/canonical/lxd/blob/43d5189564d27f6161b430ed258c8b56603c2759/lxd/db/images.go#L239-L246\n\nWhile fingerprints generally don't duplicate, this functionality uses fingerprints with LIKE clauses, allowing prefix specification. Therefore, using LIKE wildcards such as % will match multiple images if multiple images exist in the project.\n\nhttps://github.com/canonical/lxd/blob/43d5189564d27f6161b430ed258c8b56603c2759/lxd/db/images.go#L277-L286\n\nIn the above implementation, multiple matches result in a 500 error, but if the project itself doesn't exist, there are 0 matches and a 404 is returned.\n\n1. When project exists and multiple images match: HTTP 500 error \"More than one image matches\"\n2. When project doesn't exist: HTTP 404 error \"not found\"\n\nThis behavioural difference allows attackers to confirm project existence without authentication.",
