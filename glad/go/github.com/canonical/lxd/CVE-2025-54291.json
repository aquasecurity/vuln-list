  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54291",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/canonical/lxd",
  "Title": "Canonical LXD Project Existence Determination Through Error Handling in Image Get Function",
  "Description": "The LXD /1.0/images endpoint is implemented as an AllowUntrusted API that requires no authentication, making it accessible to users without accounts. This API allows determining project existence through differences in HTTP status codes when accessed with the project parameter.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/canonical/lxd/blob/43d5189564d27f6161b430ed258c8b56603c2759/lxd/images.go#L63-L69\n\nThis configuration allows access without authentication:\n\nhttps://github.com/canonical/lxd/blob/43d5189564d27f6161b430ed258c8b56603c2759/lxd/daemon.go#L924-L926\n\nThis API returns a 404 error when accessing existing projects and a 403 error when accessing non-existent projects, allowing confirmation of project existence through this difference.\n\nThe problematic implementation is shown below.\n\nFirst, in the error handling implementation of the imagesGet function below, project existence is checked within the `projectutils.ImageProject` function, and the err returned by the `ImageProject` function is directly returned to the user.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/canonical/lxd/blob/43d5189564d27f6161b430ed258c8b56603c2759/lxd/i mages.go#L1781-L1788\n\nWhen the project doesn't exist, the error is 404 (http.StatusNotFound), which is\nreturned to the user:",
