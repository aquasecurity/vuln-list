  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6156",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/canonical/lxd",
  "Title": "lxd CA certificate sign check bypass",
  "Description": "If a `server.ca` file is present in `LXD_DIR` at LXD start up, LXD is in \"PKI mode\". In this mode, only TLS clients that have a CA-signed certificate should be able to authenticate with LXD.\n\nWe have discovered that if a client that sends a non-CA signed certificate during the TLS handshake, that client is able to authenticate with LXD if their certificate is present in the trust store.\n- The LXD Go client (and by extension `lxc`) does not send non-CA signed certificates during the handshake.\n- A manual client (e.g. `cURL`) might send a non-CA signed certificate during the handshake.",
