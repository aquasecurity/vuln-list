  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24030",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/envoyproxy/gateway",
  "Title": "Envoy Admin Interface Exposed through prometheus metrics endpoint",
  "Description": "A user with access to a Kubernetes cluster where Envoy Gateway is installed can use a path traversal attack to execute Envoy Admin interface commands on proxies managed by Envoy Gateway. The admin interface can be used to terminate the Envoy process and extract the Envoy configuration (possibly containing confidential data).\n\nFor example, the following command, if run from within the Kubernetes cluster, can be used to get the configuration dump of the proxy:\n```\ncurl --path-as-is http://\u003cProxy-Service-ClusterIP\u003e:19001/stats/prometheus/../../config_dump\n```",
