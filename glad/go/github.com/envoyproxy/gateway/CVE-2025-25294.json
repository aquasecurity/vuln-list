  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-25294",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/envoyproxy/gateway",
  "Title": "Envoy Gateway Log Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "In all Envoy Gateway versions prior to 1.2.7 and 1.3.1 a default Envoy Proxy access log configuration is used. This format is vulnerable to log injection attacks.\n\nIf the attacker uses a specially crafted user-agent which performs json injection, then he could add and overwrite fields to the access log.\n\nExamples of attacks include:\n\n-  Using following string as user agent : `HELLO-WORLD\", \"evil-ip\": \"1.1.1.1\", \"x-forwarded-for\": \"1.1.1.1` would lead to setting of new access log properties and overwrite of existing properties. Existing properties such as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header may have importance for security analysis of access logs, and their overwrite can be used to hide malicious activity.\n\n- Using the following string as user-agent : `\"` which renders an invalid json document. The invalid document may fail to be processed by observability solutions, which would allow attacker to hide malicious activity.",
