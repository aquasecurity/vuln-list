  "Title": "OpenTofu incorrectly validates excluded subdomain constraint in conjunction with TLS certificates containing wildcard SANs",
  "Description": "When OpenTofu is acting as a TLS client authenticating a certificate chain provided by a TLS server, an excluded subdomain constraint in a certificate chain does not restrict the usage of wildcard [SANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate#Subject_Alternative_Name_certificate) in the leaf certificate.\n\nFor example a constraint that excludes the subdomain test.example.com does not prevent a leaf certificate from claiming the SAN *.example.com.",
