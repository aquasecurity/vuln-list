  "Title": "btcd susceptible to consensus failures",
  "Description": "btcd before 0.24.0 does not correctly implement the consensus rules outlined in BIP 68 and BIP 112, making it susceptible to consensus failures. Specifically, it uses the transaction version as a signed integer when it is supposed to be treated as unsigned. There can be a chain split and loss of funds.",
