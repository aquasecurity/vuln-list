  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-39720",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/ollama/ollama",
  "Title": "Ollama Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use two HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation).",
