  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-52522",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/rclone/rclone",
  "Title": "Rclone has Improper Permission and Ownership Handling on Symlink Targets with --links and --metadata",
  "Description": "Insecure handling of symlinks with `--links` and `--metadata` in rclone while copying to local disk allows unprivileged users to indirectly modify ownership and permissions on symlink target files when a superuser or privileged process performs a copy. This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files (e.g., /etc/shadow), compromising system integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\nFor instance, an unprivileged user could set a symlink to a sensitive file within their home directory, waiting for an administrator or automated process (e.g., a cron job running with elevated privileges) to copy their files with rclone using the --links and --metadata options. Upon copying, rclone will incorrectly apply chown and chmod to the symlinkâ€™s target file rather than just the symlink itself, resulting in ownership and permission changes on the sensitive file.",
