  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/go-vela/server",
  "Title": "Duplicate of ./go/github.com/go-vela/server/CVE-2022-39395.yml",
  "Description": "Some current default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and container breakouts. Running Vela plugins as privileged Docker containers allows a malicious user to easily break out of the container and gain access to the worker host operating system. On a fresh install of Vela without any additional configuration, the `target/vela-docker` plugin will run as a privileged container, even if the Vela administrators did not intend to allow for any privileged plugins, and even if the vela.yml configuration file does not use the `privileged = True` flag. Privileged containers permit trivial breakouts, which can pose significant risk to the environment in which Vela is running.",
