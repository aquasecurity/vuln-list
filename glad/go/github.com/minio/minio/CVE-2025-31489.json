  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-31489",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/minio/minio",
  "Title": "MinIO performs incomplete signature validation for unsigned-trailer uploads",
  "Description": "This is a high priority vulnerability and users must upgrade ASAP.\n\nThe signature component of the authorization may be invalid, which would mean that as a client you can use any arbitrary secret to upload objects given the user already has prior WRITE permissions on the bucket,\n\nPrior knowledge of access-key, and bucket name this user might have access to - and an access-key with a WRITE permissions is necessary.\n\nHowever with relevant information in place, uploading random objects to buckets is trivial and easy via `curl`",
