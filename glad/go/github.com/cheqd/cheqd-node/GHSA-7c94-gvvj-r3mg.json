  "Description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability affects the [`ibc-go` package for those running full nodes, dubbed \"Huckleberry\"](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-huckleberry/10731). According to their advisory:\n\n\u003e This issue is low-severity in general, and it has a low impact and likelihood of exploitation. Depending on how a full node is architected, this issue could potentially yield a high or critical severity vulnerability.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the DID/resource modules for cheqd-node.\n\n### Patches\nNode operators are requested to upgrade to [cheqd-node v1.4.2](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v1.4.2). This is a non-state breaking release, and does not require a coordinated upgrade across all node operators.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo. Node operators are recommended to upgrade to the latest release version.\n\n### References\n- [\"Huckleberry\" IBC security advisory](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-huckleberry/10731)\n- [`ibc-go` v6.1.1 release notes](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v6.1.1)\n",
