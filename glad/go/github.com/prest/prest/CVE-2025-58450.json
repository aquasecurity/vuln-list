  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/prest/prest",
  "Title": "pREST has a Systemic SQL Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "pREST provides a simple way for users to expose access their database via a REST-full API. The project is implemented using the Go programming language and is designed to expose access to Postgres database tables.\n\nDuring an independent review of the project, Doyensec engineers found that SQL injection is a systemic problem in the current implementation (version `v2.0.0-rc2`). Even though there are several instances of attempts to sanitize user input and mitigate injection attempts, we have found that on most code-paths, the protection is faulty or non-existent.",
