  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24806",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/authelia/authelia/v4",
  "Title": "Authelia applies regulation separately to Username-based logins to Email-based logins",
  "Description": "If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force.",
