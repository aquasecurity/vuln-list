  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15136",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd",
  "Title": "Improper Authentication",
  "Description": "In etcd, gateway TLS authentication is only applied to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the `--endpoints` flag. This has been fixed with improved documentation and deprecation of the functionality.",
