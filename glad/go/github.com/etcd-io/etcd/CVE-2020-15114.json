  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "The etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.",
