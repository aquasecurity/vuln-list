  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15113",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/etcd-io/etcd",
  "Title": "Improper Preservation of Permissions",
  "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, certain directory paths are created (etcd data directory and the directory path when provided to automatically generate self-signed certificates for TLS connections with clients) with restricted access permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll. This function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory path exists already. A possible workaround is to ensure the directories have the desired permission (700).",
