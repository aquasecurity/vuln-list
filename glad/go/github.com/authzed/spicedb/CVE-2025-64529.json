  "Title": "SpiceDB WriteRelationships fails silently if payload is too big",
  "Description": "Users who:\n1. Use the exclusion operator somewhere in their authorization schema.\n1. Have configured their SpiceDB server such that `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` is bigger than 6500.\n1. Issue calls to WriteRelationships with a large enough number of updates that cause the payload to be bigger than what their datastore allows.\n\nUsers will:\n\n1. Receive a successful response from their `WriteRelationships` call, when in reality that call failed.\n2. Receive incorrect permission check results, if those relationships had to be read to resolve the relation involving the exclusion.",
