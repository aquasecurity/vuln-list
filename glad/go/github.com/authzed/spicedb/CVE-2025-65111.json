  "Title": "SpiceDB: LookupResources with Multiple Entrypoints across Different Definitions Can Return Incomplete Results",
  "Description": "If a schema includes the following characteristics:\n\n1. Permission defined in terms of a union (`+`)\n1. That union references the same relation on both sides, but one side arrows to a different permission\n\nThen you might have missing `LookupResources` results when checking the permission. This only affects `LookupResources`; other APIs calculate permissionship correctly.\n\nA small concrete example:\n\n```\nrelation doer_of_things: user | group#member\npermission do_the_thing = doer_of_things + doer_of_things-\u003eadmin\n```\n\nA CheckPermission on `do_the_thing` will return the correct permissionship, but a LookupResources on `do_the_thing` may miss resources.",
