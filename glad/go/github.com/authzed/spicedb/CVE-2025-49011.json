  "Title": "SpiceDB checks involving relations with caveats can result in no permission when permission is expected",
  "Description": "On schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrowâ€™ed relation, when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated branches, requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected.\n\nFor example, given this schema:\n\n```\ndefinition user {}\n\ndefinition office {\nrelation parent: office\nrelation manager: user\npermission read = manager + parent-\u003eread\n}\n\ndefinition group {\nrelation parent: office\npermission read = parent-\u003eread\n}\n\ndefinition document {\nrelation owner: group with equals\npermission read = owner-\u003eread\n}\n\ncaveat equals(actual string, required string) {\nactual == required\n}\n```\n\nand these relationships:\n\n``` \noffice:headoffice#manager@user:maria\noffice:branch1#parent@office:headoffice \ngroup:admins#parent@office:branch1\ngroup:managers#parent@office:headoffice \ndocument:budget#owner@group:admins[equals:{\"required\":\"admin\"}] \ndocument:budget#owner@group:managers[equals:{\"required\":\"manager\"}]\n```\n\nPermission for `'document:budget#read@user:maria with {\"actual\" : \"admin\"}'` is returned as NO_PERMISSION when HAS_PERMISSION is the correct answer.",
