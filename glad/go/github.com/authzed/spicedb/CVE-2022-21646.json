  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-21646",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/authzed/spicedb",
  "Title": "Lookup operations do not take into account wildcards in SpiceDB",
  "Description": "SpiceDB is a database system for managing security-critical application permissions. Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as \"accessible\" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.",
