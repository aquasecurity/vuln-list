  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-21496",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/greenpau/caddy-security",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
  "Description": "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to improper input sanitization. Although the Referer header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [\u0026], [\u003c], [\u003e], [\"], [']), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)// payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the target userâ€™s browser, compromising user sessions.",
