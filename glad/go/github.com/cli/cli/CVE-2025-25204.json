  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-25204",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cli/cli",
  "Title": "`gh attestation verify` returns incorrect exit code during verification if no attestations are present",
  "Description": "A bug in GitHub's Artifact Attestation CLI tool, `gh attestation verify`, may return an incorrect zero exit status when no matching attestations are found for the specified `--predicate-type \u003cvalue\u003e` or the default `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1` if not specified. This issue only arises if an artifact has an attestation with a predicate type different from the one provided in the command. As a result, users relying solely on these exit codes may mistakenly believe the attestation has been verified, despite the absence of an attestation with the specified predicate type and the tool printing a verification failure.\n\nUsers are advised to update `gh` to version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.\n\nInitial report: https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10418\nFix: https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10421",
