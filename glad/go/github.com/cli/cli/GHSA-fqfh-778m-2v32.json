  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')",
  "Description": "GitHub CLI depends on a git.exe executable being found in system %PATH% on Windows. However, if a malicious `.\\git.exe` or `.\\git.bat` is found in the current working directory at the time of running gh, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one. Windows users who run gh inside untrusted directories are affected.",
