  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-18466",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/containers/podman",
  "Title": "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Podman in libpod before 1.6.0. It resolves a symlink in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host, because an undesired glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host.",
