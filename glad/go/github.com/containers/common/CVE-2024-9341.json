  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-9341",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/containers/common",
  "Title": "Link Following in github.com/containers/common",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system.",
