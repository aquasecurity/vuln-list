  "Title": "ibc-go: Potential Reentrancy using Timeout Callbacks in ibc-hooks",
  "Description": "Through the deployment and subsequent use of a malicious CosmWasm contract via IBC interactions, an attacker could potentially execute the same `MsgTimeout` inside the IBC hook for the `OnTimeout` callback before the packet commitment is deleted. On chains where ibc-hooks wraps ICS-20, this vulnerability may allow for the logic of the `OnTimeout` callback of the transfer application to be recursively executed, leading to a condition that may present the opportunity for the loss of funds from the escrow account or unexpected minting of tokens.",
