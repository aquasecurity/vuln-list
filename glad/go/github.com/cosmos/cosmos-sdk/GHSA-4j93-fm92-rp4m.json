  "Description": "## ASA-2024-003: Missing `BlockedAddressed` Validation in Vesting Module\n\n**Component**: Cosmos SDK\n**Criticality**: Low\n**Affected Versions**: Cosmos SDK versions \u003c= 0.50.3; \u003c= 0.47.8\n**Affected Users**: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators\n**Impact**: Denial of Service\n\n## Description\n\nA vulnerability was identified in the `x/auth/vesting` module, which can allow a user to create a periodic vesting account on a blocked address, for example a non-initialized module account. Additional validation was added to prevent creation of a periodic vesting account in this scenario.\n\nIf this case is triggered, there is the potential for a chain halt if the uninitialized account in question is called by `GetModuleAccount` in `Begin`/`EndBlock` of a module. This combination of an uninitialized blocked module account is not common. \n\n## Next Steps for Impacted Parties\n\nIf your chain has uninitialized blocked module accounts, it is recommended to proactively initialize them, as they are often initialized during a chain migration or during init genesis.\n\nIf you are a chain developer on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update to the latest available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project. Once a patched version is available, it is recommended that network operators upgrade.\n\nA Github Security Advisory for this issue is available in the Cosmos-SDK [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories). For more information about Cosmos SDK, see https://docs.cosmos.network/.\n\nThis issue was found by [Dongsam](https://github.com/dongsam) who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 30, 2024.
