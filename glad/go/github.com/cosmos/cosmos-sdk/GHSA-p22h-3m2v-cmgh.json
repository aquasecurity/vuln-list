  "Title": "Cosmos SDK's Integer Overflow vulnerability in its Validator Rewards pool can cause a chain halt",
  "Description": "Description\nName: ISA-2025-005: Integer Overflow in Cosmos SDK\nComponent: CosmosSDK\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: \u003c= v0.50.13, \u003c= 0.53.2\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, Users on chains that utilize the distribution module\nCosmos SDK chains in unpatched releases that use the x/distribution module are affected.\n\nDescription\nAn issue was discovered in the distribution module where a malicious deposit into the Validator Rewards pool would result in an integer overflow that would cause a chain halt. A malicious validator can interact with the distribution module to introduce this state.\n\nPatches\nHas the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?\n\nThe new Cosmos SDK release [v0.50.14](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.14) and [v0.53.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.53.3) fix this issue.\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. It is advised that chains apply the update.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by `myte1111111` on HackerOne on April 15, 2025.
