  "Title": "Cosmos EVM Allows Partial Precompile State Writes",
  "Description": "Setting lower EVM call gas allows users to partially execute precompiles and error at specific points in the precompile code without reverting the partially written state.\n\nIf executed on the distribution precompile when claiming funds, it could cause funds to be transferred to a user without resetting the claimable rewards to 0. The vulnerability could also be used to cause indeterministic execution by failing at other points in the code, halting validators.\n\nAny evmOS or Cosmos EVM chain using precompiles is affected.",
