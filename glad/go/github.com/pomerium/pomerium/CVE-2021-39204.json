  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-39204",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/pomerium/pomerium",
  "Title": "Excessive Iteration",
  "Description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, incorrectly handles resetting of HTTP/2 streams with excessive complexity. This can lead to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. This can result in a DoS condition. Pomerium versions 0.14.8 and 0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched.",
