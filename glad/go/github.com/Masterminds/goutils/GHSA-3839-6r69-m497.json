  "Title": "Duplicate Advisory: GoUtils's randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected",
  "Description": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-xg2h-wx96-xgxr. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nRandomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The `RandomAlphaNumeric` and `CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric` functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.",
