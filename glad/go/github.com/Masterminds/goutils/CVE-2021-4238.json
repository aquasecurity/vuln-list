  "Title": "RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric are not as random as they should be",
  "Description": "A security-sensitive bug was discovered by Open Source Developer *Erik Sundell of Sundell Open Source Consulting AB*.\n\nThe functions `RandomAlphaNumeric(int)` and `CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric(int)` are not as random as they should be. Small values of `int` in the functions above will return a smaller subset of results than they should. For example, `RandomAlphaNumeric(1)` will always return a digit in the 0-9 range, while `RandomAlphaNumeric(4)` will return around ~7 million of the ~13M possible permutations.\n\nThis is considered a security release because programs that rely upon random generators for passwords are at an increased risk of brute force-style password guessing. There is also a higher probability of collision.\n\nThe problem was the result of a mistaken regular expression that only accepted random strings if they contained a digit from `[0-9]`. That restriction has been removed.",
