  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-47950",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/coredns/coredns",
  "Title": "CoreDNS Vulnerable to DoQ Memory Exhaustion via Stream Amplification",
  "Description": "A **Denial of Service (DoS)** vulnerability was discovered in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash â€” especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments.",
