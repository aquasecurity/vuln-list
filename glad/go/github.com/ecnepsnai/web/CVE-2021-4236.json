  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/ecnepsnai/web",
  "Title": "Websocket requests did not call AuthenticateMethod",
  "Description": "Depending on implementation, a denial-of-service or privilege escalation vulnerability may occur in software that uses the `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` package with Web Sockets that have an AuthenticateMethod.\n\nThe `AuthenticateMethod` is not called, and `UserData` will be nil in request methods. Attempts to read the `UserData` may result in a panic.\n\nThis issue only affects web sockets where an `AuthenticateMethod` is supplied to the handle options. Users who do not use web sockets, or users who do not require authentication are not at risk.",
