  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-35192",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/aquasecurity/trivy",
  "Title": "Trivy possibly leaks registry credential when scanning images from malicious registries",
  "Description": "If a malicious actor is able to trigger Trivy to scan container images from a crafted malicious registry, it could result in the leakage of credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR). These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access.\n\nTaking AWS as an example, the leakage only occurs when Trivy is able to transparently obtain registry credentials from the default [credential provider chain](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials). You are affected if Trivy is executed in any of the following situations:\n\n- The environment variables contain static AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN) that have access to ECR.\n- Within a Pod running on an EKS cluster that has been assigned a role with access to ECR using an [IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) (IRSA) annotation.\n- etc.\n\nYou are not affected if the default credential provider chain is unable to obtain valid credentials. The same applies to GCP and Azure.",
