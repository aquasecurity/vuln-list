  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15091",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/tendermint/tendermint",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature",
  "Description": "TenderMint from version 0.33.0 and before version 0.33.6 allows block proposers to include signatures for the wrong block. This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing chainID**). A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6 which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before creating a commit.",
