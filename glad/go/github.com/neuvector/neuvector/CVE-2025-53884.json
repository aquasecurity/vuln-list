  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-53884",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/neuvector/neuvector",
  "Title": "NeuVector has an  insecure password storage vulnerable to rainbow attack",
  "Description": "NeuVector stores user passwords and API keys using a simple, unsalted hash. This method is vulnerable to rainbow table attack (offline attack where hashes of known passwords are precomputed).\n\nNeuVector generates a cryptographically secure, random 16-character salt and uses it with the PBKDF2 algorithm to create the hash value for the following actions:\n\n- Creating a user\n- Updating a userâ€™s password\n- Creating an API key\n\n**Note:** After upgrading to NeuVector 5.4.6, users must log in again so that NeuVector can regenerate the password hash. For API keys, you must send at least one request per API key to regenerate its hash value.",
