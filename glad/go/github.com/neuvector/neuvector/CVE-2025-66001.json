  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66001",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/neuvector/neuvector",
  "Title": "NeuVector OpenID Connect is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM)",
  "Description": "NeuVector supports login authentication through OpenID Connect. However, the TLS verification (which verifies the remote server's authenticity and integrity) for OpenID Connect is not enforced by default. As a result this may expose the system to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\nStarting from version 5.4.0, NeuVector supports TLS verification for following connection types:\n\n- Registry Connections\n- Auth Server Connections (SAML, LDAP and OIDC)\n- Webhook Connections\n\nBy default, TLS verification remains disabled, and its configuration is located under **Settings \u003e Configuration in the NeuVector UI**.\n\nIn the patched version, the new NeuVector deployment enables TLS verification by default.\nFor rolling upgrades, NeuVector does not automatically change this setting to prevent disruptions.\n\n**Note:** When \"TLS verification\" is enabled, it affects all connections to:\n\n- Registry servers\n- Auth servers (SAML, LDAP and OIDC)\n- Webhook servers",
