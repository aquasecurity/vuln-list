  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54470",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/neuvector/neuvector",
  "Title": "NeuVector telemetry sender is vulnerable to MITM and DoS",
  "Description": "This vulnerability affects NeuVector deployments only when the `Report anonymous cluster data option` is enabled. When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server at `https://upgrades.neuvector-upgrade-responder.livestock.rancher.io`.\n\nIn affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS certificate verification when transmitting anonymous cluster data to the telemetry server. As a result, the communication channel is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept or modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector loads the response of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size limitation, which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS) attack.\n\nThe patched version includes the following security improvements:\n- NeuVector now verifies the telemetry server’s `TLS certificate chain` and `hostname` during the handshake process. This ensures that all telemetry communications occur over a trusted and verified channel.\n- NeuVector limits the telemetry server’s response to `256 bytes`, mitigating the risk of memory exhaustion and DoS attacks.\n\nThese security enhancements are enabled by default and require no user action.",
