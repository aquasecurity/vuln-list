  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/docker/compose/v2",
  "Title": "Docker Compose Vulnerable to Path Traversal via OCI Artifact Layer Annotations",

When a layer includes the annotations com.docker.compose.extends or com.docker.compose.envfile, Compose joins the attacker‑supplied value from com.docker.compose.file/com.docker.compose.envfile with its local cache directory and writes the file there.",
