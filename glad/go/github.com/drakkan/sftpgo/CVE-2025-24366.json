  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24366",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/drakkan/sftpgo",
  "Title": "SFTPGo has insufficient sanitization of user provided rsync command",
  "Description": "SFTPGo supports execution of a defined set of commands via SSH. Besides a set of default commands some optional commands can be activated, one of them being `rsync`: it is disabled in the default configuration and it is limited to the local filesystem, it does not work with cloud/remote storage backends.\n\nDue to missing sanitization of the client provided `rsync` command, an authenticated remote user can use some options of the rsync command to read or write files with the permissions of the SFTPGo server process.",
