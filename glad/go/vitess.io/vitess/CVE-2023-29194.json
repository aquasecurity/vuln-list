  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-29194",
  "PackageSlug": "go/vitess.io/vitess",
  "Title": "vitess allows users to create keyspaces that can deny access to already existing keyspaces",
  "Description": "### Impact\nUsers can either intentionally or inadvertently create a keyspace containing `/` characters such that from that point on, anyone who tries to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error. Trying to list all the keyspaces using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces` will also return an error.\nNote that all other keyspaces can still be administered using the CLI (vtctldclient).\n\n### Patches\nv16.0.1 (corresponding to 0.16.1 on pkg.go.dev)\n\n### Workarounds\nDelete the offending keyspace using a CLI client (vtctldclient) \n```\nvtctldclient --server ... DeleteKeyspace a/b\n```\n\nFound during a security audit sponsored by the [CNCF](https://cncf.io) and facilitated by [OSTIF](https://ostif.org).",
