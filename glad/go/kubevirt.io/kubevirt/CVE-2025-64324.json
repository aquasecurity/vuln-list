  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64324",
  "PackageSlug": "go/kubevirt.io/kubevirt",
  "Title": "KubeVirt Vulnerable to Arbitrary Host File Read and Write",
  "Description": "The `hostDisk` feature in KubeVirt allows mounting a host file or directory owned by the user with UID 107 into a VM. However, the implementation of this feature and more specifically the `DiskOrCreate` option which creates a file if it doesn't exist, has a logic bug that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files owned by more privileged users on the host system.",
