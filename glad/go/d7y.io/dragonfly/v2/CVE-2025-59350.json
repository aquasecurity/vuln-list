  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59350",
  "PackageSlug": "go/d7y.io/dragonfly/v2",
  "Title": "Dragonfly vulnerable to timing attacks against Proxy’s basic authentication",
  "Description": "The access control mechanism for the Proxy feature uses simple string comparisons and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker may try to guess the password one character at a time by sending all possible characters to a vulnerable mechanism and measuring the comparison instruction’s execution times.\nThe vulnerability is shown in figure 8.1, where both the username and password are compared with a short-circuiting equality operation.\n\n```golang\nif user != proxy.basicAuth.Username || pass != proxy.basicAuth.Password {\n```\n\nIt is currently undetermined what an attacker may be able to do with access to the proxy password.",
