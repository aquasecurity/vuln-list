  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-8557",
  "PackageSlug": "go/k8s.io/kubernetes",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "The Kubernetes kubelet component do not account for disk usage by a pod which writes to its own `/etc/hosts` file. The `/etc/hosts` file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod writes a large amount of data to the `/etc/hosts` file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.",
