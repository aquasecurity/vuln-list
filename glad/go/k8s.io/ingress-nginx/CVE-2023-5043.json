  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-5043",
  "PackageSlug": "go/k8s.io/ingress-nginx",
  "Title": "Ingress nginx annotation injection causes arbitrary command execution",
  "Description": "### Issue Details\nA security issue was identified in ingress-nginx where the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet annotation on an Ingress object (in the networking.k8s.io or extensions API group) can be used to inject arbitrary commands, and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all secrets in the cluster.\n\nThis issue has been rated High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L), and assigned CVE-2023-5043.\n\n### Affected Components and Configurations\nThis bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running kubectl get po -n ingress-nginx.\n\nIf you are running the “chrooted” ingress-nginx controller introduced in v1.2.0 (gcr.io/k8s-staging-ingress-nginx/controller-chroot), command execution is possible but credential extraction is not, so the High severity does not apply.\n\nMulti-tenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n\u003cv1.9.0\n#### Versions allowing mitigation\nv1.9.0\n### Mitigation\nIngress Administrators should set the --enable-annotation-validation flag to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields.\n\n### Detection\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io\n\n### Additional Details\nSee ingress-nginx Issue [#10571](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/10571) for more details.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThis vulnerability was reported by suanve\n\nThank You,\nCJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee",
