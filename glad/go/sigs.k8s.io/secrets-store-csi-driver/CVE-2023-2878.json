  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-2878",
  "PackageSlug": "go/sigs.k8s.io/secrets-store-csi-driver",
  "Title": "secrets-store-csi-driver discloses service account tokens in logs",
  "Description": "A security issue was discovered in secrets-store-csi-driver where an actor with access to the driver logs could observe service account tokens. These tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions. Tokens are only logged when [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.\n\n\nThis issue has been rated MEDIUM [. and assigned CVE-2023-2878\n\n\n### Am I vulnerable?\n\nYou may be vulnerable if [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.\n\n\nTo check if token requests are configured, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get csidriver secrets-store.csi.k8s.io -o jsonpath=\"{.spec.tokenRequests}\"\n```\n\nTo check if tokens are being logged, examine the secrets-store container log:\n\n```bash\nkubectl logs -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver -c secrets-store -f | grep --line-buffered \"csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens\"\n```\n\n### Affected Versions\n\n- secrets-store-csi-driver \u003c 1.3.3\n\n\n### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?\n\nPrior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by running secrets-store-csi-driver at log level 0 or 1 via the -v flag.\n\n\n### Fixed Versions\n\n\n- secrets-store-csi-driver \u003e= 1.3.3\n\n\nTo upgrade, refer to the documentation: https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/upgrades.html#upgrades\n\n\n### Detection\n\n\nExamine cloud provider logs for unexpected token exchanges, as well as unexpected access to cloud vault secrets.\n\n\nIf you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact [security@kubernetes.io](https://groups.google.com/)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Tomer Shaiman @tshaiman from Microsoft.",
