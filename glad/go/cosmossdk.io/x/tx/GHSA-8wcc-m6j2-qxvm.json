  "Title": "CosmosSDK: Transaction decoding may result in a stack overflow or resource exhaustion ",
  "Description": "### ASA-2024-0012: Transaction decoding may result in a stack overflow\nWhen decoding a maliciously formed packet with a deeply-nested structure, it may be possible for a stack overflow to occur and result in a network halt. This was addressed by adding a recursion limit while decoding the packet.\n### ASA-2024-0013: Transaction decoding may result in resource exhaustion\nNested messages in a transaction can consume exponential cpu and memory on `UnpackAny` calls. The `max_tx_bytes` sets a limit for external TX but is not applied for internal messages emitted by wasm contracts or a malicious validator block. This may result in a node crashing due to resource exhaustion. This was addressed by adding additional validation to prevent this condition.",
