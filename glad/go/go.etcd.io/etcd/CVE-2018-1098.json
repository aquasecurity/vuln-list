  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-1098",
  "PackageSlug": "go/go.etcd.io/etcd",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.",
