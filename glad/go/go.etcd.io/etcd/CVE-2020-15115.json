  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15115",
  "PackageSlug": "go/go.etcd.io/etcd",
  "Title": "Weak Password Requirements",
  "Description": "etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users' passwords with little computational effort.",
