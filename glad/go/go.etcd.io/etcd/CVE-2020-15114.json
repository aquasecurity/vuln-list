  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15114",
  "PackageSlug": "go/go.etcd.io/etcd",
  "Title": "Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime",
  "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.",
