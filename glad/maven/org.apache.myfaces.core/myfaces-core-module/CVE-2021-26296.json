  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-26296",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.myfaces.core/myfaces-core-module",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "In the default configuration, Apache MyFaces Core versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.13, 2.3.0 to 2.3.7, 2.3-next-M1 to 2.3-next-M4, and 3.0.0-RC1 use cryptographically weak implicit and explicit cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens. Due to that limitation, it is possible (although difficult) for an attacker to calculate a future CSRF token value and to use that value to trick a user into executing unwanted actions on an application.",
