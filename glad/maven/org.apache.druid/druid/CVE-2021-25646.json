  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-25646",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.druid/druid",
  "Title": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource",
  "Description": "Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript code embedded in various types of requests. This functionality is intended for use in high-trust environments, and is disabled by default. However, in Druid, it is possible for an authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request, regardless of server configuration. This can be leveraged to execute code on the target machine with the privileges of the Druid server process.",
