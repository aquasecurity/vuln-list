{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-1000106",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.jenkins.blueocean/blueocean",
  "Title": "Improper Authentication",
  "Description": "Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. Its SCM content REST API supports the pipeline creation and editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content REST API does not check the current user's authentication or credentials. If the GitHub organization folder is created via Blue Ocean, it retains a reference to its creator's GitHub credentials. This allows users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to create arbitrary commits in the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub credentials of the creator of the organization folder.",
