  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47880",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.openrefine/openrefine",
  "Title": "OpenRefine has a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) from POST request in ExportRowsCommand",
  "Description": "The `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request.\n\nAn attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine.\n\nThe attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row.",
