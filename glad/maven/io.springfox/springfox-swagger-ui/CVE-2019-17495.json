  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.springfox/springfox-swagger-ui",
  "Title": "Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "A Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) injection vulnerability in Swagger UI allows attackers to use the Relative Path Overwrite (RPO) technique to perform CSS-based input field value exfiltration, such as exfiltration of a CSRF token value. In other words, this product intentionally allows the embedding of untrusted JSON data from remote servers, but it was not previously known that `\u003cstyle\u003e@import` within the JSON data was a functional attack method.",
