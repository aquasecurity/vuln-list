  "Title": "Apache Pinot has Groovy Function support enabled by default",
  "Description": "Pinot allows you to run any function using Apache Groovy scripts. In versions prior to 0.10.0, Pinot query endpoint and realtime ingestion layer has a vulnerability in unprotected environments due to groovy function support being enabled by default. This issue has been fixed by making function support disabled by default, in version 0.11.0. A potential workaround is to disable groovy script support.",
