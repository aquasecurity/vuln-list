  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-32888",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.amazon.redshift/redshift-jdbc42",
  "Title": "Amazon JDBC Driver for Redshift SQL Injection via line comment generation",
  "Description": "SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected.",
