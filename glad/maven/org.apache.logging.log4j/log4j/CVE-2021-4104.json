  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "JMSAppender in Log4j is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide `TopicBindingName` and `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName` configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue only affects Log4j when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j reached end of life in August Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.",
