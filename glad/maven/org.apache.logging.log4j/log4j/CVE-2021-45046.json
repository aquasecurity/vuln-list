  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')",
  "Description": "It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId})` or a Thread Context Map pattern (`%X`, `%mdc`, or `%MDC`) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. Log4j fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.",
