  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-38374",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.cyclonedx/cyclonedx-core-java",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-core-java",
  "Description": "Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, _cyclonedx-core-java_ leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.\n\nXXE injection can be exploited to exfiltrate local file content, or perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access infrastructure adjacent to the vulnerable application.",
