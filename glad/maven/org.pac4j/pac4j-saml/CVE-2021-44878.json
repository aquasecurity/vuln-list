  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-44878",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.pac4j/pac4j-saml",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature",
  "Description": "Pac4j v5.1 allows (by default) clients to accept and successfully validate ID Tokens with `none` algorithm (i.e., tokens with no signature) which is not secure and violates the OpenID Core Specification. The `none` algorithm does not require any signature verification when validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using `none` as the value of `alg` key in the header with an empty signature value.",
