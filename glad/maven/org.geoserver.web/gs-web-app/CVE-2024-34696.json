  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.geoserver.web/gs-web-app",
  "Title": " GeoServer's Server Status shows sensitive environmental variables and Java properties",
  "Description": "GeoServer's Server Status page and REST API (at `/geoserver/rest/about/status`) lists *all* environment variables and Java properties to *any* GeoServer user with administrative rights as part of those modules' status message.\n\nThese variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens, for example:\n\n* Data stores defined with [parameterized catalog settings][catalog] (`-DALLOW_ENV_PARAMETRIZATION=true`) which need a password or access key.\n\n* GeoServer's official Docker image [uses environment variables to configure PostgreSQL JNDI resources, including credentials][docker-jndi] (`POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_USERNAME`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`)\n\nAdditionally, many community-developed GeoServer container images `export` other credentials from their start-up scripts as environment variables to the GeoServer (`java`) process, such as:\n\n* GeoServer `admin` and master (`root`) passwords\n\n* Tomcat management application password\n\n* HTTPS/TLS certificate key store password\n\n* AWS S3 bucket access keys\n\nThe precise scope of the issue depends on which container image is used and how it is configured.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e Some container images allow passing secrets as files (eg: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE`), or randomly generating passwords on start-up. While this is promoted as best-practice[^secret-files], if its start-up script [`export`s these as environment variables][bash-export] to GeoServer, they are **also** impacted by this issue.\n\n[bash-export]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#index-export\n[catalog]: https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/datadirectory/configtemplate.html\n[docker-jndi]: https://github.com/geoserver/docker/blob/master/README.md#how-to-enable-a-postgresql-jndi-resource",
