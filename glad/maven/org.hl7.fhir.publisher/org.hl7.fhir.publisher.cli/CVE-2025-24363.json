  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24363",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.hl7.fhir.publisher/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.cli",
  "Title": "HL7 FHIR IG Publisher potentially exposes GitHub repo user and credential information",
  "Description": "In CI contexts, the IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine the URL of the originating repo. If the repo was cloned, or otherwise set to use a repo that uses a username and credential based URL, the entire URL will be included in the built Implementation Guide, exposing username and credential. This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure.",
