  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-48459",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.iotdb/iotdb-confignode",
  "Title": "Apache IoTDB: Deserialization of untrusted Data",
  "Description": "Apache IoTDB deserializes data from external inputs without sufficient validation, allowing attacker-controlled serialized objects to be processed. In environments where a compatible gadget chain is reachable, this can be abused to execute arbitrary code or alter server state; at minimum it enables high-impact integrity and confidentiality compromise on the IoTDB process.",
