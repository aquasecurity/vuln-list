  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.elasticsearch/elasticsearch",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference",
  "Description": "Elasticsearch Security versions 6.5.0 and 6.5.1 contain an XXE flaw in Machine Learning's find_file_structure API. If a policy allowing external network access has been added to Elasticsearch's Java Security Manager then an attacker could send a specially crafted request capable of leaking content of local files on the Elasticsearch node. This could allow a user to access information that they should not have access to.",
