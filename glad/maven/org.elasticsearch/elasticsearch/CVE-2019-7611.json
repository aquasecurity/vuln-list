  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-7611",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.elasticsearch/elasticsearch",
  "Title": "Improper Access Control in Elasticsearch",
  "Description": "A permission issue was found in Elasticsearch versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 when Field Level Security and Document Level Security are disabled and the _aliases, _shrink, or _split endpoints are used . If the elasticsearch.yml file has xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled set to false, certain permission checks are skipped when users perform one of the actions mentioned above, to make existing data available under a new index/alias name. This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.",
