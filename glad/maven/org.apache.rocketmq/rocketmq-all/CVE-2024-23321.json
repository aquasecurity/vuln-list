  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23321",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.rocketmq/rocketmq-all",
  "Title": "Apache RocketMQ Vulnerable to Unauthorized Exposure of Sensitive Data",
  "Description": "For RocketMQ versions 5.2.0 and below, under certain conditions, there is a risk of exposure of sensitive Information to an unauthorized actor even if RocketMQ is enabled with authentication and authorization functions.\n\nAn attacker, possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP allowlist, could potentially acquire the administrator's account and password through specific interfaces. Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list.\n\nTo mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0.",
