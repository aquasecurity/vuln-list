  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26259",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream",
  "Title": "OS Command Injection",
  "Description": "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary known files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with an allow list. Anyone relying on XStream's default block list can immediately switch to an allow list for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability.",
