  "Title": "Jenkins is missing a permission check in the authenticated users' profile menu ",
  "Description": "Jenkins 2.527 and earlier, LTS 2.516.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check for the authenticated user profile dropdown menu. This allows attackers without Overall/Read permission to obtain limited information about the Jenkins configuration by listing available options in this menu (e.g., whether Credentials Plugin is installed).\n\nJenkins 2.528, LTS 2.516.3 requires Overall/Read permission to list various items in authenticated user profile dropdown menus.",
