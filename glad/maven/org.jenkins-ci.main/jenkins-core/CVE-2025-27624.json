  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27624",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.main/jenkins-core",
  "Title": "Jenkins cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability",
  "Description": "Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint toggling collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets (e.g., Build Queue and Build Executor Status widgets), resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to have users toggle their collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets.\n\nAdditionally, as the API accepts any string as the identifier of the panel ID to be toggled, attacker-controlled content can be stored in the victimâ€™s user profile in Jenkins.\n\nJenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.",
