  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27625",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.main/jenkins-core",
  "Title": "Jenkins Open Redirect vulnerability ",
  "Description": "Various features in Jenkins redirect users to partially user-controlled URLs inside Jenkins. To prevent open redirect vulnerabilities, Jenkins limits redirections to safe URLs (neither absolute nor scheme-relative/network-path reference).\n\nIn Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier, redirects starting with backslash (`\\`) characters are considered safe.\n\nThis allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site, because browsers interpret these characters as part of scheme-relative redirects.\n\nJenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 considers redirects to URLs starting with backslash (`\\`) characters to be unsafe, rejecting such redirects.",
