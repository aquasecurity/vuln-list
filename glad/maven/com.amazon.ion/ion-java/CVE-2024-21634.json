  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.amazon.ion/ion-java",
  "Title": "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling",
  "Description": "Amazon Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in `ion-java` for applications that use `ion-java` to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the `IonValue` model and then invoke certain `IonValue` methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the `IonValue` model, results in a `StackOverflowError` originating from the `ion-java` library. The patch is included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with.",
