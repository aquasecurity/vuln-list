  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-5967",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-ldap-federation",
  "Title": "Keycloak leaks configured LDAP bind credentials through the Keycloak admin console",
  "Description": "The LDAP testing endpoint allows to change the Connection URL independently of and without having to re-enter the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. An attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) can change the LDAP host URL (\"Connection URL\") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker.\nAs a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console/compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and can now attack the domain.",
