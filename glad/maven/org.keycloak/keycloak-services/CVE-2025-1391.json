  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-1391",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services",
  "Title": "Keycloak allows Incorrect Assignment of an Organization to a User",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Keycloak organization feature, which allows the incorrect assignment of an organization to a user if their username or email matches the organizationâ€™s domain pattern. This issue occurs at the mapper level, leading to misrepresentation in tokens. If an application relies on these claims for authorization, it may incorrectly assume a user belongs to an organization they are not a member of, potentially granting unauthorized access or privileges.",
