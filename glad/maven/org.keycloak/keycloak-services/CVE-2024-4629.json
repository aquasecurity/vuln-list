  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-4629",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-services",
  "Title": "Keycloak Services has a potential bypass of brute force protection",
  "Description": "If an attacker launches many login attempts in parallel then the attacker can have more guesses at a password than the brute force protection configuration permits. This is due to the brute force check occurring before the brute force protector has locked the user.\n\n**Acknowledgements:**\nSpecial thanks to Maurizio Agazzini for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project.",
