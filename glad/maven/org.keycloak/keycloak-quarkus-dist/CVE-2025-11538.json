  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-11538",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-quarkus-dist",
  "Title": "Keycloak has debug default bind address",
  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in Keycloak's server distribution where enabling debug mode (`--debug`) insecurely defaults to binding the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) port to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). This exposes the debug port to the local network, allowing an attacker on the same network segment to attach a remote debugger and achieve remote code execution within the Keycloak Java virtual machine.\n\nRed Hat evaluates this as a Moderate impact vulnerability due to the requirement of running debug mode and untrusted network. Also, for Red Hat Single Sign-On, this must as well be bound to 0.0.0.0 address, which is not recommended in production scenarios.",
