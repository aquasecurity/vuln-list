  "Description": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-j4vq-q93m-4683. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nA flaw was found in Keycloak. The Keycloak guides recommend to not expose /admin path to the outside in case the installation is using a proxy. The issue occurs at least via ha-proxy, as it can be tricked to using relative/non-normalized paths to access the /admin application path relative to /realms which is expected to be exposed.",
