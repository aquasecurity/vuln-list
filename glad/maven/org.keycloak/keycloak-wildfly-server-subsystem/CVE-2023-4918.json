  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-4918",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.keycloak/keycloak-wildfly-server-subsystem",
  "Title": "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Keycloak package, more specifically org.keycloak.userprofile. When a user registers itself through registration flow, the \"password\" and \"password-confirm\" field from the form will occur as regular user attributes. All users and clients with proper rights and roles are able to read users attributes, allowing a malicious user with minimal access to retrieve the users passwords in clear text, jeopardizing their environment.",
