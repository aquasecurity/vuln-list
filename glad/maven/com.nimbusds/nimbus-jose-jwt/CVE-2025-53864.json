  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.nimbusds/nimbus-jose-jwt",
  "Title": "Nimbus JOSE + JWT is vulnerable to DoS attacks when processing deeply nested JSON",
  "Description": "Connect2id Nimbus JOSE + JWT before 10.0.2 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a deeply nested JSON object supplied in a JWT claim set, because of uncontrolled recursion. NOTE: this is independent of the Gson 2.11.0 issue because the Connect2id product could have checked the JSON object nesting depth, regardless of what limits (if any) were imposed by Gson.",
