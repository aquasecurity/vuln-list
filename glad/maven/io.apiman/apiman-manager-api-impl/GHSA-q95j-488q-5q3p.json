  "Title": "Apiman Manager API affected by Jackson denial of service vulnerability",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nDue to a vulnerability in `jackson-databind \u003c= 2.12.6.0`, an authenticated attacker could craft an Apiman policy configuration which, when saved, may cause a denial of service on the Apiman Manager API.\n\nThis does **not** affect the Apiman Gateway.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Apiman 3.0.0.Final or later.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Apiman and need to remain on that version, contact your Apiman [support provider](https://www.apiman.io/support.html) for advice/long-term support.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf all users of the Apiman Manager are trusted then you may assess this is low risk, as an account is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\n* Apiman maintainer and security contact: marc@blackparrotlabs.io\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36518\n* https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2816",
