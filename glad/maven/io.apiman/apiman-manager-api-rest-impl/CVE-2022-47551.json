  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-47551",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.apiman/apiman-manager-api-rest-impl",
  "Title": "Apiman has insufficient checks for read permissions",
  "Description": "Apiman 1.5.7 through 2.2.3.Final has insufficient checks for read permissions within the Apiman Manager REST API. The root cause of the issue is the Apiman project's accidental acceptance of a large contribution that was not fully compatible with the security model of Apiman versions before 3.0.0.Final. Because of this, 3.0.0.Final is not affected by the vulnerability.",
