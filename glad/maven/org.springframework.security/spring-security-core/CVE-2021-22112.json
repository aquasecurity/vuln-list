  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-22112",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.springframework.security/spring-security-core",
  "Title": "Privilege Escalation",
  "Description": "Spring Security can fail to save the `SecurityContext` if it is changed more than once in a single request. A malicious user cannot cause the bug to happen (it must be programmed in). However, if the application's intent is to only allow the user to run with elevated privileges in a small portion of the application, the bug can be leveraged to extend those privileges to the rest of the application.",
