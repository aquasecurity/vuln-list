  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-13955",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.calcite/calcite-core",
  "Title": "Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
  "Description": "`HttpUtils#getURLConnection` method disables explicitly hostname verification for HTTPS connections making clients vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Calcite uses internally this method to connect with Druid and Splunk so information leakage may happen when using the respective Calcite adapters. The method itself is in a utility class so people may use it to create vulnerable HTTPS connections for other applications. From Apache Calcite onwards, the hostname verification will be performed using the default JVM truststore.",
