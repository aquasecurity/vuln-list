  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-1196",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot",
  "Title": "Symlink privilege escalation attack via Spring Boot launch script",
  "Description": "Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with Spring Boot is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the `run_user` to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the `run_user` requires shell access to the server.",
