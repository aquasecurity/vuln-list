  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29441",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.alibaba.nacos/nacos-api",
  "Title": "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing",
  "Description": "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. In Nacos, when configured to use authentication `-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true` it uses the `AuthFilter` servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server.",
