  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-7678",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.11",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "It is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.",
