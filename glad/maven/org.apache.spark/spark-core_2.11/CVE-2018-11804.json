  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-11804",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.11",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation in Apache Spark",
  "Description": "Spark's Apache Maven-based build includes a convenience script, 'build/mvn', that downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included in release branches since 1.3.x, up to and including master. This server will accept connections from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account running the build. **Note that this issue does not affect end users of Spark, only developers building Spark from source code.**",
