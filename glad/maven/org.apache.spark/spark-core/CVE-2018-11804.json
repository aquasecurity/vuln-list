  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "The Apache Spark Maven-based build includes a convenience script, `build/mvn`, that downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included in release branches since, up to and including master. This server will accept connections from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account running the build.",
