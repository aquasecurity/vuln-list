  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-22946",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.13",
  "Title": "Improper Privilege Management",
  "Description": "In Apache Spark versions prior to 3.4.0, applications using spark-submit can specify a 'proxy-user' to run as, limiting privileges. The application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user, however, by providing malicious configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects architectures relying on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.\n\nUpdate to Apache Spark 3.4.0 or later, and ensure that \nspark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its \ndefault of \"false\", and is not overridden by submitted applications.\n\n\n",
