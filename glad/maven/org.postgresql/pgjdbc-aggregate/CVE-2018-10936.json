  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-10936",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.postgresql/pgjdbc-aggregate",
  "Title": "Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch",
  "Description": "A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.",
