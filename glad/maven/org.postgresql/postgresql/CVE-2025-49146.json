  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-49146",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.postgresql/postgresql",
  "Title": "pgjdbc Client Allows Fallback to Insecure Authentication Despite channelBinding=require Configuration",
  "Description": "When the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is configured with channel binding set to `required` (default value is `prefer`), the driver would incorrectly allow connections to proceed with authentication methods that do not support channel binding (such as password, MD5, GSS, or SSPI  authentication). This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept connections that users believed were protected by channel binding requirements.",
