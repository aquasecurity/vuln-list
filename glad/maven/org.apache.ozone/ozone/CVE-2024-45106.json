This is only possible if:\n*  ozone.s3g.secret.http.enabled is set to true. The default value of this configuration is false.\n*  The user configured in ozone.s3g.kerberos.principal is also configured in ozone.s3.administrators or ozone.administrators.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache Ozone version 1.4.1 which disables the affected endpoint.",
