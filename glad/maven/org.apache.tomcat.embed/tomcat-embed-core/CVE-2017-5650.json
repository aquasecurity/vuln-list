  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-5650",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.tomcat.embed/tomcat-embed-core",
  "Title": "Improper Resource Shutdown or Release",
  "Description": "The handling of an HTTP/2 `GOAWAY` frame for a connection did not close streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a `WINDOW_UPDATE` before allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.",
