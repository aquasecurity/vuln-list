  "Title": "Apache Tomcat Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability",
  "Description": "Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nWhen recycling various internal objects in Apache Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.80 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93, an error could cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process leading to information leaking from the current request/response to the next.  Older, EOL versions may also be affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.",
