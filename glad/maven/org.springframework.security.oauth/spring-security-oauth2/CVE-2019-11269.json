  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-11269",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.springframework.security.oauth/spring-security-oauth2",
  "Title": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (Open Redirect)",
  "Description": "Spring Security OAuth could be susceptible to an open redirector attack that can leak an authorization code. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the `redirect_uri` parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code.",
