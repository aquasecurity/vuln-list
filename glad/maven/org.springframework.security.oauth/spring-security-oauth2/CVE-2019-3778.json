  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-3778",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.springframework.security.oauth/spring-security-oauth2",
  "Title": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site",
  "Description": "Spring Security OAuth could be susceptible to an open redirector attack that can leak an authorization code. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the `redirect_uri` parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code. This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements: Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. `@EnableAuthorizationServer`) and uses the `DefaultRedirectResolver` in the `AuthorizationEndpoint`. This vulnerability does not expose applications that: Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different `RedirectResolver` implementation other than DefaultRedirectResolver, act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. `@EnableResourceServer`), act in the role of a Client only (e.g. `@EnableOAuthClient`).",
