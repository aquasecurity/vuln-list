  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-12741",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/ca.uhn.hapi.fhir/hapi-fhir",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR library. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from `ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java` via a specially crafted URL. (This module is not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.)",
