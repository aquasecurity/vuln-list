  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "In spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to 2.4.16 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.9, allowed list patterns for deserializable class\nnames were added to Spring AMQP, allowing users to lock down deserialization of\ndata in messages from untrusted sources; however by default, when no allowed\nlist was provided, all classes could be deserialized.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, an application is\nvulnerable if\n\n * the SimpleMessageConverter or SerializerMessageConverter is used\n * the user does not configure allowed list patterns\n * untrusted message originators gain permissions to write messages to the RabbitMQ\n broker to send malicious content",
