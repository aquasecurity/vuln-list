  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-26074",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.atlassian.connect/atlassian-connect-spring-boot-starter",
  "Title": "Incorrect Authorization",
  "Description": "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) from version 1.1.0 before version 2.1.3: Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions between 1.1.0 - 2.1.2 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.",
