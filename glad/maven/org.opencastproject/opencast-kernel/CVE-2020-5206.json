  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-5206",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-kernel",
  "Title": "Improper Authentication",
  "Description": "In Opencast using a `remember-me` cookie with an arbitrary username can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access. This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a `remember-me` token, assume the identity of the global system administrator and request non-public content from the search service without ever providing any proper authentication.",
