  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54380",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-kernel",
  "Title": "Opencast still publishes global system account credentials ",
  "Description": "Opencast prior to versions 17.6 would incorrectly send the hashed global system account credentials (ie: `org.opencastproject.security.digest.user` and `org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass`) when attempting to fetch mediapackage elements included in a mediapackage XML file.  A [previous CVE](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-hcxx-mp6g-6gr9) prevented many cases where the credentials were inappropriately sent, but not all.  The remainder are addressed with this patch.",
