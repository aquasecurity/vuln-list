  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-45385",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/dockerhub-notification",
  "Title": "Lack of authentication mechanism for webhook in CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin",
  "Description": "CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin provides several webhook endpoints that can be used to trigger builds when Docker images used by a job have been rebuilt.\n\nIn CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2 and earlier, these endpoints can be accessed without authentication.\n\nThis allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified repository.\n\nCloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2.1 requires a token as a part of webhook URLs, which will act as authentication for the webhook endpoint. As a result, all webhook URLs in the plugin will be different after updating the plugin.\n\nAdministrators can set the [Java system](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) property `org.jenkinsci.plugins.registry.notification.webhook.JSONWebHook.DO_NOT_REQUIRE_API_TOKEN` to `true` to disable this fix.",
