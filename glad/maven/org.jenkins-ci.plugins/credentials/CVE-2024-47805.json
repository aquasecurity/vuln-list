  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47805",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/credentials",
  "Title": "Jenkins Credentials plugin reveals encrypted values of credentials to users with Extended Read permission",
  "Description": "Jenkins Credentials Plugin 1380.va_435002fa_924 and earlier, except 1371.1373.v4eb_fa_b_7161e9, does not redact encrypted values of credentials using the `SecretBytes` type (e.g., Certificate credentials, or Secret file credentials from Plain Credentials Plugin) when accessing item `config.xml` via REST API or CLI.\n\nThis allows attackers with Item/Extended Read permission to view encrypted `SecretBytes` values in credentials.\n\nThis issue is similar to SECURITY-266 in the 2016-05-11 security advisory, which applied to the `Secret` type used for inline secrets and some credentials types.\n\nCredentials Plugin 1381.v2c3a_12074da_b_ redacts the encrypted values of credentials using the `SecretBytes` type in item `config.xml` files.\n\nThis fix is only effective on Jenkins 2.479 and newer, LTS 2.462.3 and newer. While Credentials Plugin 1381.v2c3a_12074da_b_ can be installed on Jenkins 2.463 through 2.478 (both inclusive), encrypted values of credentials using the `SecretBytes` type will not be redacted when accessing item `config.xml` via REST API or CLI.",
