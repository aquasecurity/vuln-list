  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-1000093",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/pollscm",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "The Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.",
