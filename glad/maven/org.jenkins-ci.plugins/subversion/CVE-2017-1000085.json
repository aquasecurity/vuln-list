  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-1000085",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/subversion",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository as part of form validation. This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with `Item/Build` permission (but not `Item/Configure`) to connect to any web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.",
