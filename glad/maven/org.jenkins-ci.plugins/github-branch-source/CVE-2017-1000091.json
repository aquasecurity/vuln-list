  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-1000091",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/github-branch-source",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "GitHub Branch Source Plugin connects to a user-specified GitHub API URL as part of form validation and completion. This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to connect to any web server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery.",
