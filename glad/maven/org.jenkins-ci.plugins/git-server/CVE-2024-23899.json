  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23899",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.jenkins-ci.plugins/git-server",
  "Title": "Arbitrary file read vulnerability in Git server Plugin can lead to RCE",
  "Description": "Jenkins Git server Plugin uses the [args4j](https://github.com/kohsuke/args4j) library to parse command arguments and options on the Jenkins controller when processing Git commands received via SSH. This command parser has a feature that replaces an @ character followed by a file path in an argument with the fileâ€™s contents (`expandAtFiles`). This feature is enabled by default and Git server Plugin 99.va_0826a_b_cdfa_d and earlier does not disable it.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to read the first two lines of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system using the default character encoding of the Jenkins controller process.\n\nSee [SECURITY-3314](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/#SECURITY-3314) for further information about the potential impact of being able to read files on the Jenkins controller, as well as the [limitations for reading binary files](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-01-24/#binary-files-note). Note that for this issue, unlike SECURITY-3314, attackers need Overall/Read permission.",
