  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.webjars.bower/angular",
  "Title": "angular vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking",
  "Description": "This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular expression used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking. With a large carefully-crafted input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis package is EOL and will not receive any updates to address this issue. Users should migrate to [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core).",
