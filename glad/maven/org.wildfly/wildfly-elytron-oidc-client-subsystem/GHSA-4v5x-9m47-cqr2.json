  "Description": "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of [GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc](https://advisory-inbox.githubapp.com/advisory_reviews/GHSA-5565-3c98-g6jc). This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nA vulnerability was found in OIDC-Client. When using the RH SSO OIDC adapter with EAP 7.x or when using the elytron-oidc-client subsystem with EAP 8.x, authorization code injection attacks can occur, allowing an attacker to inject a stolen authorization code into the attacker's own session with the client with a victim's identity. This is usually done with a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or phishing attack.",
