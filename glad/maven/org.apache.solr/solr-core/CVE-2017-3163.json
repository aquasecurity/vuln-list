  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-3163",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core",
  "Title": "Path traversal attack",
  "Description": "When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name Solr does not validate the file name, hence it is possible to craft a special request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access.",
