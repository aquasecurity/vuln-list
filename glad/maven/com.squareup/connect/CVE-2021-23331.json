  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-23331",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.squareup/connect",
  "Title": "Insecure Temporary File",
  "Description": "`prepareDownloadFilecreates` creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of -rw-r--r-- on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded by `downloadFileFromResponse` will be visible to all other users on the local system. A workaround fix for this issue is to set the system property `java.io.tmpdir` to a safe directory as remediation. Note: This version of the SDK is end of life and no longer maintained, please upgrade to the latest version.",
