  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-34750",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat-coyote",
  "Title": "Apache Tomcat - Denial of Service",
  "Description": "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.",
