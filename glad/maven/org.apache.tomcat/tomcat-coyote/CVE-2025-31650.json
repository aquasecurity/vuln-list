  "Title": "Apache Tomcat Denial of Service via invalid HTTP priority header",
  "Description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Incorrect error handling for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a memory leak.

The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.90 though 8.5.100.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.",
