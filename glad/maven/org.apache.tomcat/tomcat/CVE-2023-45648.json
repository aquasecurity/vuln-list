  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat",
  "Title": "Apache Tomcat Improper Input Validation vulnerability",
  "Description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nTomcatÂ from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.81 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A specially crafted, invalid trailer header could cause Tomcat to treat a single\nrequest as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request smuggling when behind a reverse proxy. Older, EOL versions may also be affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fix the issue.",
