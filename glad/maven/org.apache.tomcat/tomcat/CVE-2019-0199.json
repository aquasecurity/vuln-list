  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-0199",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat accepted streams with excessive numbers of `SETTINGS` frames and also permitted clients to keep streams open without reading/writing request/response data. By keeping streams open for requests that utilised the Servlet API's blocking I/O, clients were able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.",
