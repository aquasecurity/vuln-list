  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-17533",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-manager",
  "Title": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource",
  "Description": "Apache Accumulo does not properly check the return value of some policy enforcement functions before permitting an authenticated user to perform certain administrative operations. Specifically, the return values of the `canFlush` and `canPerformSystemActions` security functions are not checked in some instances, therefore allowing an authenticated user with insufficient permissions to perform the following actions: flushing a table, shutting down Accumulo or an individual tablet server, and setting or removing system-wide Accumulo configuration properties.",
