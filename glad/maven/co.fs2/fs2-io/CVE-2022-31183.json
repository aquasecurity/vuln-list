  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-31183",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/co.fs2/fs2-io",
  "Title": "fs2-io skips mTLS client verification",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen establishing a server-mode `TLSSocket` using `fs2-io` on Node.js, the parameter `requestCert = true` is ignored, peer certificate verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds.\n\nThe vulnerability is limited to:\n1. `fs2-io` running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent.\n2. `TLSSocket`s in server-mode. Client-mode `TLSSocket`s are implemented via a different API.\n3. mTLS as enabled via `requestCert = true` in `TLSParameters`. The default setting is `false` for server-mode `TLSSocket`s.\n\nIt was introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in v3.1.0.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch is released in v3.2.11. The `requestCert = true` parameter is respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails, a `SSLException` is raised.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf using an unpatched version on Node.js, do not use a server-mode `TLSSocket` with `requestCert = true` to establish a mTLS connection.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43994\n- https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue.](https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/issues/new/choose)\n* Contact the [Typelevel Security Team](https://github.com/typelevel/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n",
