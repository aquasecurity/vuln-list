  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-34453",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xerial.snappy/snappy-java",
  "Title": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
  "Description": "snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.\n\nThe function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.",
