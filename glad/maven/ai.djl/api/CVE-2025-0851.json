  "PackageSlug": "maven/ai.djl/api",
  "Title": "Deep Java Library path traversal issue",
  "Description": "[Deep Java Library (DJL)](https://docs.djl.ai/master/index.html) is an open-source, high-level, engine-agnostic Java framework for deep learning. DJL is designed to be easy to get started with and simple to use for Java developers. DJL provides a native Java development experience and functions like any other regular Java library.\n\nDJL provides utilities for extracting tar and zip model archives that are used when loading models for use with DJL. These utilities were found to contain issues that do not protect against absolute path traversal during the extraction process.",
