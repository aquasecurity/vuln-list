  "Title": "PowSyBl Core allows deserialization of untrusted SparseMatrix data",
  "Description": "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is a disclosure for a security vulnerability in the `SparseMatrix` class. The vulnerability is a deserialization issue that\ncan lead to a wide range of privilege escalations depending on the circumstances. The problematic area is the `read` method\nof the `SparseMatrix` class.\nThis method takes in an `InputStream` and returns a `SparseMatrix` object. We consider this to be a method that can be\nexposed to untrusted input in at least two use cases:\n- A user can adopt this method in an application where users can submit an `InputStream` and the application parses it into\na `SparseMatrix`. This can be a multi-tenant application that hosts many different users perhaps with different privilege\nlevels.\n- A user adopts the method for a local tool but receives the `InputStream` from external sources.",
