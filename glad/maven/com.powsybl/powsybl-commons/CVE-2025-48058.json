  "Title": "PowSyBl Core contains Polynomial REDoS’es",
  "Description": "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an advisory for a **potential polynomial Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability in the PowSyBl's DataSource mechanism. When the `listNames(String regex)` method is called on a DataSource, the user-supplied regular expression (which may be unvalidated) is compiled and evaluated against a collection of file-like resource names.\n\nTo trigger a **polynomial ReDoS** via this mechanism, **two attacker-controlled conditions** must be met:\n- **Control over the regex input** passed into `listNames(String regex)`.\n- _Example:_ An attacker supplies a malicious pattern like `(.*a){10000}`.\n- **Control or influence over the file/resource names** being matched.\n- _Example:_ Filenames such as `\"aaaa...!\"` that induce regex engine backtracking.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, a malicious actor can cause **significant CPU consumption** due to regex backtracking — even\nwith polynomial patterns. Since both inputs can be controlled via a publicly accessible method or external filesystem handling,\nthe `listNames(String regex)` method is considered vulnerable to polynomial **REDoS**.\n\nUnlike classic _catastrophic exponential_ ReDoS, this subtle attack exploits a greedy `.*` prefix followed by a fixed suffix, repeated multiple times.\nWhen applied to long filenames that almost match the pattern, the regex engine performs extensive backtracking, degrading performance predictably with input size. In a multi-tenant environment, an attacker can degrade the performance - and thereby the availability - of the server to an extent that it affects other users of the application. This can for example be useful if an attacker wants to delay other users in a scenario where a time advantage can be a competitive advantage.\nA tricky part in this is that the attacker needs to control both the pattern and the input which may not always be the case.",
