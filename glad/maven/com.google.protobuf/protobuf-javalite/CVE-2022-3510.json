  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-3510",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-javalite",
  "Title": "Protobuf Java vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with Message-Type Extensions in protobuf-java core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned above.",
