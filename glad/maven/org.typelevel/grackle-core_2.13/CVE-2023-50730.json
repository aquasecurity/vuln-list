  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.typelevel/grackle-core_2.13",
  "Title": "Grackle has StackOverflowError in GraphQL query processing",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nPrior to this fix, the GraphQL query parsing was vulnerable to `StackOverflowError`s. The possibility of small queries resulting in stack overflow is a potential denial of service vulnerability.\n\nThis potentially affects all applications using Grackle which have untrusted users.\n\n\u003e [!CAUTION] \n\u003e **No specific knowledge of an application's GraphQL schema would be required to construct a pathological query.**\n\n### Patches\nThe stack overflow issues have been resolved in the v0.18.0 release of Grackle.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers could interpose a sanitizing layer in between untrusted input and Grackle query processing.\n",
