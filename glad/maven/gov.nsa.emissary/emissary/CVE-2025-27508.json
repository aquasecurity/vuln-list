  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27508",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/gov.nsa.emissary/emissary",
  "Title": "Emissary May Use a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "Description": "The ChecksumCalculator class within  allows for hashing and checksum generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms, while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required.",
