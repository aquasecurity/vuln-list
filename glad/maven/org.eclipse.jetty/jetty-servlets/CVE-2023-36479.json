  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-36479",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-servlets",
  "Title": "Jetty vulnerable to errant command quoting in CGI Servlet",
  "Description": "If a user sends a request to a `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI` Servlet for a binary with a space in its name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark followed by a space, the resulting command line will contain multiple tokens instead of one. For example, if a request references a binary called file” name “here, the escaping algorithm will generate the command line string “file” name “here”, which will invoke the binary named file, not the one that the user requested.\n\n```java\nif (execCmd.length() \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 execCmd.charAt(0) != '\"' \u0026\u0026 execCmd.contains(\" \"))\nexecCmd = \"\\\"\" + execCmd + \"\\\"\";\n```",
