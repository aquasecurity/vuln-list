  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6763",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-http",
  "Title": "Eclipse Jetty URI parsing of invalid authority",
  "Description": "Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, `HttpURI`, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe `HttpURI` class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of `HttpURI` differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically `HttpURI` and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI is used after passing validation checks.",
