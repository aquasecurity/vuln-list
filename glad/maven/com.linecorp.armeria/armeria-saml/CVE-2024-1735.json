{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-1735",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.linecorp.armeria/armeria-saml",
  "Title": "Armeria SAML authentication bypass due to missing validation on unsigned SAML messages",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe SAML implementation provided by `armeria-saml` currently accepts unsigned SAML messages (assertions, logout requests, etc.) as they are, rather than rejecting them by default. As a result, an attacker can forge a SAML message to authenticate themselves, despite the fact that such an unsigned SAML message should be rejected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Armeria version 1.27.2. All users who rely on `armeria-saml` older than version 1.27.2 must upgrade to 1.27.2 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround for this vulnerability.\n\n",
