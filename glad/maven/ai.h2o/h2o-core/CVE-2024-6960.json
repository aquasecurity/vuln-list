  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6960",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/ai.h2o/h2o-core",
  "Title": "H2O vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "The H2O machine learning platform uses \"Iced\" classes as the primary means of moving Java Objects around the cluster. The Iced format supports inclusion of serialized Java objects. When a model is deserialized, any class is allowed to be deserialized (no class allowlist). An attacker can construct a crafted Iced model that uses Java gadgets and leads to arbitrary code execution when imported to the H2O platform.",
