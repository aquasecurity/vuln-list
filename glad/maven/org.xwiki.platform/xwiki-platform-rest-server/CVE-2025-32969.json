  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rest-server",
  "Title": "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rest-server allows SQL injection in query endpoint of REST API",
  "Description": "It is possible for a remote unauthenticated user to escape from the HQL execution context and perform a blind SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend, including when \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights\" and \"Prevent unregistered users from editing pages, regardless of the page rights\" options are enabled.\n\nDepending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries.\n\nThe vulnerability may be tested in a default installation of XWIki Standard Flavor, including using the official Docker containers.\n\nAn example query, which leads to SQL injection with MySQL/MariaDB backend is shown below:",
