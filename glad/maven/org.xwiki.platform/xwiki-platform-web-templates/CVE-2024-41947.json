  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-41947",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-web-templates",
  "Title": "XWiki Platform vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through conflict resolution",
  "Description": "By creating a conflict when another user with more rights is currently editing a page, it is possible to execute JavaScript snippets on the side of the other user, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce on a XWiki instance, a user with admin rights needs to edit a document without saving right away.\nThen, as another user without any other right than edit on the specific document, change the whole content to `\u003cscript\u003ealert('XSS')\u003c/script\u003e`.\nWhen the admin user then saves the document, a conflict popup appears. If they select \"Fix each conflict individually\" and see an alert displaying \"XSS\", then the instance is vulnerable.",
