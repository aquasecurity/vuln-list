  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23621",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-oldcore",
  "Title": "Missing Authorization",
  "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can read any file located in the XWiki WAR (for example xwiki.cfg and xwiki.properties) through XWiki#invokeServletAndReturnAsString as `$xwiki.invokeServletAndReturnAsString(\"/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg\")`. This issue has been patched in XWiki versions 12.10.9, 13.4.3 and 13.7-rc-1. Users are advised to update. The only workaround is to limit SCRIPT right.",
