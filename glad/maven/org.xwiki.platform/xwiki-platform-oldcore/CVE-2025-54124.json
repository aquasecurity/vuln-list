  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54124",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-oldcore",
  "Title": "XWiki leaks password hashes and other accessible password properties",
  "Description": "Any user with edit right on a page of the wiki can create an XClass with a database list property that references a password property, for example the password hash that is stored for users. When adding an object of that XClass, the content of that password property is displayed. In practice, with a standard rights setup, this means that any user with an account on the wiki can access password hashes of all users, and possibly other password properties (with hashed or plain storage) that are on pages that the user can view.",
