  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-50720",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-search-solr-api",
  "Title": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
  "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the Solr-based search in XWiki discloses the email addresses of users even when obfuscation of email addresses is enabled. To demonstrate the vulnerability, search for `objcontent:email*` using XWiki's regular search interface. This has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1 by not indexing email address properties when obfuscation is enabled. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
