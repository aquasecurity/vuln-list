  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-49585",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-security-requiredrights-default",
  "Title": "XWiki does not require right warnings for XClass definitions",
  "Description": "When an attacker without script or programming right creates an XClass definition in XWiki (requires edit right), and that same document is later edited by a user with script, admin, or programming right, malicious code could be executed with the rights of the editing user without prior warning. In particular, this concerns custom display code, the script of computed properties and queries in database list properties. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful.",
