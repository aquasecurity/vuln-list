  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-32974",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-security-requiredrights-default",
  "Title": "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security-requiredrights-default required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type",
  "Description": "When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce, as a user without script right, create a class with a `TextArea` property, create page with an object of that class and a Velocity macro in its content. Then, as an admin, try editing that page. Normally, there should be a warning but in vulnerable versions of XWiki, there is no warning.",
