  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-26471",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro",
  "Title": "XWiki Platform users may execute anything with superadmin right through comments and async macro",
  "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 11.6-rc-1, comments are supposed to be executed with the right of superadmin but in restricted mode (anything dangerous is disabled), but the async macro does not take into account the restricted mode. This means that any user with comment right can use the async macro to make it execute any wiki content with the right of superadmin. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10. The only known workaround consists of applying a patch and rebuilding and redeploying `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro`.",
