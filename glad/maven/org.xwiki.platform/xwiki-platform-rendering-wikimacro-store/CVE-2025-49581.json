  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-49581",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-rendering-wikimacro-store",
  "Title": "XWiki allows remote code execution through default value of wiki macro wiki-type parameters",
  "Description": "Any user with edit right on a page (could be the user's profile) can execute code (Groovy, Python, Velocity) with programming right by defining a wiki macro. This allows full access to the whole XWiki installation and thus impacts its confidentiality, integrity and availability. The main problem is that if a wiki macro parameter allows wiki syntax, its default value is executed with the rights of the author of the document where it is used. This can be exploited by overriding a macro like the `children` macro that is used in a page that has programming right like the page `XWiki.ChildrenMacro` and thus allows arbitrary script macros. The full reproduction steps can be found in the [original issue](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22760).",
