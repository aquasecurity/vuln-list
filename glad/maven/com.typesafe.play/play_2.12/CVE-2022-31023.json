  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-31023",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.typesafe.play/play_2.12",
  "Title": "Dev error stack trace leaking into prod in Play Framework",
  "Description": "Play Framework, when run in dev mode, shows verbose errors for easy debugging, including an exception stack trace. Play does this by configuring its `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` to do so based on the application mode. In its Scala API Play also provides a static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` that is configured to always show verbose errors. This is used as a default value in some Play APIs, so it is possible to inadvertently use this version in production. It is also possible to improperly configure the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object instance as the injected error handler.  Both of these situations could result in verbose errors displaying to users in a production application, which could expose sensitive information from the application.\n\nIn particular the constructor for `CORSFilter` and `apply` method for `CORSActionBuilder` use the static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` as a default value.",
