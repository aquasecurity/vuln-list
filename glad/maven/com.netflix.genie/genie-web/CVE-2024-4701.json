  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-4701",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.netflix.genie/genie-web",
  "Title": "Genie Path Traversal vulnerability via File Uploads",
  "Description": "Genie's API accepts a multipart/form-data file upload which can be saved to a location on disk. However, it takes a user-supplied filename as part of the request and uses this as the filename when writing the file to disk. Since this filename is user-controlled, it is possible for a malicious actor to manipulate the filename in order to break out of the default attachment storage path and perform path traversal.\n\nUsing this technique it is possible to write a file with any user specified name and file contents to any location on the file system that the Java process has write access to.",
