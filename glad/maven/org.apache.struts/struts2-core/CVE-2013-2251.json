  "Identifier": "CVE-2013-2251",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.struts/struts2-core",
  "Title": "Code injection in Apache Struts",
  "Description": "The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with \"action:\" or \"redirect:\", followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms.\n\nIn Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following \"action:\", \"redirect:\" or \"redirectAction:\" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code.",
