  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-12086",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind",
  "Title": "Information Exposure",
  "Description": "A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs because of missing `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin` validation.",
