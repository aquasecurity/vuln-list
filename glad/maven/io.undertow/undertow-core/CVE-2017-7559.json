  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-7559",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)",
  "Description": "Invalid characters are allowed in query strings and path parameters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.",
