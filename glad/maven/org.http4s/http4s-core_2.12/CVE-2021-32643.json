  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32643",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.http4s/http4s-core_2.12",
  "Title": "Path Traversal",
  "Description": "Http4s is a Scala interface for HTTP services. `StaticFile.fromUrl` can leak the presence of a directory on a server when the `URL` scheme is not `file://`, and the URL points to a fetchable resource under its scheme and authority. The function returns `F[None]`, indicating no resource, if `url.getFile` is a directory, without first checking the scheme or authority of the URL. If a URL connection to the scheme and URL would return a stream, and the path in the URL exists as a directory on the server, the presence of the directory on the server could be inferred from the response. The contents and other metadata about the directory are not exposed.",
