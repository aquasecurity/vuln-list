  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-39185",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.http4s/http4s-server",
  "Title": "Origin Validation Error",
  "Description": "Http4s is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. In http4s versions 0.21.26 and prior, 0.22.0 through 0.22.2, 0.23.0, 0.23.1, and 1.0.0-M1 through 1.0.0-M24, the default CORS configuration is vulnerable to an origin reflection attack. The middleware is also susceptible to a Null Origin Attack. The problem is fixed in 0.21.27, 0.22.3, 0.23.2, and 1.0.0-M25. The original `CORS` implementation and `CORSConfig` are deprecated. See the GitHub GHSA for more information, including code examples and workarounds.",
