  "Title": "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module ",
  "Description": "### Impact\nThe module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module operations. Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code. This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, allowing unauthorized read access to these mod-inventory-storage records: instances, holdings, items, contributor-types, identifier-types. This includes records marked as suppressed from discovery.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade mod-remote-storage to \u003e=2.0.3, or a 1.7.x version \u003e=1.7.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo known workarounds.\n\n### References\nhttps://wiki.folio.org/x/hbMMBw - FOLIO Security Advisory with Upgrade Instructions\nhttps://github.com/folio-org/mod-remote-storage/commit/57df495f76e9aa5be9ce7ce3a65f89b6dbcbc13b - Fix",
