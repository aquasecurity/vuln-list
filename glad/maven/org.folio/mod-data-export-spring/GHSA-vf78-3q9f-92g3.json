  "Title": "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module ",
  "Description": "### Impact\nThe module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module operations. Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code. This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially dangerous APIs, allowing to view and modify configuration including single-sign-on configuration, to read, add and modify user data, and to read and transfer fees/fines in a patron's account.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade mod-data-export-spring to \u003e=2.0.2, or a 1.5.x version \u003e=1.5.4.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo known workarounds.\n\n### References\nhttps://wiki.folio.org/x/hbMMBw - FOLIO Security Advisory with Upgrade Instructions\nhttps://github.com/folio-org/mod-data-export-spring/commit/93aff4566bff59e30f4121b5a2bda5b0b508a446 - Fix",
