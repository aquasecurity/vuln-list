  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21409",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.zookeeper/zookeeper",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)",
  "Description": "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers \u0026 clients. In Netty (`io.netty:netty-codec-http2`), which is used by zookeeper, there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single `Http2HeaderFrame` with the `endStream` set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case.",
