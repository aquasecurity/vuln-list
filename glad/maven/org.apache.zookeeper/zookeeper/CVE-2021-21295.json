  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.zookeeper/zookeeper",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')",
  "Description": "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers \u0026 clients. `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects, and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer. This has been patched Final As a workaround, the user can do the validation by themselves by implementing a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.",
