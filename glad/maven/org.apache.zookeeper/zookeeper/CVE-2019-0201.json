  "Title": "Information disclosure",
  "Description": "ZooKeeper's `getACL()` command does not check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. `DigestAuthenticationProvider` overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by `getACL()` request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.",
