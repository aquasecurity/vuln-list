  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-7649",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.eclipse.kura/kura",
  "Title": "Improper Authentication",
  "Description": "Kura takes control over the device's firewall setup but does not allow IPv6 firewall rules to be configured. The Equinox console port is left open, logs into Kura without any user credentials over unencrypted telnet and executes commands using the Equinox `exec` command. As the process is running as `root` full control over the device can be acquired. IPv6 is also left in auto-configuration mode, accepting router advertisements automatically and assigns a MAC address based IPv6 address.",
