  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-43123",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.storm/storm-core",
  "Title": "Apache Storm Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Storm-core on Unix-Like systems due temporary files ",
  "Description": "On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.\n\nThe method File.createTempFile on unix-like systems creates a file with predefined name (so easily identifiable) and by default will create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information.\n\nFile.createTempFile(String, String) will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set.",
