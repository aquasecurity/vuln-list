  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-5736",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.mesos/mesos",
  "Title": "Containment Errors (Container Errors)",
  "Description": "runc allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to `/proc/self/exe`.",
