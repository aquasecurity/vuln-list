  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23636",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.alipay.sofa/rpc-sofa-boot-starter",
  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. SOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA Hessian protocol to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian protocol uses a block list mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But, prior to version 5.12.0, there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian block list protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. Version 5.12.0 fixed this issue by adding a block list. SOFARPC also provides a way to add additional block lists. Users can add a class like `-Drpc_serialize_block list_override=org.apache.xpath.` to avoid this issue.",
