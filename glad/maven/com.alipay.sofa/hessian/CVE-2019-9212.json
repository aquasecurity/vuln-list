  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-9212",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.alipay.sofa/hessian",
  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** SOFA-Hessian through 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted serialized Hessian object because denylisting of com.caucho.naming.QName and com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.objects.XString is mishandled, related to Resin Gadget. NOTE: The vendor doesnâ€™t consider this issue a vulnerability because the denylist is being misused. SOFA Hessian supports custom denylist and a disclaimer was posted encouraging users to update the denylist or to use the allowlist feature for their specific needs since the denylist is not being actively updated.",
