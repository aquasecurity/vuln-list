  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.dspace/dspace-api",
  "Title": "DSpace is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks when importing packages using Simple Archive Format",
  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability is possible during the import of an archive (in [Simple Archive Format](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=104566653)), either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the \"Batch Import (Zip)\" user interface feature.  _This vulnerability likely impacts all versions of DSpace 1.x \u003c= 7.6.3, 8.0 \u003c= 8.1, and 9.0_.\n\nAn attacker may craft a malicious Simple Archive Format (SAF) package where the `contents` file references any system files (using relative traversal sequences) which are readable by the Tomcat user.  If such a package is imported, this will result in sensitive content disclose, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running.\n\n**The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators** (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line).  Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator (who would trigger the import).\n* **The most severe practical impact** is a case where an attacker obtains DSpace administrator credentials and uses the Batch Import feature with a malicious SAF archive to expose sensitive local files readable by the Tomcat user.\n* An attacker without administrative credentials might use some other tactic to convince an administrator to import a malicious SAF archive they have supplied.",
