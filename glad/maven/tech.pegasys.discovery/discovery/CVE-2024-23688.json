  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23688",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/tech.pegasys.discovery/discovery",
  "Title": "Discovery uses the same AES/GCM Nonce throughout the session",
  "Description": "Discovery uses the same AES/GCM Nonce throughout the session though it should be generated on per message basis which can lead to the leaking of the session key.  As the actual ENR record is signed with a different key it is not possible for an attacker to alter the ENR record. Note that the node private key is not compromised, only the session key generated to communicate with an individual peer.",
