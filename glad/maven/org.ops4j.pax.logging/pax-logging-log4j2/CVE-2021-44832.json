  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-44832",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.ops4j.pax.logging/pax-logging-log4j2",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation and Injection in Apache Log4j2",
  "Description": "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to an attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.",
