  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-42920",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.bcel/bcel",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.",
