  "Title": "DoS vulnerabilities persist in ESAPI file uploads despite remediation of CVE-2023-24998",
  "Description": "ESAPI 2.5.2.0 and later addressed the DoS vulnerability described in CVE-2023-24998, which Apache Commons FileUpload 1.5 attempted to remediate. But while writing up a new security bulletin regarding the impact on the affected ESAPI `HTTPUtilities.getFileUploads` methods (or more specifically those methods in the `DefaultHTTPUtilities` implementation class), I realized that a DoS vulnerability still persists in ESAPI and for that matter in Apache Commons FileUpload as well.",
