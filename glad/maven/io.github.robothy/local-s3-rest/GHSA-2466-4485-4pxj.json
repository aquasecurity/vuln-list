  "Title": "LocalS3 Project Bucket Operations Vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection",
  "Description": "The LocalS3 project contains an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in its bucket operations that process XML data. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the bucket ACL and bucket tagging operations. The application processes XML input without properly disabling external entity resolution, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because the XML parser used by the application processes DOCTYPE declarations and allows external entity references. When processing bucket ACL or tagging operations, the application includes the content of external entities in its response, effectively exposing sensitive files from the server.\n\nThis type of vulnerability can be exploited to read sensitive files, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or potentially achieve denial of service through various XXE attack vectors.",
