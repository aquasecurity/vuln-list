Veracode Azure DevOps Extension before 3.20.0 invokes the Veracode Java API Wrapper in a manner that allows local users (with OS-level access to the Azure DevOps Services cloud infrastructure or Azure DevOps Server) to discover Veracode API credentials by listing the process and its arguments. Veracode Azure DevOps Extension before 3.20.0, when configured with proxy credentials, allows users (with shell access to the Azure DevOps Services cloud infrastructure or Azure DevOps Server) to discover proxy credentials by listing the process and its arguments.",
