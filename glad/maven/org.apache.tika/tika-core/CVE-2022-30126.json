  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-30126",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.tika/tika-core",
  "Title": "Regular expression denial of service in apache tika",
  "Description": "In Apache Tika, a regular expression in our StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler.\n\nThis was originally fixed in 1.28.2 and 2.4.0. While the fix in version 2.4.0 was complete, the fix for the 1.x branch wasn't incorporated until version 1.28.3. Please see GHSA-qw3f-w4pf-jh5f for more information.",
