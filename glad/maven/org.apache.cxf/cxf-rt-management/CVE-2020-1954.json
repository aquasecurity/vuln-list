  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-1954",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.cxf/cxf-rt-management",
  "Title": "Information Exposure",
  "Description": "Apache CXF has the ability to integrate with JMX by registering an `InstrumentationManager` extension with the CXF bus. If the ‘createMBServerConnectorFactory‘ property of the default `InstrumentationManagerImpl` is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack. An attacker on the same host can connect to the registry and rebind the entry to another server, thus acting as a proxy to the original. They are then able to gain access to all of the information that is sent and received over JMX.",
