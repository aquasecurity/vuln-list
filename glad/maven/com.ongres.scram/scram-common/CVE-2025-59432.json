  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59432",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.ongres.scram/scram-common",
  "Title": "Timing Attack Vulnerability in SCRAM Authentication",
  "Description": "A timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The issue arises because `Arrays.equals` was used to compare secret values such as client proofs and server signatures. Since `Arrays.equals` performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted.",
