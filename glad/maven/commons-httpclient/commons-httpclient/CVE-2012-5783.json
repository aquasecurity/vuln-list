  "Identifier": "CVE-2012-5783",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/commons-httpclient/commons-httpclient",
  "Title": "Improper Certificate Validation in Apache Commons HttpClient",
  "Description": "Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.\n\nNote that the Commons HttpClient project is [end of life](https://hc.apache.org/httpclient-legacy/). It has been replaced by the Apache HttpComponents project in its [HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.4.x/) and [HttpCore](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-5.3.x/) modules. CVE-2012-5783 has been patched in [v4.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpclient/4.0/) of the Apache HttpComponents HttpClient module.",
