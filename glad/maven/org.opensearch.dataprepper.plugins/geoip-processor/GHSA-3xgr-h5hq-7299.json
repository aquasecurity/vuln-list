  "Title": "GeoIP processor disables SSL certificate validation when downloading databases",
  "Description": "The GeoIP processor in Data Prepper was configured to trust all SSL certificates and disable hostname verification when downloading GeoIP databases from HTTP URLs, making downloads vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe GeoIP processor included a custom SSL implementation that completely bypassed certificate validation when downloading GeoIP databases from external sources. The `initiateSSL()` method incorrectly implemented an approach for trusting all certificates. Specifically it:\n\n* Accepted all SSL certificates without validation\n* Disabled server certificate verification\n* Disabled client certificate verification\n* Disabled hostname verification\n\nThis configuration made database downloads vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially allowing attackers to serve malicious GeoIP databases that could compromise the integrity of geolocation data processing.",
