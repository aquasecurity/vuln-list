  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-6393",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.quarkus/quarkus-cache",
  "Title": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial \"completion\" context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context. This is a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information, and could allow a malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data.",
