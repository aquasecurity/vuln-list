  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-32952",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.jmix.localfs/jmix-localfs",
  "Title": "io.jmix.localfs:jmix-localfs affected by DoS in the Local File Storage",
  "Description": "The local file storage implementation does not restrict the size of uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this by uploading excessively large files, potentially causing the server to run out of space and return HTTP 500 error, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nThe severity of the vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the application UI and the generic REST API are typically accessible only to authenticated users. Additionally, the /files endpoint in Jmix requires specific permissions and is disabled by default.",
