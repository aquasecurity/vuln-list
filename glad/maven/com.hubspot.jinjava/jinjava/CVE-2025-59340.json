  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-59340",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.hubspot.jinjava/jinjava",
  "Title": "jinjava has Sandbox Bypass via JavaType-Based Deserialization",
  "Description": "jinjavaâ€™s current sandbox restrictions prevent direct access to dangerous methods such as `getClass()`, and block instantiation of Class objects. However, these protections can be bypassed.\n\nBy using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(), it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals.\n\nAs a result, an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL, opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining, this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE).",
