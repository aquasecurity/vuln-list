  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23683",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/de.tum.in.ase/artemis-java-test-sandbox",
  "Title": "Trust Boundary Violation due to Incomplete `Blacklist` in Test Failure Processing in Ares",
  "Description": "This allows an attacker to create special subclasses of `InvocationTargetException` that escape the exception sanitization because JUnit extracts the cause in a trusted context before the exception reaches Ares. This means that arbitrary student code can be executed in a trusted context, and that in turn allows disabling Ares and having full control over the system.",
