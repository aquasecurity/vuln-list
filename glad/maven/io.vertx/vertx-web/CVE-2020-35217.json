  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-35217",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.vertx/vertx-web",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "Vert.x-Web framework does not perform a correct CSRF verification. Instead of comparing the CSRF token in the request with the CSRF token in the cookie, it compares the CSRF token in the cookie against a CSRF token that is stored in the session. An attacker does not even need to provide a CSRF token in the request because the framework does not consider it. The cookies are automatically sent by the browser and the verification will always succeed, leading to a successful CSRF attack.",
