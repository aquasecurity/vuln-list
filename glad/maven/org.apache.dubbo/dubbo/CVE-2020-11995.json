  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-11995",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.apache.dubbo/dubbo",
  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "A deserialization vulnerability existed in dubbo which could lead to malicious code execution. Most Dubbo users use `Hessian2` as the default serialization/deserialization protool, during `Hessian2` deserializing the HashMap object, some functions in the classes stored in HasMap will be executed after a series of program calls, however, those special functions may cause remote command execution. For example, the `hashCode()` function of the EqualsBean class in rome-1.7.0.jar will cause the remotely load malicious classes and execute malicious code by constructing a malicious request. This issue was fixed in Apache Dubbo ",
