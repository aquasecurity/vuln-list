  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26271",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom",
  "Title": "Use of Uninitialized Resource",
  "Description": "In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases, loading a saved model can result in accessing uninitialized memory while building the computation graph. The `MakeEdge` function creates an edge between one output tensor of the src node (given by `output_index`) and the input slot of the dst node (given by `input_index`). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding `DataType` values and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out-of-bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library.",
