  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.codehaus.groovy/groovy",
  "Title": "Information Disclosure in Apache Groovy",
  "Description": "Apache Groovy provides extension methods to aid with creating temporary directories.

Users not using the extension methods mentioned in the advisory are not affected, but may wish to read the advisory for further details. Versions Affected: 2.0 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13, 3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1. Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2.",
