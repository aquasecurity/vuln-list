  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-27217",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.eclipse.hono/hono-core",
  "Title": "Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input in Eclipse Hono",
  "Description": "In Eclipse Hono the AMQP protocol adapter does not verify the size of AMQP messages received from devices. In particular, a device may send messages that are bigger than the max-message-size that the protocol adapter has indicated during link establishment. While the AMQP protocol explicitly disallows a peer to send such messages, a hand crafted AMQP client could exploit this behavior in order to send a message of unlimited size to the adapter, eventually causing the adapter to fail with an out of memory exception.",
