  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.graylog2/graylog2-server",
  "Title": "Graylog vulnerable to privilege escalation through API tokens",
  "Description": "Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user knows the ID.\n\nFor the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation.",
