  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-8929",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/com.google.crypto.tink/tink",
  "Title": "Ciphertext Malleability Issue in Tink Java",
  "Description": "Tink's Java version before 1.5 under some circumstances allowed attackers to change the key ID part of the ciphertext, resulting in the attacker creating a second ciphertext that will decrypt to the same plaintext. This can be a problem in particular in the case of encrypting with a deterministic AEAD with a single key, and relying on the fact that there is only a single valid ciphertext per plaintext.\n\nNo loss of confidentiality or loss of plaintext integrity occurs due to this problem, only ciphertext integrity is compromised.",
