  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.jenkins.plugins/testsigma",
  "Title": "Jenkins Testsigma Test Plan vulnerability exposes API keys via job configuration form",
  "Description": "Jenkins Testsigma Test Plan run Plugin stores Testsigma API keys in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nWhile these API keys are stored encrypted on disk, in Testsigma Test Plan run Plugin 1.6 and earlier, the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
