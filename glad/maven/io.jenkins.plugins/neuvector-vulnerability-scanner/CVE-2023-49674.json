  "Title": "Jenkins NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin missing permission check",

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port using attacker-specified username and password. Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nNeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 2.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint.",
