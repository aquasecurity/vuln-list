{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-0778",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/openssl",
  "Title": "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')",
  "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters",
