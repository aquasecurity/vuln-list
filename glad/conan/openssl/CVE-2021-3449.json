  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-3449",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/openssl",
  "Title": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
  "Description": "An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation `ClientHello` message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation `ClientHello` omits the `signature_algorithms` extension (where it was present in the initial `ClientHello`), but includes a `signature_algorithms_cert` extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue.",
