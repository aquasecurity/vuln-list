  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-24240",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/bison",
  "Title": "Use After Free",
  "Description": "GNU Bison has a use-after-free in `_obstack_free` in `lib/obstack.c` (called from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.",
