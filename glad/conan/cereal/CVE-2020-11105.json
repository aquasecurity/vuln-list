  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-11105",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/cereal",
  "Title": "Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal. It employs caching of `std::shared_ptr` values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic if a `std::shared_ptr variable` goes out of scope and is freed, and a new `std::shared_ptr` is allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent upon memory layout. In short, serialized `std::shared_ptr` variables cannot always be expected to serialize back into their original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending on the context within which this manifests.",
