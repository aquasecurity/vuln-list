  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-32067",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/c-ares",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to denial of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.1.",
