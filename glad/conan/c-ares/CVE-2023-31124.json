{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-31124",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/c-ares",
  "Title": "Use of Insufficiently Random Values",
  "Description": "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When cross-compiling c-ares and using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64 android. This will downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG. This issue was patched in version 1.19.1.\n",
