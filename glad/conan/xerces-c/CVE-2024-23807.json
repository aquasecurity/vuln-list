  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23807",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/xerces-c",
  "Title": "Use After Free",
  "Description": "The Apache Xerces C++ XML parser on versions 3.0.0 before 3.2.5 contains a  use-after-free error triggered during the scanning of external DTDs. Users are  recommended to upgrade to version 3.2.5 which fixes the issue, or mitigate the  issue by disabling DTD processing. This can be accomplished via the DOM using a  standard parser feature, or via SAX using the XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment  variable. This issue has been disclosed before as CVE-2018-1311, but unfortunately  that advisory incorrectly stated the issue would be fixed in version 3.2.3 or 3.2.4.\n",
