  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-6918",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/libssh2",
  "Title": "Unchecked Return Value",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.",
