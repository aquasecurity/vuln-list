  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-38545",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/libcurl",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy\nhandshake.\n\nWhen curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow\nthat to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the\nmaximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.\n\nIf the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name\nresolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,\nthe local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the\nwrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,\ncopy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the\nresolved address there.\n\nThe target buffer being a heap based buffer, and the host name coming from the\nURL that curl has been told to operate with.\n",
