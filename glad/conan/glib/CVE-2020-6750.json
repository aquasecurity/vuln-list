  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-6750",
  "PackageSlug": "conan/glib",
  "Title": "Information Exposure",
  "Description": "`GSocketClient` in GNOME GLib may occasionally connect directly to a target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when configured to do so, because the `proxy_addr` field is mishandled. This bug is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical barrier to a direct connection.",
