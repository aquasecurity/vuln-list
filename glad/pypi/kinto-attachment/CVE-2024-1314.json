  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-1314",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/kinto-attachment",
  "Title": "Kinto Attachment's attachments can be replaced on read-only records",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe attachment file of an existing record can be replaced if the user has `\"read\"` permission on one of the parent (collection or bucket).\n\nAnd if the `\"read\"` permission is given to `\"system.Everyone\"` on one of the parent, then the attachment can be replaced on a record using an anonymous request.\n\nNote that if the parent has no explicit read permission, then the records attachments are safe.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Patch released in kinto-attachment 6.4.0\n- https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-attachment/commit/f4a31484f5925cbc02b59ebd37554538ab826ca1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone if the read permission has to remain granted.\n\nUpdating to 6.4.0 or applying the patch individually (if updating is not feasible) is strongly recommended.\n\n### References\n\n- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1879034",
