  "Title": "Pixar OpenUSD Sdf_PathNode Module Use-After-Free Vulnerability Leading to Potential Remote Code Execution",
  "Description": "A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability has been discovered in the Sdf_PathNode module of the Pixar OpenUSD library. This issue occurs during the deletion of the Sdf_PrimPathNode object in multi-threaded environments, where freed memory is accessed. This results in segmentation faults or bus errors, allowing attackers to potentially exploit the vulnerability for remote code execution (RCE). By using a specially crafted .usd file, an attacker could gain control of the affected system. The vulnerability has been confirmed in multiple OpenUSD tools, including sdfdump, usdtree, usdcat, and sdffilter.",
