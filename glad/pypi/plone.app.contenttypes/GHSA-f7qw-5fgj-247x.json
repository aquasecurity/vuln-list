  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting and Open Redirect in plone.app.contenttypes",
  "Description": "Plone is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the `image_view_fullscreen` page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on your cache settings.",
