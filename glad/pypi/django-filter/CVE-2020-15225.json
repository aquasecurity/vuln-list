  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15225",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/django-filter",
  "Title": "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types",
  "Description": "django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on user selections. In django-filter, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. + applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.",
