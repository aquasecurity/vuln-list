  "Identifier": "CVE-2014-0105",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/python-keystoneclient",
  "Title": "Privilege escalation in auth_token middleware under sufficient load",
  "Description": "By doing repeated requests, with sufficient load on the target system, an authenticated user may in certain situations assume another authenticated user's complete identity and multi-tenant authorizations, potentially resulting in a privilege escalation. Note that it is related to a bad interaction between eventlet and python-memcached that should be avoided if the calling process already monkey-patches \"thread\" to use eventlet. Only keystone middleware setups using auth_token with memcache are vulnerable.",
