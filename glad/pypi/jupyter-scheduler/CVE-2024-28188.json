  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28188",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyter-scheduler",
  "Title": "jupyter-scheduler's endpoint is missing authentication",
  "Description": "`jupyter_scheduler` is missing an authentication check in Jupyter Server on an API endpoint (`GET /scheduler/runtime_environments`) which lists the names of the Conda environments on the server. In affected versions, `jupyter_scheduler` allows an unauthenticated user to obtain the list of Conda environment names on the server. This reveals any information that may be present in a Conda environment name.\n\nThis issue does **not** allow an unauthenticated third party to read, modify, or enter the Conda environments present on the server where `jupyter_scheduler` is running. This issue only reveals the list of Conda environment names.\n\nImpacted versions: `\u003e=1.0.0,\u003c=1.1.5 ; ==1.2.0 ; \u003e=1.3.0,\u003c=1.8.1 ; \u003e=2.0.0,\u003c=2.5.1`",
