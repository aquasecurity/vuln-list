  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54886",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/skops",
  "Title": "SKOPS Card.get_model happily allows arbitrary code execution",
  "Description": "The `Card` class of `skops`, used for model documentation and sharing, allows arbitrary code execution. When a file other than `.zip` is provided to the `Card` class during instantiation, the internally invoked `Card.get_model` method silently falls back to `joblib` without warning. Unlike the `.skops` zip-based format, `joblib` permits unrestricted code execution, hence bypassing the security measures of `skops` and enabling the execution of malicious code.",
