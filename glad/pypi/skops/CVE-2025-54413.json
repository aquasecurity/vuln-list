  "Title": "Skops may allow MethodNode to access unexpected object fields through dot notation, leading to arbitrary code execution at load time",
  "Description": "An inconsistency in `MethodNode` can be exploited to access unexpected object fields through dot notation. This can be used to achieve **arbitrary code execution at load time**.\n\nWhile this issue may seem similar to https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/security/advisories/GHSA-m7f4-hrc6-fwg3, it is actually more severe, as it relies on fewer assumptions about trusted types.",
