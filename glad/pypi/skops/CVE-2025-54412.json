  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54412",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/skops",
  "Title": "Skops has Inconsistent Trusted Type Validation that Enables Hidden `operator` Methods Execution",
  "Description": "An inconsistency in `OperatorFuncNode` can be exploited to hide the execution of untrusted `operator.xxx` methods. This can then be used in a code reuse attack to invoke seemingly safe functions and escalate to arbitrary code execution with minimal and misleading trusted types.\n\n**Note:** This report focuses on `operator.call` as it appears to be the most interesting target, but the same technique applies to other `operator` methods. Moreover, focusing on a specific example is not necessary, the `operator.call` invocation was a zero-effort choice meant solely to demonstrate the issue. The key point is the **inconsistency** that allows a user to approve a type as trusted, while in reality enabling the execution of `operator.xxx`.",
