  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-6580",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/priority",
  "Title": "DoS via Unlimited Stream Insertion",
  "Description": "An HTTP/2 implementation built using the priority library could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually *use* a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.",
