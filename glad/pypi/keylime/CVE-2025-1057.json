  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-1057",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/keylime",
  "Title": "Keylime registrar is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service attack when updated to version 7.12.0",
  "Description": "The Keylime `registrar` implemented more strict type checking on version 7.12.0. As a result, when updated to version 7.12.0, the `registrar` will not accept the format of the data previously stored in the database by versions  \u003e= 7.8.0, raising an exception.\n\nThis makes the Keylime `registrar` vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack in an update scenario, as an attacker could populate the `registrar` database by creating multiple valid agent registrations with different UUIDs while the version is still \u003c 7.12.0. Then, when the Keylime `registrar` is updated to the 7.12.0 version, any query to the database matching any of the entries populated by the attacker will result in failure.",
