  "Title": "vLLM vulnerable to DoS with incorrect shape of multimodal embedding inputs",
  "Description": "Users can crash the vLLM engine serving multimodal models by passing multimodal embedding inputs with correct `ndim` but incorrect `shape` (e.g. hidden dimension is wrong), regardless of whether the model is intended to support such inputs (as defined in the Supported Models page).\n\nThe issue has existed ever since we added support for image embedding inputs, i.e. #6613 (released in v0.5.5)",
