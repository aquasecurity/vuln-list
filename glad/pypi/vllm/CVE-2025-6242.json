  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-6242",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vllm",
  "Title": "vLLM is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through `MediaConnector` class",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `MediaConnector` class within the vLLM project's multimodal feature set. The `load_from_url` and `load_from_url_async` methods fetch and process media from user-provided URLs without adequate restrictions on the target hosts. This allows an attacker to coerce the vLLM server into making arbitrary requests to internal network resources.\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly critical in containerized environments like `llm-d`, where a compromised vLLM pod could be used to scan the internal network, interact with other pods, and potentially cause denial of service or access sensitive data. For example, an attacker could make the vLLM pod send malicious requests to an internal `llm-d` management endpoint, leading to system instability by falsely reporting metrics like the KV cache state.",
