  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66448",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vllm",
  "Title": "vLLM vulnerable to remote code execution via transformers_utils/get_config",
  "Description": "`vllm` has a critical remote code execution vector in a config class named `Nemotron_Nano_VL_Config`. When `vllm` loads a model config that contains an `auto_map` entry, the config class resolves that mapping with `get_class_from_dynamic_module(...)` and immediately instantiates the returned class. This fetches and executes Python from the remote repository referenced in the `auto_map` string. Crucially, this happens even when the caller explicitly sets `trust_remote_code=False` in `vllm.transformers_utils.config.get_config`. In practice, an attacker can publish a benign-looking frontend repo whose `config.json` points via `auto_map` to a separate malicious backend repo; loading the frontend will silently run the backend’s code on the victim host.",
