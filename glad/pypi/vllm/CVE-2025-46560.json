  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-46560",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vllm",
  "Title": "phi4mm: Quadratic Time Complexity in Input Token Processing​ leads to denial of service",
  "Description": "A critical performance vulnerability has been identified in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., \u003c|audio_*|\u003e, \u003c|image_*|\u003e) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​, the algorithm exhibits ​​quadratic time complexity (O(n²))​​, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs.",
