  "Title": "vLLM has a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS, Exponential Complexity) Vulnerability in `pythonic_tool_parser.py`",
  "Description": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the file [`vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/pythonic_tool_parser.py`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/pythonic_tool_parser.py) of the vLLM project. The root cause is the use of a highly complex and nested regular expression for tool call detection, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause severe performance degradation or make the service unavailable.",
