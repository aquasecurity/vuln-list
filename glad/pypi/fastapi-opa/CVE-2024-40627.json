  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-40627",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fastapi-opa",
  "Title": "OpaMiddleware does not filter HTTP OPTIONS requests",
  "Description": "HTTP `OPTIONS` requests are always allowed by `OpaMiddleware`, even when they lack authentication, and are passed through directly to the application.\n\nThe maintainer uncertain whether this should be classed as a \"bug\" or \"security issue\" â€“ but is erring on the side of \"security issue\" as an application could reasonably assume OPA controls apply to *all* HTTP methods, and it bypasses more sophisticated policies.",
