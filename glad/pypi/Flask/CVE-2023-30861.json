  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Flask",
  "Title": "Flask vulnerable to possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header",
  "Description": "When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by a proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session, and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on _all_ these conditions being met.",
