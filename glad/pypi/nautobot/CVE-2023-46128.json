  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-46128",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/nautobot",
  "Title": "Nautobot vulnerable to exposure of hashed user passwords via REST API",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn Nautobot 2.0.x, certain REST API endpoints, in combination\n with the `?depth=\u003cN\u003e` query parameter, can expose hashed user passwords \nas stored in the database to any authenticated user with access to these endpoints. \n\nThe passwords are *not* exposed in plaintext. \n\nNautobot 1.x is *not* affected by this vulnerability. \n\nThis information is not exposed during direct access to the `/api/users/users/` \nendpoint, but can be exposed through any endpoint which contains a nested \nreference to User object(s) when an appropriate `?depth=\u003cN\u003e` query parameter \nis specified. Known impacted endpoints include:\n\n- `/api/dcim/rack-reservations/?depth=1`(or\n any greater `depth` value)\n- `/api/extras/job-results/?depth=1` (or any greater\n `depth` value)\n- `/api/extras/notes/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)\n-\n `/api/extras/object-changes/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)\n- `/api/extras/scheduled-jobs/?depth=1`\n (or any greater `depth` value)\n- `/api/users/permissions/?depth=1` (or any greater\n `depth` value)\n\nbut this is not necessarily an exhaustive list. \n\nPlugin REST API endpoints for any models with a foreign key to the User \nmodel may also be impacted by this issue.\n\nThe patch identified below mitigates the issue for both Nautobot core \nREST APIs and plugin REST APIs; no code change in plugins is required to \naddress this issue.\n\n ### Patches\n\nRefer to https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4692 for the patch \nthat resolved this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading to v2.0.3 or later, or applying the above patch, is the preferred \nworkaround for this issue; while it could also be partially mitigated by \nupdating permissions to deny user access to the above list of impacted \nREST API endpoints, that is not recommended as other endpoints may also \nexpose this issue until patched.\n\n ### References\n\nhttps://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4692\n",
