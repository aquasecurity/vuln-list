  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-34707",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/nautobot",
  "Title": "Nautobot's BANNER_* configuration can be used to inject arbitrary HTML content into Nautobot pages",
  "Description": "A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS).",
