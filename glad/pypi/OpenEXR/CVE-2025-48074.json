  "Title": "OpenEXR Out-Of-Memory via Unbounded File Header Values",
  "Description": "The OpenEXR file format defines many information about the final image inside of the file header, such as the size of data/display window.\n\nThe application trusts the value of `dataWindow` size provided in the header of the input file, and performs computations based on this value.\n\nThis may result in unintended behaviors, such as excessively large number of iterations and/or huge memory allocations.",
