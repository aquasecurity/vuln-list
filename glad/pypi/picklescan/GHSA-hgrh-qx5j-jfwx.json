  "Title": "Picklescan Bypasses Unsafe Globals Check using pty.spawn",
  "Description": "The vulnerability allows malicious actors to bypass PickleScan's unsafe globals check, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The issue stems from the absence of the `pty` library (more specifically, of  the `pty.spawn` function) from PickleScan's list of unsafe globals. This vulnerability allows attackers to disguise malicious pickle payloads within files that would otherwise be scanned for pickle-based threats.",
