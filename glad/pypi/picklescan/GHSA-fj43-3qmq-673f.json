  "Title": "Picklescan failed to detect to some unsafe global function in Numpy library",
  "Description": "An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Pythonâ€™s pickle module allows an attacker to bypass static analysis tools like Picklescan and execute arbitrary code during deserialization. This can be exploited by import some built-in function in Numpy library that indrectly call some dangerous function like exec() to execute some python code as a parameter, which the attacker can import dangerous library inside like os library and execute arbitrary OS commands.",
