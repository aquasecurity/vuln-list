  "Title": "Picklescan is Vulnerable to Unsafe Globals Check Bypass through Subclass Imports",
  "Description": "The vulnerability allows malicious actors to bypass PickleScan's unsafe globals check, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. The issue stems from PickleScan's strict check for full module names against its list of unsafe globals. By using subclasses of dangerous imports instead of the exact module names, attackers can circumvent the check and inject malicious payloads.",
