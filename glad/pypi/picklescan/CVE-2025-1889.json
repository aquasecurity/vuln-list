  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-1889",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/picklescan",
  "Title": "PyTorch Model Files Can Bypass Pickle Scanners via Unexpected Pickle Extensions",
  "Description": "Picklescan fails to detect hidden pickle files embedded in PyTorch model archives due to its reliance on file extensions for detection. This allows an attacker to embed a secondary, malicious pickle file with a non-standard extension inside a model archive, which remains undetected by picklescan but is still loaded by PyTorch's torch.load() function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution when the model is loaded.",
