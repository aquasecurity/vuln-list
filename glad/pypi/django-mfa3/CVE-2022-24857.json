  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-24857",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/django-mfa3",
  "Title": "Improper Authentication in django-mfa3",
  "Description": "django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication for the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view. Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed.\n\nYou are affected if you have activated both django-mfa3 (\u003c 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin login view.",
