  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26263",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tlslite-ng",
  "Title": "Inadequate Encryption Strength",
  "Description": "tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext does not start with All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched . Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.",
