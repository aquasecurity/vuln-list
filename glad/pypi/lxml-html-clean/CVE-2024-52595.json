  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-52595",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/lxml-html-clean",
  "Title": "HTML Cleaner allows crafted scripts in special contexts like svg or math to pass through",
  "Description": "The HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `\u003csvg\u003e`, `\u003cmath\u003e` and `\u003cnoscript\u003e`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content.",
