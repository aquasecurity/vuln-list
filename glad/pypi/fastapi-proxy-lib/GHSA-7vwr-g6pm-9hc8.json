  "Title": "Cookie leakage between different users in fastapi-proxy-lib",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn the implementation of version `0.0.1`, requests from different user clients are processed using a shared `httpx.AsyncClient`.\n\nHowever, one oversight is that the `httpx.AsyncClient` will persistently store cookies based on the `set-cookie` response header sent by the target server and share these cookies across different user requests.\n\nThis results in a cookie leakage issue among all user clients sharing the same `httpx.AsyncClient`.\n\n### Patches\n\nIt's fixed in `0.1.0`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you insist `0.0.1`:\n- Do not use `ForwardHttpProxy` at all.\n- Do not use `ReverseHttpProxy` or `ReverseWebSocketProxy` for any servers that may potentially send a `set-cookie` response.\n\n**However, it's best to upgrade to the latest version.**\n\n### References\n\nfixed in [#10](https://github.com/WSH032/fastapi-proxy-lib/pull/10) \n",
