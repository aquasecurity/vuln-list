  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-18920",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/py-evm",
  "Title": "Py-EVM is vulnerable to arbitrary bytecode injection",
  "Description": "Py-EVM v0.2.0-alpha.33 allows attackers to make a vm.execute_bytecode call that triggers computation._stack.values with '\"stack\": [100, 100, 0]' where b'\\x' was expected, resulting in an execution failure because of an invalid opcode. This is reportedly related to \"smart contracts can be executed indefinitely without gas being paid.\"",
