  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-1852",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/keystonemiddleware",
  "Title": "OpenStack keystonemiddleware and python-keystoneclient vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks",
  "Description": "It was discovered that some items in the S3Token paste configuration as used by python-keystonemiddleware (formerly python-keystoneclient) were incorrectly evaluated as strings, an issue similar to CVE-2014-7144. If the \"insecure\" option were set to \"false\", the option would be evaluated as true, resulting in TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Note: the \"insecure\" option defaults to false, so setups that do not specifically define \"insecure=false\" are not affected.",
