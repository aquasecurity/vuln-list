  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54381",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/bentoml",
  "Title": "BentoML SSRF Vulnerability in File Upload Processing  ",
  "Description": "There's an SSRF in the file upload processing system that allows remote attackers to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server without authentication. The vulnerability exists in the serialization/deserialization handlers for multipart form data and JSON requests, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without proper validation of internal network addresses.\n\nThe framework automatically registers any service endpoint with file-type parameters (`pathlib.Path`, `PIL.Image.Image`) as vulnerable to this attack, making it a framework-wide security issue that affects most real-world ML services handling file uploads. While BentoML implements basic URL scheme validation in the `JSONSerde` path, the `MultipartSerde` path has no validation whatsoever, and neither path restricts access to internal networks, cloud metadata endpoints, or localhost services.\n\nThe documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended but insecure design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default.",
