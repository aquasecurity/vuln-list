  "Title": "Invenio-Communities has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in React components",
  "Description": "We have identified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within certain React components related to community members in the Invenio-Communities module. This vulnerability enables a user to inject a script tag into the Affiliations field during the account registration process. The malicious script is executed when the user creates a new community and is listed as a public member.\n\nThe script is triggered whenever any user visits the Members section of any community that includes the compromised user. This can potentially allow the attacker to access personal information, such as cookies, of the visiting user.",
