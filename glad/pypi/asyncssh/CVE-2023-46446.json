  "PackageSlug": "pypi/asyncssh",
  "Title": "AsyncSSH Rogue Session Attack",
  "Description": "An issue in AsyncSSH v2.14.0 and earlier allows attackers to control the remote end of an SSH \nclient session via packet injection/removal and shell emulation.\n\nThe rogue session attack targets any SSH client connecting to an AsyncSSH server, on which the \nattacker must have a shell account. The goal of the attack is to log the client into the attacker's \naccount without the client being able to detect this. At that point, due to how SSH sessions \ninteract with shell environments, the attacker has complete control over the remote end of the SSH \nsession. The attacker receives all keyboard input by the user, completely controls the terminal \noutput of the user's session, can send and receive data to/from forwarded network ports, and is \nable to create signatures with a forwarded SSH Agent, if any. The result is a complete break of the \nconfidentiality and integrity of the secure channel, providing a strong vector for a targeted \nphishing campaign against the user. For example, the attacker can display a password prompt and \nwait for the user to enter the password, elevating the attacker's position to a MitM at the \napplication layer and enabling perfect shell emulation.\n\nThe attacks work by the attacker injecting a chosen authentication request before the client's \nNewKeys. The authentication request sent by the attacker must be a valid authentication request \ncontaining his credentials. The attacker can use any authentication mechanism that does not require \nexchanging additional messages between client and server, such as password or publickey. Due to a \nstate machine flaw, the AsyncSSH server accepts the unauthenticated user authentication request \nmessage and defers it until the client has requested the authentication protocol.\n",
