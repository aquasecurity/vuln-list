  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-0757",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/glance",
  "Title": "Improper Access Control",
  "Description": "An authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered, which allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the last location of an image, an authenticated user could change the status from 'active' to 'queue'. A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to silently replace owned image data, regardless of its original creator or visibility settings. Only environments with show_multiple_locations set to true (not default) were affected.",
