  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24370",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/django-unicorn",
  "Title": "Django-Unicorn Class Pollution Vulnerability, Leading to XSS, DoS and Authentication Bypass",
  "Description": "Django-Unicorn is vulnerable to python class pollution vulnerability, a new type of vulnerability categorized under [CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html). The vulnerability arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which can be remotely triggered by users by crafting appropriate component requests and feeding in values of second and third parameter to the vulnerable function, leading to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status.\n\nAt least five ways of vulnerability exploitation have been found, stably resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass attacks in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application.",
