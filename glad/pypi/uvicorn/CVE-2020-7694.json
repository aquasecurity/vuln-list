  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-7694",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/uvicorn",
  "Title": "Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "The request logger provided by the package is vulnerable to ASNI escape sequence injection. Whenever any HTTP request is received, the default behaviour of uvicorn is to log its details to either the console or a log file. When attackers request crafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging component will log the URL after it's been processed with `urllib.parse.unquote`, therefore converting any percent-encoded characters into their single-character equivalent, which can have special meaning in terminal emulators.",
