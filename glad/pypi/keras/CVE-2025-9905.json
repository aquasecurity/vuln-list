  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-9905",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/keras",
  "Title": "The Keras `Model.load_model` method **silently** ignores `safe_mode=True` and allows arbitrary code execution when a `.h5`/`.hdf5` file is loaded.",
  "Description": "When a model in the `.h5` (or `.hdf5`) format is loaded using the Keras `Model.load_model` method, the `safe_mode=True` setting is **silently** ignored without any warning or error. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine with the same privileges as the Keras application. This report is specific to the `.h5`/`.hdf5` file format. The attack works regardless of the other parameters passed to `load_model` and does not require any sophisticated technique—`.h5` and `.hdf5` files are simply not checked for unsafe code execution.\n\nFrom this point on, I will refer only to the `.h5` file format, though everything equally applies to `.hdf5`.",
