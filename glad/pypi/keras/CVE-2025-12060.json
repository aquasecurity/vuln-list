  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-12060",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/keras",
  "Title": "Keras Directory Traversal Vulnerability",
  "Description": "Keras's `keras.utils.get_file()` function is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks despite implementing `filter_safe_paths()`. The vulnerability exists because `extract_archive()` uses Python's `tarfile.extractall()` method without the security-critical `filter=\"data\"` parameter. A PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug occurs before path filtering, allowing malicious tar archives to bypass security checks and write files outside the intended extraction directory.",
