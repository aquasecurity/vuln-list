  "Title": "Duplicate Advisory: The Keras `Model.load_model` method **silently** ignores `safe_mode=True` and allows arbitrary code execution when a `.h5`/`.hdf5` file is loaded.",
  "Description": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-36rr-ww3j-vrjv. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nThe Keras Model.load_model method can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, even with safe_mode=True.\n\nOne can create a specially crafted .h5/.hdf5 model archive that, when loaded via Model.load_model, will trigger arbitrary code to be executed.\n\nThis is achieved by crafting a special .h5 archive file that uses the Lambda layer feature of keras which allows arbitrary Python code in the form of pickled code. The vulnerability comes from the fact that the safe_mode=True option is not honored when reading .h5 archives.\n\nNote that the .h5/.hdf5 format is a legacy format supported by Keras 3 for backwards compatibility.",
