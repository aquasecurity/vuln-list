  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-12607",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fastecdsa",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in fastecdsa",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in fastecdsa before 2.1.2. When using the NIST P-256 curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at infinity is mishandled. This means that for an extreme value in k and s\u003csup\u003e-1\u003c/sup\u003e, the signature verification fails even if the signature is correct. This behavior is not solely a usability problem. There are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by successfully guessing users for whom signature verification will fail.",
