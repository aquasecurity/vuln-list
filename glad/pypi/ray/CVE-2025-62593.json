  "Title": "Ray is vulnerable to Critical RCE via Safari \u0026 Firefox Browsers through DNS Rebinding Attack",
  "Description": "Developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari.\n\nDue to the longstanding [decision](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-2.51.1/ray-security/index.html) by the Ray Development team to not implement any sort of authentication on critical endpoints, like the `/api/jobs` \u0026 `/api/job_agent/jobs/` has once again led to a severe vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code against Ray. This time in a development context via the browsers Firefox and Safari.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the `User-Agent` header starting with the string \"Mozilla\" as a defense mechanism. This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the `User-Agent` header to be modified.\n\nCombined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, and this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement ([malvertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising)).",
