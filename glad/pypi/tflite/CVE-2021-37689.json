  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37689",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tflite",
  "Title": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. This is caused by the MLIR optimization of `L2NormalizeReduceAxis` operator. The implementation unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking that the vector has elements.",
