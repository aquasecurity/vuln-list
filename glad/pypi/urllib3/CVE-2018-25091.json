  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-25091",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/urllib3",
  "Title": "Authorization Header forwarded on redirect",
  "Description": "urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive).",
