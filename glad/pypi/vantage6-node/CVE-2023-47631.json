  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-47631",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vantage6-node",
  "Title": "vantage6-server node accepts non-allowlisted algorithms from malicious server",
  "Description": "A node does not check if an image is allowed to run if a `parent_id` is set. A malicious party that breaches the server may modify it to set a fake `parent_id` and send a task of a non-allowlisted algorithm. The node will then execute it because the `parent_id` that is set prevents checks from being run. Relevant node code [here](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/blob/version/4.1.1/vantage6-node/vantage6/node/docker/docker_manager.py#L265-L268)\n\nThis impacts all servers that are breached by an expert user",
