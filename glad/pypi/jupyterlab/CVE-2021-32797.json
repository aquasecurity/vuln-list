  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32797",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyterlab",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. JupyterLab doesnâ€™t sanitize the action attribute of html `\u003cform\u003e`. Using this, it is possible to trigger the form validation outside of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.",
