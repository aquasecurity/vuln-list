  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41194",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator",
  "Title": "Improper Access Control",
  "Description": "FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticat If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.",
