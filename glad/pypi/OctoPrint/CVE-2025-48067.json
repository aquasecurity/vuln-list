  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-48067",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/OctoPrint",
  "Title": "OctoPrint vulnerable to possible file extraction via upload endpoints",
  "Description": "OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.1 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker with the `FILE_UPLOAD` permission to exfiltrate files from the host that OctoPrint has read access to, by moving them into the upload folder where they then can be downloaded from.\n\nThe primary risk lies in the potential exfiltration of secrets stored inside OctoPrint's config, or further system files. By removing important runtime files, this could also be used to impact the availability of the host. Given that the attacker requires a user account with file upload permissions, the actual impact of this should however hopefully be minimal in most cases.",
