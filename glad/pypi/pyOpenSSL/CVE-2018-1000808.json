  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-1000808",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pyOpenSSL",
  "Title": "Pyopenssl Incorrect Memory Management",
  "Description": "It was discovered that pyOpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when performing operations on a PKCS #12 store. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause pyOpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nThis attack appear to be exploitable via Depends upon calling application, however it could be as simple as initiating a TLS connection that would cause the calling application to reload certificates from a PKCS #12 store. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 17.5.0.",
