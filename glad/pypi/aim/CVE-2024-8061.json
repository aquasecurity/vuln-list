  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-8061",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/aim",
  "Title": "Aim allows denial of service due to no timeouts for some tracking server endpoints",
  "Description": "In version 3.23.0 of aimhubio/aim, certain methods that request data from external servers do not have set timeouts, causing the server to wait indefinitely for a response. This can lead to a denial of service, as the tracking server does not respond to other requests while waiting. The issue arises in the client used by the `aim` tracking server to communicate with external resources, specifically in the `_run_read_instructions` method and similar calls without timeouts.",
