  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32677",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fastapi",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FastAPI",
  "Description": "FastAPI versions lower than `0.65.2` that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.\n\nIn versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. `application/geo+json`).\n\nSo, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.\n\nBut requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.",
