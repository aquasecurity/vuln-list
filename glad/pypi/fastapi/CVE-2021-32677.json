  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32677",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fastapi",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.",
