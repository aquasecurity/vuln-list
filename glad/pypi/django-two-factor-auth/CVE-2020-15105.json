  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15105",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/django-two-factor-auth",
  "Title": "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information",
  "Description": "Django Two-Factor Authentication All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading.",
