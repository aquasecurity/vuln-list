  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29430",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-sydent",
  "Title": "Sydent vulnerable to denial of service attack via memory exhaustion",
  "Description": "Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to disk space exhaustion and denial of service.\n\nSydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.\n\nThis affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients.",
