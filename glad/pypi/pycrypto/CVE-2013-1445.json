  "Identifier": "CVE-2013-1445",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pycrypto",
  "Title": "PyCrypto does not properly reseed PRNG before allowing access",
  "Description": "The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.",
