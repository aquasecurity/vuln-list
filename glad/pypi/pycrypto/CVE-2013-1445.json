  "Identifier": "CVE-2013-1445",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pycrypto",
  "Title": "Cryptographic Issues",
  "Description": "The `Crypto.Random.atfork` function in PyCrypto does not properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.",
