  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21239",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pysaml2",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature",
  "Description": "PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend is using the `xmlsec1` binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default `xmlsec1` accepts any type of key found within the given document. `xmlsec1` needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 ",
