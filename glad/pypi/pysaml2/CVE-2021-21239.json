  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21239",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pysaml2",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in PySAML2",
  "Description": "All users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 \u003c= 6.4.1` does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend is using the `xmlsec1` binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default, `xmlsec1` accepts any type of key found within the given document. `xmlsec1` needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature.",
