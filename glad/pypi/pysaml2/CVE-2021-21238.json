  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21238",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pysaml2",
  "Title": "SAML XML Signature wrapping in PySAML2",
  "Description": "All users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 \u003c= 6.4.1` does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allows invalid XML documents to trick the verification process, by presenting elements with a valid signature inside elements whose content has been malformed. The verification is offloaded to `xmlsec1` and `xmlsec1` will not validate every signature in the given document, but only the first it finds in the given scope.",
