  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pysaml2",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature",
  "Description": "PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 ",
