  "Title": "AWS SageMaker Training Toolkit logs CodeArtifact Authorization token",
  "Description": "For SageMaker Training Toolkit[1] versions 4.7.4; 4.7.3; 4.7.2; 4.7.1; 4.7.0, the authorization tokens for CodeArtifact (temporary token with an expiration of 12 hours) were logged in the log files when the CodeArtifact capability was enabled. If customers push these log files to their CloudWatch Log streams, anyone having access to cloudwatch logs within their AWS account, may be abe to see the authorization token. If the token is not expired, they may use the authorization token to publish or consume CodeArtifact package versions.\n\nThis issue was addressed in version 4.8.0. We recommend users upgrade to version 4.8.0 or higher.\n\nPlease note that users can add SageMaker Training Toolkit to any Docker container[2] used for SageMaker training[3]. It also comes pre-packaged with the prebuilt SageMaker Docker image[4] for SageMaker training.",
