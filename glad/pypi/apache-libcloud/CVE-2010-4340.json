  "PackageSlug": "pypi/apache-libcloud",
  "Title": "Apache Libcloud does not verify SSL certificates for HTTPS connections",
  "Description": "libcloud before 0.4.0 does not verify SSL certificates for HTTPS connections, which allows remote attackers to spoof certificates and bypass intended access restrictions via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This is due to an upstream issue with python's SSL module rather than directly with libcloud.",
