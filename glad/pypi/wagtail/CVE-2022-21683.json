  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-21683",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/wagtail",
  "Title": "Comment reply notifications sent to incorrect users",
  "Description": "When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies on pages they have not had editing access to, as long as they have left a comment or reply somewhere on the site.",
