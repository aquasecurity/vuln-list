{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32681",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/wagtail",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting in wagtail",
  "Description": "When the `{% include_block %}` template tag is used to output the value of a plain-text StreamField block (`CharBlock`, `TextBlock` or a similar user-defined block derived from `FieldBlock`), and that block does not specify a template for rendering, the tag output is not properly escaped as HTML. This could allow users to insert arbitrary HTML or scripting. This vulnerability is only exploitable by users with the ability to author StreamField content (i.e. users with 'editor' access to the Wagtail admin).",
