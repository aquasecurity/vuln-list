  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-39317",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/wagtail",
  "Title": "Wagtail regular expression denial-of-service via search query parsing",
  "Description": "A bug in Wagtail's [`parse_query_string`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/search/searching.html#wagtailsearch-query-string-parsing) would result in it taking a long time to process suitably crafted inputs. When used to parse sufficiently long strings of characters without a space, `parse_query_string` would take an unexpectedly large amount of time to process, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nIn an initial Wagtail installation, the vulnerability can be exploited by any Wagtail admin user. It cannot be exploited by end users. If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users).",
