  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29434",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/wagtail",
  "Title": "Improper validation of URLs ('Cross-site Scripting') in Wagtail rich text fields",
  "Description": "When saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface, Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.",
