  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-3840",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/antilles-tools",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Search Path Element",
  "Description": "A dependency confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source software that could allow for remote code execution during installation due to a package listed in requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi). MITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi. The configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi.",
