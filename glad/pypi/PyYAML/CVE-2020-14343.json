  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-14343",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/PyYAML",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the `full_load` method or with the `FullLoader` loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the `python/object/new` constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747.",
