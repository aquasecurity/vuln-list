  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-45083",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Cobbler",
  "Title": "Incorrect Default Permissions",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The `users.digest` file contains the `sha2-512` digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. The `settings.yaml` file contains secrets such as the hashed default password.",
