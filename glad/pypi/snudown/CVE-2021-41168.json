  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41168",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/snudown",
  "Title": "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "Description": "References written in markdown are inserted into a hash table which was found to have a weak hash function, meaning that an attacker can reliably generate a large number of collisions for it. This makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision DoS attack, a type of algorithmic complexity attack. Further the hash table allowed for duplicate entries resulting in long retrieval times.",
