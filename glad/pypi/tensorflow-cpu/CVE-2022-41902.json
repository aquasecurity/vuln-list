  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-41902",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Out of bounds write in grappler in Tensorflow",
  "Description": "### Impact\nThe function [MakeGrapplerFunctionItem](https://https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/utils/functions.cc#L221) takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7) .\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n",
