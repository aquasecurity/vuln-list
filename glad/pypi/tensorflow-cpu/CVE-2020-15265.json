  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15265",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, an attacker can pass an invalid `axis` value to `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`. This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the C++ kernel implementation. However, `dim_size` only does a `DCHECK` to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array. Since in normal builds, `DCHECK`-like macros are no-ops, this results in segfault and access out-of-bounds of the array.",
