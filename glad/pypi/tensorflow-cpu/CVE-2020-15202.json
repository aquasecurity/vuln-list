  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15202",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the Shard API in TensorFlow expects the last argument to be a function taking two `int64` arguments. However, there are several places in TensorFlow where a lambda taking `int` or `int32` arguments is being used. In these cases, if the amount of work to be parallelized is large enough, integer truncation occurs. Depending on how the two arguments of the lambda are used, this can result in segfaults, read/write outside heap allocated arrays, stack overflows, or data corruption.",
