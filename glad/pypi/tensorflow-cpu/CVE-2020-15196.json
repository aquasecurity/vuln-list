  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15196",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Heap buffer overflow in Tensorflow",
  "Description": "The `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementations don't validate that the `weights` tensor has the same shape as the data. The check exists for `DenseCountSparseOutput`, where both tensors are fully specified:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L110-L117\n\nIn the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel with the data:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L199-L201\n\nBut, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than the values for the tensors can generate a read from outside the bounds of the heap buffer allocated for the weights.",
