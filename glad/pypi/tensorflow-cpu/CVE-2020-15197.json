{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15197",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `indices` tensor has rank This tensor must be a matrix because code assumes its elements are accessed as elements of a matrix. However, malicious users can pass in tensors of different rank, resulting in a `CHECK` assertion failure and a crash. This can be used to cause denial of service in serving installations, if users are allowed to control the components of the input sparse tensor.",
