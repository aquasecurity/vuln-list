  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41198",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Overflow/crash in `tf.tile` when tiling tensor is large",
  "Description": "If `tf.tile` is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\ntf.keras.backend.tile(x=np.ones((1,1,1)), n=[100000000,100000000, 100000000])\n```\n\nThe number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the `int64_t` type and the overflow is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This aborts the process.",
