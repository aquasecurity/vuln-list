  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23591",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Stack overflow in TensorFlow",
  "Description": "The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`:\n\n```\nlibrary {\nfunction {\nsignature {\nname: \"SomeOp\"\ndescription: \"Self recursive op\"\n}\nnode_def {\nname: \"1\"\nop: \"SomeOp\"\n}\nnode_def {\nname: \"2\"\nop: \"SomeOp\"\n}\n}\n}\n```\n\nThis would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes.",
