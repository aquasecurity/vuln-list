  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16778",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Heap buffer overflow in `UnsortedSegmentSum` in TensorFlow",
  "Description": "A heap buffer overflow in `UnsortedSegmentSum` can be produced when the `Index` template argument is `int32`. In this case `data_size` and `num_segments` fields are truncated from `int64` to `int32` and can produce negative numbers, resulting in accessing out of bounds heap memory.\n\nThis is unlikely to be exploitable and was detected and fixed internally. We are making the security advisory only to notify users that it is better to update to TensorFlow 1.15 or 2.0 or later as these versions already have this fixed.",
