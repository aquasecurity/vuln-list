  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41197",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-cpu",
  "Title": "Crashes due to overflow and `CHECK`-fail in ops with large tensor shapes",
  "Description": "TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions and each dimension can be as large as desired. However, the total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary.",
