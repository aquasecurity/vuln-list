  "Title": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound in TensorFlow",
  "Description": "### Impact\nThe Grappler component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via `CHECK`-failure  in constant folding  for ;\n    // ...\n  }\n```\n  \nThe `output_prop` tensor has a shape that is controlled by user input and this can result in triggering one of the `CHECK`s in the `PartialTensorShape` constructor. This is an instance of TFSA-2021-198 .\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit be7b286d40bc68cb0b56f702186cc4837d508058 fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide] for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.",
