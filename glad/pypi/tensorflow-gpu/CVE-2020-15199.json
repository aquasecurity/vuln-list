{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15199",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system.",
