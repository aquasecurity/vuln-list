  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15207",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
  "Description": "In tensorflow-lite, to mimic Python's indexing with negative values, TFLite uses `ResolveAxis` to convert negative values to positive indices. However, the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds. If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative index. This, in turn, results in accessing data out-of-bounds which results in segfaults `and/or` data corruption.",
