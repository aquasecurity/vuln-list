  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29568",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Access of Uninitialized Pointer",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger undefined behavior by binding to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`. This is because the implementation does not validate input arguments before accessing the first element of `shape`. If `shape` argument is empty, then `shape_tensor.flat\u003cT\u003e` is an empty array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
