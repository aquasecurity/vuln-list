  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29615",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Recursion",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `ParseAttrValue` can be tricked into stack overflow due to recursion by giving in a specially crafted input. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
