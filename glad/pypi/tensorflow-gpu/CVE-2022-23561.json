  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23561",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Out of bounds write in TFLite",
  "Description": "An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array in TFLite. In fact, the attacker can override the linked list used by the memory allocator. This can be leveraged for an arbitrary write primitive under certain conditions.",
