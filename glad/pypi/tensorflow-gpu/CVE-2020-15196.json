{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15196",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementations don't validate that the `weights` tensor has the same shape as the data. The check exists for `DenseCountSparseOutput`, where both tensors are fully specified. In the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel with the data. But, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than the values for the tensors can generate a read from outside the bounds of the heap buffer allocated for the weights.",
