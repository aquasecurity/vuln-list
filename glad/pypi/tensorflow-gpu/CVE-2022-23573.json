  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23573",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Uninitialized variable access in Tensorflow",
  "Description": "The [implementation of `AssignOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/assign_op.h#L30-L143) can result in copying unitialized data to a new tensor. This later results in undefined behavior.\n\nThe implementation has a check that the left hand side of the assignment is initialized (to minimize number of allocations), but does not check that the right hand side is also initialized.",
