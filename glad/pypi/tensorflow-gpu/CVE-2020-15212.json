{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15212",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "In TensorFlow Lite, models using segment sum can trigger writes outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers by inserting negative elements in the segment ids tensor. Users having access to `segment_ids_data` can alter `output_index` and then write to outside `output_data` buffer. This might result in a segmentation fault but it can also be used to further corrupt the memory and can be chained with other vulnerabilities to create more advanced exploits.",
