  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23593",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions",
  "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast` function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault , if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.",
