  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15193",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Use of Uninitialized Resource",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the implementation of `dlpack.to_dlpack` can be made to use uninitialized memory resulting in further memory corruption. This is because the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor. The uninitialized memory address is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since the `PyObject` is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast to `EagerTensor` fails.",
