  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-29205",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Use of Uninitialized Resource",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, there is a potential for segfault / denial of service in TensorFlow by calling `tf.compat.v1.*` ops which don't yet have support for quantized types, which was added after migration to TensorFlow 2.x. In these scenarios, since the kernel is missing, a `nullptr` value is passed to `ParseDimensionValue` for the `py_value` argument. Then, this is dereferenced, resulting in segfault. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.",
