  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-5215",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Segmentation faultin TensorFlow when converting a Python string to `tf.float16`",
  "Description": "Converting a string (from Python) to a `tf.float16` value results in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case are only in the graph mode.\n\nThis issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a `tf.float16` value.\n\nSimilar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar `tf.float16` value with a scalar string will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions.\n\nThis can be easily reproduced by `tf.constant(\"hello\", tf.float16)`, if eager execution is enabled.",
