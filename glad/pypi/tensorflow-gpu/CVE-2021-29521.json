  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29521",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow-gpu",
  "Title": "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Specifying a negative dense shape in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results in a segmentation fault being thrown out from the standard library as `std::vector` invariants are broken. This is because the implementation assumes the first element of the dense shape is always positive and uses it to initialize a `BatchedMap\u003cT\u003e` data structure. If the `shape` tensor has more than one element, `num_batches` is the first value in `shape`. Ensuring that the `dense_shape` argument is a valid tensor shape  solves this issue. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3.",
