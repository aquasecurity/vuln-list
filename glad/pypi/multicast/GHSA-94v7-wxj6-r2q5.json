  "Title": "multicast in source builds from vulnerable setuptools dependency",
  "Description": "* Some source-builds may be impacted by a CWE-1395 (eg. vulnerable `setuptools` dependency).\n* Multicast prior to v2.0.9a3 on systems with minimal dependancies installed may use `setuptools \u003c78.1.1` and thus rely on a compromised dependency. In some cases there is a chance that source-builds would fail due to an exploit of the closely related CVE-2025-47273, or become arbitrarily modified.",
