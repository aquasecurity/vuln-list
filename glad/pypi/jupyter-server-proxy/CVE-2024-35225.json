  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-35225",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyter-server-proxy",
  "Title": "Jupyter Server Proxy has a reflected XSS issue in host parameter",
  "Description": "There is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in `jupyter-server-proxy`[1]. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/\u003chost\u003e`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/\u003chost\u003e`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor.\nAs any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. This issue exists in the latest release of `jupyter-server-proxy`, currently `v4.1.2`.\n**Impacted versions:** `\u003e=3.0.0,\u003c=4.1.2`",
