  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28179",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyter-server-proxy",
  "Title": "Jupyter Server Proxy's Websocket Proxying does not require authentication",
  "Description": "`jupyter-server-proxy` is used to expose ports local to a Jupyter server listening to web traffic to the Jupyter server's _authenticated users_ by proxying web requests and websockets. Dependent packages ([partial list](https://www.wheelodex.org/projects/jupyter-server-proxy/rdepends/)) also use `jupyter-server-proxy` to expose other popular interactive applications (such as [RStudio](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-rsession-proxy), [Linux Desktop via VNC](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy), [Code Server](https://github.com/betatim/vscode-binder), [Panel](https://github.com/holoviz/jupyter-panel-proxy), etc) along with the Jupyter server. This feature is commonly used in hosted environments (such as a JupyterHub) to expose non-Jupyter interactive frontends or APIs to the user.\n\n`jupyter-server-proxy` did not check user authentication appropriately when proxying websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network access to the Jupyter server endpoint.",
