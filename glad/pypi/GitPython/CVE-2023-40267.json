  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-40267",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/GitPython",
  "Title": "GitPython vulnerable to remote code execution due to insufficient sanitization of input arguments",
  "Description": "GitPython before 3.1.32 does not block insecure non-multi options in `clone` and `clone_from`, making it vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-24439.",
