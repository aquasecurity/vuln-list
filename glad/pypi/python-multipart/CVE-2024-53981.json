{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-53981",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/python-multipart",
  "Title": "Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary",
  "Description": "When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
