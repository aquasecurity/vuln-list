  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-58438",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/internetarchive",
  "Title": "internetarchive Vulnerable to Directory Traversal in File.download()",
  "Description": "**What kind of vulnerability is it?**\nThis is a **Critical** severity directory traversal (path traversal) vulnerability in the `File.download()` method of the `internetarchive` library.\n\n**Who is impacted?**\nAll users of the `internetarchive` library versions `\u003c 5.5.1` are impacted. The vulnerability is particularly critical for users on **Windows systems**, but all operating systems are affected.\n\n**Description of the vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability existed because the `file.download()` method did not properly sanitize user-supplied filenames or validate the final download path. A maliciously crafted filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../windows/system32/file.txt`) or illegal characters that, when processed, would cause the file to be written outside of the intended target directory.\n\n**Potential Impact:**\nAn attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or application configuration files, leading to a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution, depending on the context in which the library is used.",
