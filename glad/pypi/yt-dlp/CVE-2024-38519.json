  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-38519",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/yt-dlp",
  "Title": "yt-dlp File system modification and RCE through improper file-extension sanitization",
  "Description": "`yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.",
