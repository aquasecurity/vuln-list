  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-47287",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tornado",
  "Title": "Tornado vulnerable to excessive logging caused by malformed multipart form data",
  "Description": "When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs, constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous.",
