  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6971",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/lollms",
  "Title": "Lord of Large Language Models (LoLLMs) Server path traversal vulnerability in lollms_file_system.py",
  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the ParisNeo/lollms repository, specifically in the `lollms_file_system.py` file. The functions `add_rag_database`, `toggle_mount_rag_database`, and `vectorize_folder` do not implement security measures such as `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` or `sanitize_path`. This allows an attacker to perform vectorize operations on `.sqlite` files in any directory on the victim's computer, potentially installing multiple packages and causing a crash.",
