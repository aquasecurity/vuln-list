  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6581",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/lollms",
  "Title": "Lollms vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "A vulnerability in the discussion image upload function of the Lollms application, version v9.9, allows for the uploading of SVG files. Due to incomplete filtering in the sanitize_svg function, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which in turn pose a risk of remote code execution. The sanitize_svg function only removes script elements and 'on*' event attributes, but does not account for other potential vectors for XSS within SVG files. This vulnerability can be exploited when authorized users access a malicious URL containing the crafted SVG file.",
