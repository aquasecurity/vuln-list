  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-6982",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/lollms",
  "Title": "LoLLMS Code Injection vulnerability",
  "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Calculate function of parisneo/lollms version 9.8. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's `eval()` function to evaluate mathematical expressions within a Python sandbox that disables `__builtins__` and only allows functions from the `math` module. This sandbox can be bypassed by loading the `os` module using the `_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter` class, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The issue is fixed in version 9.10.",
