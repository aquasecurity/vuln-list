  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-13177",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/django-rest-registration",
  "Title": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in django-rest-registration",
  "Description": "The vulnerability is a high severity one. Anyone using Django REST Registration library versions `0.2.*` - `0.4.*` with e-mail verification option (which is recommended, but needs [additional configuration](https://django-rest-registration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#preferred-configuration)) is affected.\nIn the worst case, the attacker can take over any Django user by resetting his/her password without even receiving the reset password verification link, just by guessing the signature from publicly available data (more detailed description below).",
