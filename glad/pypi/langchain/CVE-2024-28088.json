  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28088",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/langchain",
  "Title": "LangChain directory traversal vulnerability",
  "Description": "LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor who is able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call. This bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language model online service, or remote code execution.",
