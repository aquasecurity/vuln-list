  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tenable-jira-cloud",
  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "In tenable-jira-cloud, it is possible to run arbitrary commands through the `yaml.load()` method. This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file. This is fixed by using `yaml.safe_load()` instead of `yaml.load()`.",
