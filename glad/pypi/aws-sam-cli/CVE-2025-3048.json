  "PackageSlug": "pypi/aws-sam-cli",
  "Title": "AWS SAM CLI Path Traversal allows file copy to local cache",
  "Description": "The [AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/using-sam-cli.html) is an open-source CLI tool that helps Lambda developers to build and develop Lambda applications locally on their computers using Docker.\n\nAfter completing a build with AWS SAM CLI which include symlinks, the content of those symlinks are copied to the cache of the local workspace as regular files or directories. As a result, a user who does not have access to those symlinks outside of the Docker container would now have access via the local workspace.\n\nUsers should [upgrade to v1.134.0 or newer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/manage-sam-cli-versions.html#manage-sam-cli-versions-upgrade) and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. After upgrading, users must re-build their applications using the `sam build --use-container` to update the symlinks.",
