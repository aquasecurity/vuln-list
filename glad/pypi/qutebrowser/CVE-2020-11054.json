{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-11054",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/qutebrowser",
  "Title": "Incorrect Provision of Specified Functionality in qutebrowser",
  "Description": "After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`). However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https`). While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set `content.ssl_strict` to `false` which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security.",
