  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27154",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/spotipy",
  "Title": "Spotipy's cache file, containing spotify auth token, is created with overly broad permissions",
  "Description": "The `CacheHandler` class creates a cache file to store the auth token here: https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/cache_handler.py#L93-L98\n\nThe file created has `rw-r--r--` (644) permissions by default, when it could be locked down to `rw-------` (600) permissions. I think `600` is a sensible default.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b7ebbc1-a27a-4528-ab6a-135c7886766a)",
