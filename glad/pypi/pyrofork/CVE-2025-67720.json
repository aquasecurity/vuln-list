  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pyrofork",
  "Title": "Pyrofork has a Path Traversal in download_media Method",
  "Description": "The `download_media` method in Pyrofork does not sanitize filenames received from Telegram messages before using them in file path construction. This allows a remote attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem by sending a specially crafted document with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) or absolute paths in the filename.\n\n---",
