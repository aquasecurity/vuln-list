{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32633",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/zope",
  "Title": "Remote Code Execution via traversal in TAL expressions",
  "Description": "Most Python modules are not available for using in TAL expressions that you can add through-the-web, for example in Zope Page Templates. This restriction avoids file system access, for example via the 'os' module. But some of the untrusted modules are available indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use.\n\nBy default, you need to have the Manager role to add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the web are at risk.",
