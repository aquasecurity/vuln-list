  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32674",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/zope",
  "Title": "Path Traversal",
  "Description": "Zope is an open-source web application server. This advisory extends the previous advisory at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36. Most Python modules are not available for using in TAL expressions that you can add through-the-web, for example in `Zope Page Templates`. This restriction avoids file system access, for example via the `os` module. But some of the untrusted modules are available indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use. By default, you need to have the `Manager` role to add or edit `Zope Page Templates` through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit `Zope Page Templates` through the web are at risk.",
