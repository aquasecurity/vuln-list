  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-20225",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pip",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the `--extra-index-url` option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number).",
