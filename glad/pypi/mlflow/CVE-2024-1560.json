  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-1560",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/mlflow",
  "Title": "mlflow vulnerable to Path Traversal",
  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the artifact deletion functionality. Attackers can bypass path validation by exploiting the double decoding process in the `_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts` handler and `local_file_uri_to_path` function, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem. This vulnerability is due to an extra unquote operation in the `delete_artifacts` function of `local_artifact_repo.py`, which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths. The issue is present up to version 2.9.2, despite attempts to fix a similar issue in CVE-2023-6831.",
