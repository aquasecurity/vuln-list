  "Title": "LangGraph Checkpoint affected by RCE in \"json\" mode of JsonPlusSerializer ",
  "Description": "Prior to `langgraph-checkpoint` version `3.0` , LangGraph’s `JsonPlusSerializer` (used as the default serialization protocol for all checkpointing) contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability when deserializing payloads saved in the `\"json\"` serialization mode.\n\nIf an attacker can cause your application to persist a payload serialized in this mode, they may be able to also send malicious content that executes arbitrary Python code during deserialization.\n\nUpgrading to version langgraph-checkpoint `3.0` patches this vulnerability by preventing deserialization of custom objects saved in this mode.\n\nIf you are deploying in `langgraph-api`, any version `0.5` or later is also free of this vulnerability.",
