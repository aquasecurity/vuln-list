  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-61622",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pyfury",
  "Title": "Apache Pyfory python is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data",
  "Description": "Deserialization of untrusted data in python in pyfory versions 0.12.0 through 0.12.2, or the legacy pyfury versions from 0.1.0 through 0.10.3: allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources. An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is vulnerable to remote code execution.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.",
