  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-53354",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/nicegui",
  "Title": "NiceGUI has a Reflected XSS",
  "Description": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risk exists in NiceGUI when developers render unescaped user input into the DOM using `ui.html()`. Before version 3.0, NiceGUI does not enforce HTML or JavaScript sanitization, so applications that directly combine components like `ui.input()` with `ui.html()` without escaping may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s browser. Same holds for `ui.chat_message` with HTML content.\n\nApplications that directly reflect user input via `ui.html()` (or `ui.chat_message` in HTML mode) are affected. This may lead to client-side code execution (e.g., session hijacking or phishing). Applications that do not pass untrusted input into ui.html() are not affected.",
