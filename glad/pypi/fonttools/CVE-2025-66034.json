  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66034",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fonttools",
  "Title": "fontTools is Vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write and XML injection in fontTools.varLib",
  "Description": "The `fonttools varLib` (or `python3 -m fontTools.varLib`) script has an arbitrary file write vulnerability that leads to remote code execution when a malicious .designspace file is processed. The vulnerability affects the `main()` code path of `fontTools.varLib`, used by the fonttools varLib CLI and any code that invokes `fontTools.varLib.main()`.\n\nThe vulnerability exists due to unsanitised filename handling combined with content injection. Attackers can write files to arbitrary filesystem locations via path traversal sequences, and inject malicious code (like PHP) into the output files through XML injection in labelname elements. When these files are placed in web-accessible locations and executed, this achieves remote code execution without requiring any elevated privileges. Once RCE is obtained, attackers can further escalate privileges to compromise system files (like overwriting `/etc/passwd`).\n\nOverall this allows attackers to:\n- Write font files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem\n- Overwrite configuration files\n- Corrupt application files and dependencies\n- Obtain remote code execution\n\nThe attacker controls the file location, extension and contents which could lead to remote code execution as well as enabling a denial of service through file corruption means.",
