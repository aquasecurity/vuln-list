  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-48995",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/signxml",
  "Title": "SignXML's signature verification with HMAC is vulnerable to a timing attack",
  "Description": "When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`), prior versions of SignXML are vulnerable to a potential timing attack. The verifier may leak information about the correct HMAC when comparing it with the user supplied hash, allowing users to reconstruct the correct HMAC for any data.",
