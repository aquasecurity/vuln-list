  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68664",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/langchain-core",
  "Title": "LangChain serialization injection vulnerability enables secret extraction in dumps/loads APIs",
  "Description": "A serialization injection vulnerability exists in LangChain's `dumps()` and `dumpd()` functions. The functions do not escape dictionaries with `'lc'` keys when serializing free-form dictionaries. The `'lc'` key is used internally by LangChain to mark serialized objects. When user-controlled data contains this key structure, it is treated as a legitimate LangChain object during deserialization rather than plain user data.",
