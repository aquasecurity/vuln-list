  "PackageSlug": "pypi/langchain-core",
  "Title": "LangChain's XMLOutputParser vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion",
  "Description": "The XMLOutputParser in LangChain uses the etree module from the XML parser in the standard python library which has some XML vulnerabilities; see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html\n\nThis primarily affects users that combine an LLM (or agent) with the `XMLOutputParser` and expose the component via an endpoint on a web-service.\n\nThis would allow a malicious party to attempt to manipulate the LLM to produce a malicious payload for the parser that would compromise the availability of the service.\n\nA successful attack is predicated on:\n\n1. Usage of XMLOutputParser\n2. Passing of malicious input into the XMLOutputParser either directly or by trying to manipulate an LLM to do so on the users behalf\n3. Exposing the component via a web-service",
