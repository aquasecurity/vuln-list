  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-64512",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pdfminer.six",
  "Title": "Arbitrary Code Execution in pdfminer.six via Crafted PDF Input",
  "Description": "pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed.",
