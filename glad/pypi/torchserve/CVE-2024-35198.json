{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-35198",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/torchserve",
  "Title": "TorchServe vulnerable to bypass of allowed_urls configuration",
  "Description": "TorchServe's check on allowed_urls configuration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as \"..\" but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls security check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.",
