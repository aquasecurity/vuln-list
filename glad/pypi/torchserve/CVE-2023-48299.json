  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-48299",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/torchserve",
  "Title": "TorchServe ZipSlip",
  "Description": "### Impact\nUsing the model/workflow management API, there is a chance of uploading potentially harmful archives that contain files that are extracted to any location on the filesystem that is within the process permissions. Leveraging this issue could aid third-party actors in hiding harmful code in open-source/public models, which can be downloaded from the internet, and take advantage of machines running Torchserve.\n\n### Patches\nThe ZipSlip issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the paths of files contained within a zip archive before extracting them: https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2634\n\nTorchServe release 0.9.0 includes fixes to address the ZipSlip vulnerability:\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.9.0\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2634\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.9.0\n\n### Credit\nWe would like to thank Oligo Security for responsibly disclosing this issue.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, we ask that you contact AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
