  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16784",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/PyInstaller",
  "Title": "Improper Privilege Management",
  "Description": "In PyInstaller before version, only on Windows, a local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in this particular case. A software using PyInstaller in `onefile` mode can be launched by a privileged user (at least more than the current one) so that `TempPath` may become a world writable directory. This is the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account. In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).",
