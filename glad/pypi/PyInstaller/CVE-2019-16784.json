  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16784",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/PyInstaller",
  "Title": "Local Privilege Escalation in PyInstaller",
  "Description": "Local Privilege Escalation in all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode.\n\nThe vulnerability is present only on Windows and in this particular case: If a **software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode** is launched by a (privileged) user who has **his/her \"TempPath\" resolving to a world writable directory**. This is the case e.g. if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (in which case TempPath will default to C:\\Windows\\Temp).\n\nIn order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker has launched the exploit program. So for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).\n\nWhile PyInstaller itself was not vulnerable, all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode is vulnerable.\n\nCVSSv3 score 7.0 (High)\nCVSSv3 vector CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nAffected\n- all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode\n\nNo affected\n- PyInstaller itself (except if frozen by PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode on Windows)\n- software frozen in \"one*dir*\" mode\n- other platforms (GNU/Linux, OS X, BSD, etc.)",
