  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16785",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/waitress",
  "Title": "HTTP Request Smuggling: LF vs CRLF handling in Waitress",
  "Description": "Waitress implemented a \u0026amp;quot;MAY\u0026amp;quot; part of the RFC7230 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n\nAlthough the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\nthe sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\nterminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n\nUnfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nContent-Length: 100[CRLF]\nX-Header: x[LF]Content-Length: 0[CRLF]\n```\n\nWould get treated by Waitress as if it were:\n\n```\nContent-Length: 100\nX-Header: x\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThis could potentially get used by attackers to split the HTTP request and smuggle a second request in the body of the first.",
