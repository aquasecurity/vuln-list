  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16785",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/waitress",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)",
  "Description": "Waitress implemented an optional part of the RFC7230 which states: \"Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient may recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.",
