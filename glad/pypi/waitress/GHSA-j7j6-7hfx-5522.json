  "Description": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-36p8-mvp6-cv38. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nWaitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.",
