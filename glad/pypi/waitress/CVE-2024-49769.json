  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-49769",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/waitress",
  "Title": "Waitress vulnerable to DoS leading to high CPU usage/resource exhaustion",
  "Description": "When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call `getpeername()` waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function.\n\nA remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required.",
