  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-5236",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/waitress",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Waitress version allows a DoS attack when waitress receives a header that contains invalid characters. When a header similar to `Bad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\x10` is received, it will cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use % CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the service offline.",
