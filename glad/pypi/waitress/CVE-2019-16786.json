  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16786",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/waitress",
  "Title": "HTTP Request Smuggling: Invalid Transfer-Encoding in Waitress",
  "Description": "Waitress would parse the `Transfer-Encoding` header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not `chunked` it would fall through and use the `Content-Length` header instead.\n\nAccording to the HTTP standard `Transfer-Encoding` should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with `chunked`.\n\nRequests sent with:\n\n```\nTransfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\n```\n\nWould incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a `Content-Length` header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message.\n\nThis could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.",
