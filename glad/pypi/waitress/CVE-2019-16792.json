  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-16792",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/waitress",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)",
  "Description": "Waitress allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two `Content-Length` headers are sent in a single request, Waitress treats the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.",
