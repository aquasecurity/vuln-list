  "PackageSlug": "pypi/langflow",
  "Title": "External Control of File Name or Path in Langflow",
  "Description": "**Vulnerability Overview**\n\nIf an arbitrary path is specified in the request body's `fs_path`, the server serializes the Flow object into JSON and creates/overwrites a file at that path. There is no path restriction, normalization, or allowed directory enforcement, so absolute paths (e.g., /etc/poc.txt) are interpreted as is.\n\n**Vulnerable Code**\n\n1. It receives the request body (flow), updates the DB, and then passes it to the file-writing sink.",
