  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-68477",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/langflow",
  "Title": "Langflow vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery",
  "Description": "**Vulnerability Overview**\n\n\nLangflow provides an API Request component that can issue arbitrary HTTP requests within a flow. This component takes a user-supplied URL, performs only normalization and basic format checks, and then sends the request using a server-side httpx client. It does not block private IP ranges (127.0.0.1, the 10/172/192 ranges) or cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), and it returns the response body as the result.\n\nBecause the flow execution endpoints (/api/v1/run, /api/v1/run/advanced) can be invoked with just an API key, if an attacker can control the API Request URL in a flow, non-blind SSRF is possible—accessing internal resources from the server’s network context. This enables requests to, and collection of responses from, internal administrative endpoints, metadata services, and internal databases/services, leading to information disclosure and providing a foothold for further attacks.\n\n**Vulnerable Code**\n\n1. When a flow runs, the API Request URL is set via user input or tweaks, or it falls back to the value stored in the node UI.",
