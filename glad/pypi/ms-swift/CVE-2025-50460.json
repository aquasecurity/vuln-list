  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-50460",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ms-swift",
  "Title": "MS SWIFT Remote Code Execution via unsafe PyYAML deserialization",
  "Description": "A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the [modelscope/ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) project due to unsafe use of `yaml.load()` in combination with vulnerable versions of the PyYAML library (â‰¤ 5.3.1). The issue resides in the `tests/run.py` script, where a user-supplied YAML configuration file is deserialized using `yaml.load()` with `yaml.FullLoader`.\n\nIf an attacker can control or replace the YAML configuration file provided to the `--run_config` argument, they may inject a malicious payload that results in arbitrary code execution.",
