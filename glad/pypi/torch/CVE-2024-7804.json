  "PackageSlug": "pypi/torch",
  "Title": "Withdrawn Advisory: PyTorch deserialization vulnerability",
  "Description": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it describes known functionality of PyTorch. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA deserialization vulnerability exists in the Pytorch RPC framework (torch.distributed.rpc) in pytorch/pytorch versions \u003c=2.3.1. The vulnerability arises from the lack of security verification during the deserialization process of PythonUDF objects in pytorch/torch/distributed/rpc/internal.py. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely by sending a malicious serialized PythonUDF object, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the master node.",
