  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23531",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/guarddog",
  "Title": "Relative Path Traversal",
  "Description": "GuardDog is a CLI tool to identify malicious PyPI packages. Versions prior to 0.1.5 is vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal when scanning a specially-crafted local PyPI package. Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow an attacker to write an arbitrary file on the machine where GuardDog is executed due to a path traversal vulnerability when extracting the .tar.gz file of the package being scanned, which exists by design in the tarfile.TarFile.extractall function. This issue is patched in version 0.1.5.",
