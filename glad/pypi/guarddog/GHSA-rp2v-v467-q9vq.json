  "Title": "Relative Path Traversal",
  "Description": "Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow an attacker to write an arbitrary file on the machine where GuardDog is executed. This is due to a path traversal vulnerability when extracting the `.tar.gz` file of the package being scanned, which exists by design in the `tarfile.TarFile.extractall` function. ",
