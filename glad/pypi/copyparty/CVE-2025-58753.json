  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-58753",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/copyparty",
  "Title": "copyparty: Sharing a single file does not fully restrict access to other files in source folder",
  "Description": "There was a missing permission-check in the shares feature (the `shr` global-option).\n\nWhen a share is created for just one file inside a folder, it was possible to access the other files inside that folder by guessing the filenames.\n\nIt was not possible to descend into subdirectories in this manner; only the sibling files were accessible.\n\nThis issue did not affect filekeys or dirkeys.",
