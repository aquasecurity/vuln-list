  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47867",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/gradio",
  "Title": "Gradio lacks integrity checking on the downloaded FRP client",
  "Description": "This vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded FRP client, which could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious code. If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded, they could modify the binary without detection, as the Gradio server does not verify the file's checksum or signature.\n\n**Who is impacted?**\nAny users utilizing the Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client could be affected by this vulnerability, especially those relying on the executable binary for secure data tunneling.",
