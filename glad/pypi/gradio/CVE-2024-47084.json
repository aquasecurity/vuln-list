  "PackageSlug": "pypi/gradio",
  "Title": "Gradios's CORS origin validation is not performed when the request has a cookie",
  "Description": "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attackerâ€™s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication.",
