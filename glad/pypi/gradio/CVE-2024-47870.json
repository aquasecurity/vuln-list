  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47870",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/gradio",
  "Title": "Gradio has a race condition in update_root_in_config may redirect user traffic",
  "Description": "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors could exploit this race condition.",
