  "Description": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-48cq-79qq-6f7x. this link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA Cross-Site Request Forgery gives attackers the ability to upload many large files to a victim, if they are running Gradio locally. To resolve this a PR tightening the CORS rules around Gradio applications has been submitted. In particular, it checks to see if the host header is localhost (or one of its aliases) and if so, it requires the origin header (if present) to be localhost (or one of its aliases) as well.",
