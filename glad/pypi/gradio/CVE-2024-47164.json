  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47164",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/gradio",
  "Title": "Gradio's `is_in_or_equal` function may be bypassed",
  "Description": "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads.",
