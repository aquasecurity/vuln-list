  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47165",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/gradio",
  "Title": "Gradio's CORS origin validation accepts the null origin",
  "Description": "**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability relates to **CORS origin validation accepting a null origin**. When a Gradio server is deployed locally, the `localhost_aliases` variable includes \"null\" as a valid origin. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from sandboxed iframes or other sources with a null origin, potentially leading to data theft, such as user authentication tokens or uploaded files. This impacts users running Gradio locally, especially those using basic authentication.",
