  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-25823",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/gradio",
  "Title": "Update share links to use FRP instead of SSH tunneling",
  "Description": "This is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio versions older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides.",
