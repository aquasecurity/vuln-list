  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27516",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Jinja2",
  "Title": "Jinja2 vulnerable to sandbox breakout through attr filter selecting format method",
  "Description": "An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the `|attr` filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates.\n\nJinja's sandbox does catch calls to `str.format` and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the `|attr` filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the `|attr` filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup.",
