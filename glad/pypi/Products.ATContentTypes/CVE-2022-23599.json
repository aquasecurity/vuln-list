  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23599",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Products.ATContentTypes",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
  "Description": "`Products.ATContentTypes` are the core content types for Plone that are dependent on `Products.ATContentTypes` which is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the `image_view_fullscreen` page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings of `Products.ATContentTypes`. As a workaround, make sure the `image_view_fullscreen` page is not stored in the cache.",
