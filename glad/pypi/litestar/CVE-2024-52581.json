  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-52581",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/litestar",
  "Title": "Litestar allows unbounded resource consumption (DoS vulnerability) ",
  "Description": "Litestar offers multiple methods to return a parsed representation of the request body, as well as extractors that rely on those parsers to map request content to structured data types. Multiple of those parsers do not have size limits when reading the request body into memory, which allows an attacker to cause excessive memory consumption on the server by sending large requests.",
