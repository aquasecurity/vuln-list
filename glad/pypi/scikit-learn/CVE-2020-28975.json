  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-28975",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/scikit-learn",
  "Title": "Denial of Service",
  "Description": "The `svm_predict_values` in `svm.cpp` in Libsvm, as used in scikit-learn and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a crafted model SVM (introduced via pickle, json, or any other model permanence standard) with a large value in the `_n_support` array. Note, the scikit-learn vendor's position is that the behavior can only occur if the library's API is violated by an application that changes a private attribute.",
