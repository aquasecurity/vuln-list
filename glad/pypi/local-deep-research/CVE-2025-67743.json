  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-67743",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/local-deep-research",
  "Title": "Local Deep Research is Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Download Service",
  "Description": "The download service (`download_service.py`) makes HTTP requests using raw `requests.get()` without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (`safe_requests.py`). This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls.\n\n**CWE**: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)\n\n---",
