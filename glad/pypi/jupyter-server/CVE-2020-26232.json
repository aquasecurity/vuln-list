  "Title": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')",
  "Description": "Jupyter Server has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website. All jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.",
