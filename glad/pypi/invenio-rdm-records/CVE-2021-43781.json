  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-43781",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/invenio-rdm-records",
  "Title": "Permissions not properly checked in Invenio-Drafts-Resources",
  "Description": "Invenio-Drafts-Resources does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public.",
