  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-35681",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/channels",
  "Title": "Information Exposure",
  "Description": "Django Channels allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from a different request scope. The legacy `channels.http.AsgiHandler` class, used for handling HTTP type requests in an ASGI environment prior to Django, did not correctly separate request scopes in Channels In many cases this would result in a crash but, with correct timing, responses could be sent to the wrong client, resulting in potential leakage of session identifiers and other sensitive data. Note that this affects only the legacy Channels provided class, and not Django's similar `ASGIHandler`, available from Django.",
