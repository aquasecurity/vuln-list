  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-39159",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/binderhub",
  "Title": "Code Injection",
  "Description": "BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories. where providing BinderHub with maliciously crafted input could execute code in the BinderHub context, with the potential to egress credentials of the BinderHub deployment, including JupyterHub API tokens, kubernetes service accounts, and docker registry credentials. This may provide the ability to manipulate images and other user created pods in the deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on the underlying kubernetes configuration. If users are unable to update they may disable the git repo provider by specifying the `BinderHub.repo_providers` as a workaround.",
