  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41202",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Overflow/crash in `tf.range`",
  "Description": "While calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel, there is a conditional statement of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in overflows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.sparse.eye(num_rows=9223372036854775807, num_columns=None)\n```\n\nSimilarly, `tf.range` would result in crashes due to overflows if the start or end point are too large.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.range(start=-1e+38, limit=1)\n```",
