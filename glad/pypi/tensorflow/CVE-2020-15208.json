  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15208",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Data corruption in tensorflow-lite",
  "Description": "When determining the common dimension size of two tensors, TFLite uses a `DCHECK` which is no-op outside of debug compilation modes:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/types.h#L437-L442\n\nSince the function always returns the dimension of the first tensor, malicious attackers can craft cases where this is larger than that of the second tensor. In turn, this would result in reads/writes outside of bounds since the interpreter will wrongly assume that there is enough data in both tensors.",
