  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29603",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite implementation of `ArgMin`/`ArgMax` If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition in the `if` is never true, so code writes past the last valid element of `output_dims-\u003edata`.",
