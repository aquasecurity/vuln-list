  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23563",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Insecure temporary file in Tensorflow",
  "Description": "In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness).\n\nIn several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage.",
