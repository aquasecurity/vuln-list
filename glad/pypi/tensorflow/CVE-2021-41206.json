  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41206",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.Depending on the API, this can result in undefined behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail related crashes but in some scenarios writes and reads from heap populated arrays are also possible. We have discovered these issues internally via tooling while working on improving/testing GPU op determinism. As such, we don't have reproducers and there will be multiple fixes for these issues.",
