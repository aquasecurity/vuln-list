  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23589",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
  "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow can trigger a null pointer dereference. There are 2 places where this can occur, for the same malicious alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one would trigger the same dereference in the second place). First, during constant folding, the `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for the binary operation. If a node is missing, the correposning `mul_*child` would be null, and the dereference in the subsequent line would be incorrect. We have a similar issue during `IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
