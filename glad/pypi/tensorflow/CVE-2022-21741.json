  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-21741",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Division by zero in TFLite",
  "Description": "An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in [the implementation of depthwise convolutions](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L96).\n\nThe parameters of the convolution can be user controlled and are also used within a division operation to determine the size of the padding that needs to be added before applying the convolution. There is no check before this division that the divisor is stricly positive.",
