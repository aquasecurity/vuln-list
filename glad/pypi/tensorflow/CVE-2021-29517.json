  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29517",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Divide By Zero",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A malicious user could trigger a division by 0 in `Conv3D` implementation. The implementation does a modulo operation based on user controlled input. Thus, when `filter` has a 0 as the fifth element, this results in a division by Additionally, if the shape of the two tensors is not valid, an Eigen assertion can be triggered, resulting in a program crash.",
