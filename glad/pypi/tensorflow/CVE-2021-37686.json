  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37686",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition (Infinite Loop)",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The strided slice implementation in `TFLite` has a logic bug which can allow an attacker to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support for ellipsis in axis definition. An attacker can craft a model such that `ellipsis_end_idx` is smaller than `i` (e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop does not increase `i` and the `continue` statement causes execution to skip over the preincrement at the end of the outer loop.",
