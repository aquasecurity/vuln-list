  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29529",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Off-by-one Error",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation computes two integers (representing the upper bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation-\u003eupper[i]` might be smaller than `interpolation-\u003elower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation-\u003eupper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation-\u003elower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, in the interpolation code, this would result in heap buffer overflow.",
