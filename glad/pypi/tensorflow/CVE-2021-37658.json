  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37658",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Access of Uninitialized Pointer",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in all operations of type `tf.raw_ops.MatrixSetDiagV*`. The implementation has incomplete validation that the value of `k` is a valid tensor. We have check that this value is either a scalar or a vector, but there is no check for the number of elements. If this is an empty tensor, then code that accesses the first element of the tensor is wrong.",
