  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41213",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Deadlock in mutually recursive `tf.function` objects",
  "Description": "The [code behind `tf.function` API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/python/eager/def_function.py#L542) can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function()\ndef fun1(num):\nif num == 1:\nreturn\nprint(num)\nfun2(num-1)\n\n@tf.function()\ndef fun2(num):\nif num == 0:\nreturn\nprint(num)\nfun1(num-1)\n\nfun1(9)\n```\n\nThis occurs due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object.\n\nLoading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent scenario.",
