  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41213",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Improper Locking",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.This occurs due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object. Loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent scenario.",
