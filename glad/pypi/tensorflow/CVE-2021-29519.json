  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29519",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion)",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The API of `tf.raw_ops.SparseCross` allows combinations which would result in a `CHECK`-failure and denial of service. This is because the implementation is tricked to consider a tensor of type `tstring` which in fact contains integral elements. Fixing the type confusion by preventing mixing `DT_STRING` and `DT_INT64` types solves this issue.",
