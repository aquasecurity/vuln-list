  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When ops that have specified input sizes receive a differing number of inputs, the executor will crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit f5381e0e10b5a61344109c1b7c174c68110f7629. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
