  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23557",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Divide By Zero",
  "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in `BiasAndClamp` implementation. There is no check that the `bias_size` is non zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
