  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23566",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow is vulnerable to a heap OOB write in `Grappler`. The `set_output` function writes to an array at the specified index. Hence, this gives a malicious user a write primitive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
