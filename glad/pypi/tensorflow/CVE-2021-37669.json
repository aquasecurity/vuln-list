  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37669",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation uses a user controlled argument to resize a `std::vector`. However, as `std::vector::resize` takes the size argument as a `size_t` and `output_size` is an `int`, there is an implicit conversion to unsigned. If the attacker supplies a negative value, this conversion results in a crash. A similar issue occurs in `CombinedNonMaxSuppression`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 3a7362750d5c372420aa8f0caf7bf5b5c3d0f52d and commit [b5cdbf12ffcaaffecf98f22a6be5a64bb96e4f58. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
