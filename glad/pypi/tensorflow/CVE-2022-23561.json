  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23561",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array in TFLite. In fact, the attacker can override the linked list used by the memory allocator. This can be leveraged for an arbitrary write primitive under certain conditions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
