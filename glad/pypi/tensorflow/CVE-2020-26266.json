  "Description": "Under certain cases, a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to [default initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f70160322a579144950dff1537dcbe3c7c09d6f5/third_party/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/FixedPoint/FixedPointTypes.h#L61-L104):\n\n```cc\nstruct QUInt8 {\nQUInt8() {}\n// ...\nuint8_t value;\n};\n\nstruct QInt16 {\nQInt16() {}\n// ...\nint16_t value;\n};\n\nstruct QUInt16 {\nQUInt16() {}\n// ...\nuint16_t value;\n};\n\nstruct QInt32 {\nQInt32() {}\n// ...\nint32_t value;\n};\n```",
