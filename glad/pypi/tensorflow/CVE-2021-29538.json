  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29538",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Divide By Zero",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a division by zero to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This is because the implementation computes a divisor based on user provided data (i.e., the shape of the tensors given as arguments). If all shapes are empty then `work_unit_size` is Since there is no check for this case before division, this results in a runtime exception, with potential to be abused for a denial of service.",
