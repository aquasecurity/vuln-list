  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15205",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the `data_splits` argument of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` lacks validation. This allows a user to pass values that can cause heap overflow errors and even leak contents of memory In the linked code snippet, all the binary strings after `ee ff` are contents from the memory stack. Since these can contain return addresses, this data leak can be used to defeat ASLR.",
