  "Title": "Use of Uninitialized Resource",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`, an attacker can trigger denial of service via segmentation faults. The implementation fails to detect cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data from a null buffer.",
