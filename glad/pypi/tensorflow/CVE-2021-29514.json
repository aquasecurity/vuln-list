  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29514",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`, then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op. Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor.",
