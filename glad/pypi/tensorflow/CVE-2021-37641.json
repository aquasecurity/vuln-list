  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37641",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the arguments to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather` don't determine a valid ragged tensor c ode can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers. The implementation directly reads the first dimension of a tensor shape before checking that said tensor has rank of at least 1 (i.e., it is not a scalar). Furthermore, the implementation does not check that the list given by `params_nested_splits` is not an empty list of tensors.",
