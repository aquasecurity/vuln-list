  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23567",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
  "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementations of `Sparse*Cwise*` ops is vulnerable to integer overflows. These can be used to trigger large allocations (so, OOM based denial of service) or `CHECK`-fails when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, assert failures based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
