  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29576",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The implementation does not check that the initialization of `Pool3dParameters` completes successfully. Since the constructor uses `OP_REQUIRES` to validate conditions, the first assertion that fails interrupts the initialization of `params`, making it contain invalid data. In turn, this might cause a heap buffer overflow, depending on default initialized values.",
