  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29518",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In eager mode (default in TF), session operations are invalid. However, users could still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger a null pointer dereference. The implementation dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it is valid. Thus, in eager mode, `ctx-\u003esession_state()` is nullptr and the call of the member function is undefined behavior.",
