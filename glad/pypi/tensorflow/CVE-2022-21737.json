  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-21737",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Assertion failure based denial of service in Tensorflow",
  "Description": "The [implementation of `*Bincount` operations](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc) allows malicious users to cause denial of service by passing in arguments which would trigger a `CHECK`-fail:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.DenseBincount(\ninput=[[0], [1], [2]],\nsize=[1],\nweights=[3,2,1],\nbinary_output=False)\n```\n\nThere are several conditions that the input arguments must satisfy. Some are not caught during shape inference and others are not caught during kernel implementation. This results in `CHECK` failures later when the output tensors get allocated.",
