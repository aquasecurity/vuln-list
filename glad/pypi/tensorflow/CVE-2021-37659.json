  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37659",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in all binary `cwise` operations that don't require broadcasting (e.g., gradients of binary `cwise` operations). The implementation assumes that the two inputs have exactly the same number of elements but does not check that. Hence, when the `eigen` functor executes it triggers heap OOB reads and undefined behavior due to binding to nullptr.",
