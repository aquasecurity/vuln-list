  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26269",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "TensorFlow vulnerable to heap out of bounds read in filesystem glob matching",
  "Description": "The general implementation for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is vulnerable to an access out of bounds of [the array holding the directories](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/458c6260265c46ebaf18052d6c61aea4b6b40926/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc#L127):\n\n```cc\nif (!fs-\u003eMatch(child_path, dirs[dir_index])) { ... }\n```\n\nSince `dir_index` is [unconditionaly incremented](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/458c6260265c46ebaf18052d6c61aea4b6b40926/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc#L106) outside of the lambda function where the vulnerable pattern occurs, this results in an access out of bounds issue under certain scenarios. For example, if `/tmp/x` is a directory that only contains a single file `y`, then the following scenario will cause a crash due to the out of bounds read:\n\n```python\n\u003e\u003e\u003e tf.io.gfile.glob('/tmp/x/')\nSegmentation fault\n```\n\nThere are multiple invariants and preconditions that are assumed by the parallel implementation of `GetMatchingPaths` but are not verified by the PRs introducing it ([#40861](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/40861) and [#44310](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/44310)). Thus, we are completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate these.",
