  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37646",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The implementation calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer.",
