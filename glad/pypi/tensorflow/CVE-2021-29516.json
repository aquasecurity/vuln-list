  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29516",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "NULL Pointer Dereference",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Calling `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` with arguments specifying an invalid ragged tensor results in a null pointer dereference. The implementation of `RaggedTensorToVariant` operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/904b3926ed1c6c70380d5313d282d248a776baa1/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc#L39-L40) does not validate that the ragged tensor argument is non-empty. Since `batched_ragged` contains no elements, `batched_ragged.splits` is a null vector, thus `batched_ragged.splits(0)` will result in dereferencing `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
