  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-41898",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` is given empty inputs, TensorFlow will crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit af4a6a3c8b95022c351edae94560acc61253a1b8. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
