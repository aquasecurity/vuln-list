{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37685",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Read",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TFLite's `expand_dims.cc` contains a vulnerability which allows reading one element outside of bounds of heap allocated data. If `axis` is a large negative value (e.g., `-100000`), then after the first `if` it would still be negative. The check following the `if` statement will pass and the `for` loop would read one element before the start of `input_dims.data` (when `i = 0`).",
