{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15198",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
  "Description": "In Tensorflow, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one. The values in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers.",
