  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37671",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Access of Uninitialized Pointer",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.Map*` and `tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*` operations. The implementation has a check in place to ensure that `indices` is in ascending order, but does not check that `indices` is not empty. ",
