{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-37661",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tensorflow",
  "Title": "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types",
  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a denial of service in `boosted_trees_create_quantile_stream_resource` by using negative arguments. The implementation does not validate that `num_streams` only contains non-negative numbers. In turn, this results in using this value to allocate memory. However, `reserve` receives an unsigned integer so there is an implicit conversion from a negative value to a large positive unsigned. This results in a crash from the standard library.",
