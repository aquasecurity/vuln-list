  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-49767",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Werkzeug",
  "Title": "Werkzeug possible resource exhaustion when parsing file data in forms",
  "Description": "Applications using Werkzeug to parse `multipart/form-data` requests are vulnerable to resource exhaustion. A specially crafted form body can bypass the `Request.max_form_memory_size` setting.\n\n\nThe `Request.max_content_length` setting, as well as resource limits provided by deployment software and platforms, are also available to limit the resources used during a request. This vulnerability does not affect those settings. All three types of limits should be considered and set appropriately when deploying an application.",
