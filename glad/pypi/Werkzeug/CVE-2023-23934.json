  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-23934",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Werkzeug",
  "Title": "Incorrect parsing of nameless cookies leads to __Host- cookies bypass",
  "Description": "Browsers may allow \"nameless\" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain.\n\nWerkzeug \u003c= 2.2.2 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as `__Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.",
