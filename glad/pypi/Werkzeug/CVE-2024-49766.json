  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-49766",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Werkzeug",
  "Title": "Werkzeug safe_join not safe on Windows",
  "Description": "On Python \u003c 3.11 on Windows, `os.path.isabs()` does not catch UNC paths like `//server/share`. Werkzeug's `safe_join()` relies on this check, and so can produce a path that is not safe, potentially allowing unintended access to data. Applications using Python \u003e= 3.11, or not using Windows, are not vulnerable.",
