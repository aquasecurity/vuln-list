  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-67748",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/fickling",
  "Title": "Fickling has Code Injection vulnerability via pty.spawn()",
  "Description": "An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Fickling allows a crafted pickle file to bypass the \"unused variable\" heuristic, enabling arbitrary code execution. This bypass is achieved by adding a trivial operation to the pickle file that \"uses\" the otherwise unused variable left on the stack after a malicious operation, tricking the detection mechanism into classifying the file as safe.",
