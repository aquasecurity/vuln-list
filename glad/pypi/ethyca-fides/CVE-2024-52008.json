  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ethyca-fides",
  "Title": "Password Policy Bypass Vulnerability in Fides Webserver User Accept Invite API",
  "Description": "The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character.",
