  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ethyca-fides",
  "Title": "Fides' Admin UI User Password Change Does Not Invalidate Current Session",
  "Description": "Admin UI user password changes in Fides do not invalidate active user sessions, creating a vulnerability chaining opportunity where attackers who have obtained session tokens through other attack vectors (such as XSS) can maintain access even after password reset. This issue is not directly exploitable on its own and requires a prerequisite vulnerability to obtain valid session tokens in the first place.",
