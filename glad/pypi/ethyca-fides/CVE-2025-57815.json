  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ethyca-fides",
  "Title": "Fides has a Lack of Brute-Force Protections on Authentication Endpoints",
  "Description": "The Fides Admin UI login endpoint relies on a general IP-based rate limit for all API traffic and lacks specific anti-automation controls designed to protect against brute-force attacks. This could allow attackers to conduct credential testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords.",
