  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-57816",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ethyca-fides",
  "Title": "Fides Webserver API Rate Limiting Vulnerability in Proxied Environments",
  "Description": "The Fides Webserver API's built-in IP-based rate limiting is ineffective in environments with CDNs, proxies or load balancers. The system incorrectly applies rate limits based on directly connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs, and stores counters in-memory rather than in a shared store. This allows attackers to bypass intended rate limits and potentially cause denial of service.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in rate limiting for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API gateways, etc.) are not affected.",
