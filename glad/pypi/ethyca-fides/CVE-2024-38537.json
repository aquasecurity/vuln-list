  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-38537",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ethyca-fides",
  "Title": "Inclusion of Untrusted polyfill.io Code Vulnerability in fides.js",
  "Description": "`fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard.\n\nOn June 25th, 2024, Sansec published the following regarding the `polyfill.io` domain.\n\n\u003e The polyfill.js is a popular open source library to support older browsers. 100K+ sites embed it using the cdn.polyfill.io domain... However, in February this year, a Chinese company bought the domain and the Github account. Since then, this domain was caught injecting malware on mobile devices via any site that embeds cdn.polyfill.io.\n\nTherefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the compromised domain.\n\nNo exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified at this time, but other script developers who use `https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js` have reported redirects to malicious websites.",
