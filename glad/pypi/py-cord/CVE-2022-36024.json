  "Title": "Bots using py-cord as Discord API wrapper are vulnerable to shutdowns through remote code execution",
  "Description": "A fork of discord.py py-cord is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord written in Python. This issue allows users to be able to remotely shutdown the a bot running on py-cord, via adding it to a discord server with the `application.commands` scope but not the `bot` scope - then executing a command in that server. Currently, it appears that all public bots that use slash commands are affected. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.1. There are currently no recommended workarounds - please upgrade to a patched version.",
