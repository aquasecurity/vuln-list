  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-5227",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/feedgen",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs (XML Entity Expansion)",
  "Description": "Feedgen is susceptible to XML Denial of Service attacks. The library allows supplying XML as content for some available fields. This XML will be parsed and integrated into the existing XML tree. During this process, feedgen is vulnerable to XML Denial of Service Attacks (e.g. XML Bomb). This becomes a concern in particular if feedgen is used to include content from untrused sources and if XML (including XHTML) is directly included instead of providing plain text content only.",
