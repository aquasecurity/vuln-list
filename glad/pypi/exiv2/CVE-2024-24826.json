  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-24826",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/exiv2",
  "Title": "Exiv2 has an out-of-bounds read in QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder",
  "Description": "An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0 (see https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337), so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.",
