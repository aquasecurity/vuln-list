  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-61784",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/llamafactory",
  "Title": "LLaMA Factory's Chat API Contains Critical SSRF and LFI Vulnerabilities",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the chat API allows any authenticated user to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external networks. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services, reconnaissance of the internal network, or interaction with third-party services. The same mechanism also allows for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, enabling users to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.",
