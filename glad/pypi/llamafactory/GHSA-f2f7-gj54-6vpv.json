  "Title": "LLaMA-Factory Allows Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization in Ilamafy_baichuan2.py",
  "Description": "A critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script of the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) project. The script performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied `.bin` files from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a malicious `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization.",
