  "Title": "Potential log injection in reset user endpoint in CKAN",

This could lead to an attacker injecting false log entries or corrupt the log file format.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in the CKAN 2.9.11 and 2.10.4 versions\n\n### Workarounds\nOverride the `/user/reset` endpoint to filter the `id` parameter in order to exclude newlines\n\n",
