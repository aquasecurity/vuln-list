  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-43371",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/ckan",
  "Title": "Potential access to sensitive URLs via CKAN extensions (SSRF)",
  "Description": "There are a number of CKAN plugins, including [XLoader](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-xloader), [DataPusher](https://github.com/ckan/datapusher), [Resource proxy](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/data-viewer.html#resource-proxy) and [ckanext-archiver](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-archiver/), that work by downloading the contents of local or remote files in order to perform some actions with their contents (e.g. pushing to the DataStore, streaming contents or saving a local copy). All of them use the resource URL, and there are currently no checks to limit what URLs can be requested. This means that a malicious (or unaware) user can create a resource with a URL pointing to a place where they should not have access in order for one of the previous tools to retrieve it (known as a [Server Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)).",
