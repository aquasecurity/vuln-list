  "Title": "opentelemetry-instrumentation Denial of Service vulnerability due to unbound cardinality metrics",
  "Description": "### Summary\nAutoinstrumentation out of the box adds the label `http_method` that has unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent.\n\n### Details\nHTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long.\n\n### PoC\nSend many requests with long randomly generated HTTP methods and observe how memory consumption increases during it.",
