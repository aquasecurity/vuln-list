  "Description": "There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico.\nExploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content.\n\nConsidering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content.",
