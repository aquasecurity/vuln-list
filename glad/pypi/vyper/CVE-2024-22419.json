  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-22419",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vyper",
  "Title": "concat built-in can corrupt memory in vyper",
  "Description": "`concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `\u003e=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function).\n\nA contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.\n\nTracked in issue https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3737",
