  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-24563",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vyper",
  "Title": "Vyper negative array index bounds checks",
  "Description": "Arrays can be keyed by a signed integer, while they are defined for unsigned integers only. The typechecker doesn't throw when spotting the usage of an `int` as an index for an array. Typically, negative integers are filtered out at runtime by the bounds checker, but small enough (i.e. large in magnitude, ex. `-2**255 + 5`) quantities combined with large enough arrays (at least `2**255` in length) can pass the bounds checker, resulting in unexpected behavior.\n\nA contract search was performed, and no production contracts were found to be impacted.",
