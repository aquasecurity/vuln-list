  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-26149",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vyper",
  "Title": "Vyper's `_abi_decode` vulnerable to Memory Overflow",
  "Description": "If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading to bugs in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. The advisory has been assigned low severity, because it is only observable if there is a memory write between two invocations of `abi_decode` on the same input.",
