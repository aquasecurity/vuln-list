  "Title": "Vyper's bounds check on built-in `slice()` function can be overflowed",
  "Description": "[The bounds check for slices](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/b01cd686aa567b32498fefd76bd96b0597c6f099/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L404-L457) does not account for the ability for `start + length` to overflow when the values aren't literals.\n\nIf a `slice()` function uses a non-literal argument for the `start`  or `length` variable, this creates the ability for an attacker to overflow the bounds check.\n\nThis issue can be used to do OOB access to storage, memory or calldata addresses. It can also be used to corrupt the `length` slot of the respective array.\n\nA contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.\n\ntracking in issue https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3756.\npatched in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3818.",
