  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-24567",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/vyper",
  "Title": "Vyper's raw_call `value=` kwargs not disabled for static and delegate calls",
  "Description": "Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin `raw_call` even if the call is a `delegatecall` or a `staticcall`. But in the context of `delegatecall` and `staticcall` the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes, and vyper will silently ignore the `value=` argument.\n\nA contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.",
