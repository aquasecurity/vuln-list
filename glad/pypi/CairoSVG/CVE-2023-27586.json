  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-27586",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/CairoSVG",
  "Title": "CairoSVG improperly processes SVG files loaded from external resources",
  "Description": "When CairoSVG processes an SVG file, it can make requests to the inner host and different outside hosts.\n\nWhen CairoSVG processes an SVG file, it can send requests to external hosts and wait for a response from the external server after a successful TCP handshake. This will cause the server to hang.\nIt seems this bug can affect websites or servers and cause a complete freeze while uploading this PoC file to the server.\n\n\nSpecially crafted SVG file that opens /proc/self/fd/1 or /dev/stdin results in a hang with a tiny PoC file. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted SVG file.\nIt seems this bug can affect websites or servers and cause a complete freeze while uploading this PoC file to the server.",
