  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-22817",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Pillow",
  "Title": "Arbitrary expression injection in Pillow",
  "Description": "`PIL.ImageMath.eval` in Pillow before 9.0.0 allows evaluation of arbitrary expressions, such as ones that use the Python exec method `ImageMath.eval(\"exec(exit())\")`.\n\nWhile Pillow 9.0.0 restricted top-level builtins available to PIL.ImageMath.eval(), it did not prevent builtins available to lambda expressions. These are now also restricted in 9.0.1.",
