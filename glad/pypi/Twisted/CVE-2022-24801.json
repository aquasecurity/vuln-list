  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-24801",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Twisted",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')",
  "Description": "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0, the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affected use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser, so it is not affected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Two workarounds are available: Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxies have been addressed, such as by upgrading them; or filter malformed requests by other means, such as configuration of an upstream proxy.",
