  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-24801",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Twisted",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests in twisted.web",
  "Description": "The Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230:\n\n1. The Content-Length header value could have a `+` or `-` prefix.\n2. Illegal characters were permitted in chunked extensions, such as the LF (`\\n`) character.\n3. Chunk lengths, which are expressed in hexadecimal format, could have a prefix of `0x`.\n4. HTTP headers were stripped of all leading and trailing ASCII whitespace, rather than only space and HTAB (`\\t`).\n\nThis non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling.",
