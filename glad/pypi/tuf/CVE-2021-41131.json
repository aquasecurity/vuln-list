  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41131",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/tuf",
  "Title": "Client metadata path-traversal",
  "Description": "In both clients (`tuf/client` and `tuf/ngclient`), there is a path traversal vulnerability that in the worst case can overwrite files ending in `.json` anywhere on the client system on a call to `get_one_valid_targetinfo()`. It occurs because the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal characters (ie `../../name.json`).\n\nThe impact is mitigated by a few facts:\n* It only affects implementations that allow arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata\n* The attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing role and B) get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata\n* The written file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid, signed targets file. The file extension is always .json.",
