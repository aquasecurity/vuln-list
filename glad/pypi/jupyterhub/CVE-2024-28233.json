  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28233",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyterhub",
  "Title": "Cross site scripting (XSS) in JupyterHub via Self-XSS leveraged by Cookie Tossing",
  "Description": "Affected configurations:\n\n- Single-origin JupyterHub deployments\n- JupyterHub deployments with user-controlled applications running on subdomains or peer subdomains of either the Hub or a single-user server.\n\nBy tricking a user into visiting a malicious subdomain, the attacker can achieve an XSS directly affecting the former's session. More precisely, in the context of JupyterHub, this XSS could achieve the following:\n\n- Full access to JupyterHub API and user's single-user server, e.g.\n- Create and exfiltrate an API Token\n- Exfiltrate all files hosted on the user's single-user server: notebooks, images, etc.\n- Install malicious extensions. They can be used as a backdoor to silently regain access to victim's session anytime.",
