  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-42439",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/GeoNode",
  "Title": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
  "Description": "GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a allow list, but the allow list can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a allow listed address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. Version 4.1.3.post1 is the first available version that contains a patch.",
