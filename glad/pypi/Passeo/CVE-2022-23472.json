  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-23472",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Passeo",
  "Title": "Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
  "Description": "Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to 1.0.5 rely on the python `random` library for random value selection. The python `random` library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
