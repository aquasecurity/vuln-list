  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-30798",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/starlette",
  "Title": "MultipartParser denial of service with too many fields or files",
  "Description": "The `MultipartParser` using the package `python-multipart` accepts an unlimited number of multipart parts (form fields or files).\n\nProcessing too many parts results in high CPU usage and high memory usage, eventually leading to an \u003cabbr title=\"out of memory\"\u003eOOM\u003c/abbr\u003e process kill.\n\nThis can be triggered by sending too many small form fields with no content, or too many empty files.\n\nFor this to take effect application code has to:\n\n* Have `python-multipart` installed and\n* call `request.form()`\n* or via another framework like FastAPI, using form field parameters or `UploadFile` parameters, which in turn calls `request.form()`.",
