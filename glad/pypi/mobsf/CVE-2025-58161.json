  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-58161",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/mobsf",
  "Title": "MobSF Path Traversal in GET /download/\u003cfilename\u003e using absolute filenames",
  "Description": "The GET /download/\u003cfilename\u003e route uses string path verification via os.path.commonprefix, which allows an authenticated user to download files outside the DWD_DIR download directory from \"neighboring\" directories whose absolute paths begin with the same prefix as DWD_DIR (e.g., .../downloads_bak, .../downloads.old). This is a Directory Traversal (escape) leading to a data leak.",
