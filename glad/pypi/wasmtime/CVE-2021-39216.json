  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-39216",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/wasmtime",
  "Title": "Use after free passing `externref`s to Wasm in Wasmtime",
  "Description": "There was a use-after-free bug when passing `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm content.\n\nTo trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same time, either by\n\n* passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm function,\n* or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value return function defined in the host.\n\nIf you do not have host code that matches one of these shapes, then you are not impacted.",
