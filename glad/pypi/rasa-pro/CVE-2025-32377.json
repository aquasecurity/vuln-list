  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-32377",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/rasa-pro",
  "Title": "Rasa Pro Missing Authentication For Voice Connector APIs",
  "Description": "## Vulnerability\nA vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro where voice connectors in Rasa Pro do not properly implement authentication even when a token is configured in the `credentials.yml` file. This could allow an attacker to submit voice data to the Rasa Pro assistant from an unauthenticated source.\n\nThis impacts the following connectors:\n\n- `audiocodes_stream`\n- `genesys`\n- `jambonz`\n\nAs part of our investigation to resolve this issue, we have also performed a security review of our other voice channel connectors:\n\n- `browser_audio`: Does not support authentication. This is a development channel not intended for production use.\n- `twilio_media_streams`, `twilio_voice` and `jambonz`: Authentication is currently not supported by these channels, but our investigation has found a way for us to enable it for these voice channel connectors in a future Rasa Pro release.\n\n## Fix\nThe issue has been resolved for `audiocodes`, `audiocodes_stream`, and `genesys` connectors. Fixed versions of Rasa Pro have been released for `3.9.20`, `3.10.19`, `3.11.7` and `3.12.6`. Please update to a fixed release.\n\nIf you are using one of the affected connectors, we strongly recommend upgrading to a fixed version. For connectors where authentication is not supported (e.g., Twilio), we suggest taking extra caution and considering other compensating controls if applicable.",
