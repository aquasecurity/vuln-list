  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-13948",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/apache-superset",
  "Title": "OS Command Injection",
  "Description": "While investigating a bug report on Apache Superset, it was determined that an authenticated user could craft requests via a number of templated text fields in the product that would allow arbitrary access to Pythonâ€™s `os` package in the web application process in versions. It was thus possible for an authenticated user to list and access files, environment variables, and process information. In addition, it was possible to set environment variables for the current process, create and update files in folders writable by the web process, and execute arbitrary programs accessible by the web process. All other operations available to the `os` package in Python were also available, even if not explicitly enumerated in this CVE.",
