  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-30370",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/jupyterlab-git",
  "Title": "jupyterlab-git has a command injection vulnerability in \"Open Git Repository in Terminal\"",
  "Description": "## Overview\n\nOn many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution [^1] string in the syntax `$(\u003ccommand\u003e)`. These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux distributions [^2]. If a user starts `jupyter-lab` in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks \"Git \u003e Open Git Repository in Terminal\" from the menu bar, then the injected command `\u003ccommand\u003e` is run in the user's shell without the user's permission.\n\nThis issue is occurring because when that menu entry is clicked, `jupyterlab-git` opens the terminal and runs `cd \u003cgit-repo-path\u003e` through the shell to set the current directory [^3]. Doing so runs any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete fix [^4].",
