  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-6446",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/numpy",
  "Title": "Arbitrary Code Execution",
  "Description": "An unsafe use of the pickle Python module allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a `numpy.load` call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example) loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated sources.",
