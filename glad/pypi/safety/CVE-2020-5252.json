  "PackageSlug": "pypi/safety",
  "Title": "Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision",
  "Description": "The safety package for Python has a potential security issue. There are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to `poison-pill` command-line Safety package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious or non-secure packages. This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because the attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety tool itself.",
