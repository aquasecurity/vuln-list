  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54433",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/bugsink",
  "Title": "Bugsink path traversal via event_id in ingestion",
  "Description": "In affected versions, ingestion paths construct file locations directly from untrusted `event_id` input without validation. A specially crafted `event_id` can result in paths outside the intended directory, potentially allowing file overwrite or creation in arbitrary locations.\n\nSubmitting such input requires access to a valid DSN. While that limits exposure, DSNs are sometimes discoverable—for example, when included in frontend code—and should not be treated as a strong security boundary.",
