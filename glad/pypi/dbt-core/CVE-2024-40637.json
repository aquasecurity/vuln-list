  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-40637",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/dbt-core",
  "Title": "dbt has an implicit override for built-in materializations from installed packages",
  "Description": "_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nWhen a user installs a [package](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages) in dbt, it has the ability to override macros, materializations, and other core components of dbt. This is by design, as it allows packages to extend and customize dbt's functionality. However, this also means that a malicious package could potentially override these components with harmful code.",
