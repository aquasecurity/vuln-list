  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-16984",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Information Exposure",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django in which unprivileged users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the `view` permission, resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.",
