  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-2512",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Malicious redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs containing basic auth",
  "Description": "Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. `django.contrib.auth.views.login()` and i18n) to redirect the user to an \"on success\" URL. The security check for these redirects (namely `django.utils.http.is_safe_url()`) considered some URLs with basic authentication credentials \"safe\" when they shouldn't be. For example, a URL like `http://mysite.example.com\\@attacker.com` would be considered safe if the request's host is `http://mysite.example.com`, but redirecting to this URL sends the user to `attacker.com`. Also, if a developer relies on `is_safe_url()` to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.",
