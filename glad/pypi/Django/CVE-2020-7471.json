  "Title": "SQL Injection",
  "Description": "Django allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter to a `contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg` instance, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.",
