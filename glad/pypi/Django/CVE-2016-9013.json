  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-9013",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle",
  "Description": "When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database settings TEST dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow an attacker with network access to the database server to connect. This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using the `manage.py test --keepdb` option or if the user has an active session (such as an attacker's connection).",
