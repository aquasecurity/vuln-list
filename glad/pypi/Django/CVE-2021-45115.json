  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-45115",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Denial-of-service in Django",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and 4.0 before 4.0.1. `UserAttributeSimilarityValidator` incurred significant overhead in evaluating a submitted password that was artificially large in relation to the comparison values. In a situation where access to user registration was unrestricted, this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack.",
