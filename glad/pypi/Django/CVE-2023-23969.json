  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-23969",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django contains Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via cached header",
  "Description": "In Django 3.2 before 3.2.17, 4.0 before 4.0.9, and 4.1 before 4.1.6, the parsed values of Accept-Language headers are cached in order to avoid repetitive parsing. This leads to a potential denial-of-service vector via excessive memory usage if the raw value of Accept-Language headers is very large.",
