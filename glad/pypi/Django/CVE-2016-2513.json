  "Identifier": "CVE-2016-2513",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "User enumeration through timing difference on password hasher work factor upgrade",
  "Description": "In each major version of Django since, the default number of iterations for the PBKDF2PasswordHasher and its subclasses has increased. This improves the security of the password as the speed of hardware increases, however, it also creates a timing difference between a login request for a user with a password encoded in an older number of iterations and login request for a nonexistent user (which runs the default hasher's default number of iterations since Django ). This only affects users who haven't logged in since the iterations were increased. The first time a user logs in after an iterations increase, their password is updated with the new iterations and there is no longer a timing difference.",
