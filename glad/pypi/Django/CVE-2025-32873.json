  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-32873",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django has a denial-of-service possibility in strip_tags()",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 4.2 before 4.2.21, 5.1 before 5.1.9, and 5.2 before 5.2.1. The django.utils.html.strip_tags() function is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (slow performance) when processing inputs containing large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. The template filter striptags is also vulnerable, because it is built on top of strip_tags().",
