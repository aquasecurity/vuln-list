{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-12794",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django vulnerable to XSS on 500 pages",
  "Description": "In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with `DEBUG = True` (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings.",
