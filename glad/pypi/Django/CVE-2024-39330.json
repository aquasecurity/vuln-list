{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-39330",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django Path Traversal vulnerability",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. Derived classes of the `django.core.files.storage.Storage` base class, when they override `generate_filename()` without replicating the file-path validations from the parent class, potentially allow directory traversal via certain inputs during a `save()` call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)",
