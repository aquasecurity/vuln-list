{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-7537",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Incorrect Regular Expression",
  "Description": "If `django.utils.text.Truncator`'s `chars()` and `words()` methods were passed the `html=True` argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The `chars()` and words()` methods are used to implement the `truncatechars_html` and `truncatewords_html` template filters, which were thus vulnerable.",
