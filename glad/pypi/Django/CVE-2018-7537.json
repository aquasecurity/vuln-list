  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-7537",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django Denial-of-service possibility in truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before 1.8.19. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.",
