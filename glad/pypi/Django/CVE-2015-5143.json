{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-5143",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "DOS by filling session store",
  "Description": "The session backends created a new empty record in the session storage anytime request.session was accessed and there was a session key provided in the request cookies that didn't already have a session record. This could allow an attacker to easily create many new session records simply by sending repeated requests with unknown session keys, potentially filling up the session store or causing other users' session records to be evicted.",
