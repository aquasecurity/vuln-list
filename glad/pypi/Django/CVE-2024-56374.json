  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-56374",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django has a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in IPv6 validation",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 5.1 before 5.1.5, 5.0 before 5.0.11, and 4.2 before 4.2.18. Lack of upper-bound limit enforcement in strings passed when performing IPv6 validation could lead to a potential denial-of-service attack. The undocumented and private functions `clean_ipv6_address` and `is_valid_ipv6_address` are vulnerable, as is the `django.forms.GenericIPAddressField` form field. (The django.db.models.GenericIPAddressField model field is not affected.)",
