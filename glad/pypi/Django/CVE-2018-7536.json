  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-7536",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django denial-of-service possibility in urlize and urlizetrunc template filters",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before 1.8.19. The `django.utils.html.urlize()` function was extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to catastrophic backtracking vulnerabilities in two regular expressions (only one regular expression for Django 1.8.x). The `urlize()` function is used to implement the urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, which were thus vulnerable.",
