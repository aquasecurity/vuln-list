{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-19844",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Django Potential account hijack via password reset form",
  "Description": "Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.)",
