  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-19118",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Django",
  "Title": "Incorrect Default Permissions",
  "Description": "Django allows unintended model editing. A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model, would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only parent model was not possible, but the parent model's `save()` method was called, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save signal handlers to be invoked.",
