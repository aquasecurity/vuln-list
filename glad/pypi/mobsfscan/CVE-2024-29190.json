  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-29190",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/mobsfscan",
  "Title": "SSRF Vulnerability on assetlinks_check(act_name, well_knowns)",
  "Description": "While examining the \"App Link assetlinks.json file could not be found\" vulnerability detected by MobSF, we, as the Trendyol Application Security team, noticed that a GET request was sent to the \"/.well-known/assetlinks.json\" endpoint for all hosts written with \"android:host\". In the AndroidManifest.xml file.\n\nSince MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in \"android:host\", requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This may cause SSRF vulnerability.",
