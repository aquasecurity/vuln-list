  "Title": "ReDoS in LDAP schema parser",
  "Description": "https://github.com/python-ldap/python-ldap/issues/424\n\n### Impact\nThe LDAP schema parser of python-ldap are vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service attack. The issue affects clients that use ``ldap.schema`` package to parse LDAP schema definitions from an untrusted source.\n\n### Patches\nThe upcoming release of python-ldap will contain a workaround to prevent ReDoS attacks. The schema parser refuses schema definitions with an excessive amount of backslashes.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs a workaround, users can check input for excessive amount of backslashes in schemas. More than a dozen backslashes per line are atypical.\n\n### References\n[CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [python-ldap](https://github.com/python-ldap/python-ldap) tracker\n",
