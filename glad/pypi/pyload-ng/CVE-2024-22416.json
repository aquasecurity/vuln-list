  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-22416",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pyload-ng",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery on any API call in pyLoad may lead to admin privilege escalation",
  "Description": "The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. This proof of concept shows how an unauthenticated user could trick the administrator's browser into creating a new admin user.",
