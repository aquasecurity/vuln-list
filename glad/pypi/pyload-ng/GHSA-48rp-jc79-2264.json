  "Title": "pyLoad CNL Blueprint allows Path Traversal through `dlc_path` which leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
  "Description": "**Path Traversal in pyLoad-ng CNL Blueprint via `package` parameter allows Arbitrary File Write leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)** The `addcrypted` endpoint in `pyload-ng` suffers from an unsafe path construction vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary files outside the designated storage directory. This can be abused to overwrite critical system files, including cron jobs and systemd services, leading to privilege escalation and remote code execution as root.",
