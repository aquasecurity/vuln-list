  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-60787",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/motioneye",
  "Title": "motionEye vulnerable to RCE via unsanitized motion config parameter",
  "Description": "A command injection vulnerability in MotionEye allows attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by supplying malicious values in configuration fields exposed via the Web UI. Because MotionEye writes user-supplied values directly into Motion configuration files without sanitization, attackers can inject shell syntax that is executed when the Motion process restarts. This issue enables full takeover of the MotionEye container and potentially the host environment (depending on container privileges).",
