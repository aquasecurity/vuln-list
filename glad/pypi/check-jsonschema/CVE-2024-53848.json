  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-53848",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/check-jsonschema",
  "Title": "check-jsonschema default caching for remote schemas allows for cache confusion",
  "Description": "The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache, e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`, they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema.\n\nSuch a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected.",
