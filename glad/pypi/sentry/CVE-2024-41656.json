  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-41656",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/sentry",
  "Title": "Sentry vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Description": "An unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform integration allows the storage of arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side. This payload could subsequently be rendered on the Issues page, creating a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability might lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of a userâ€™s browser.\n\nSelf-hosted Sentry users may be impacted if untrustworthy Integration platform integrations send external issues to their Sentry instance.",
