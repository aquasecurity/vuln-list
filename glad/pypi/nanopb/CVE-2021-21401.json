  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21401",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/nanopb",
  "Title": "nanopb vulnerable to invalid free() call with oneofs and PB_ENABLE_MALLOC",
  "Description": "Decoding a specifically formed message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed.",
