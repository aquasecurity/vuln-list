{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-13757",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/rsa",
  "Title": "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "Description": "Python-RSA ignores leading `\\0` bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).",
