  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-13757",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/rsa",
  "Title": "Python-RSA decryption of ciphertext leads to DoS",
  "Description": "Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).",

  "Pubdate": "2021-03-24",
  "AffectedRange": "\u003c4.1",
  "FixedVersions": [
    "4.1"
  ],
  "AffectedVersions": "All versions before 4.1",
  "NotImpacted": "All versions starting from 4.1",
