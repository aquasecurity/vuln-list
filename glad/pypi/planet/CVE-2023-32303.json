  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-32303",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/planet",
  "Title": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource",
  "Description": "Planet is software that provides satellite data. The secret file stores the user's Planet API authentication information. It should only be accessible by the user, but before version 2.0.1, its permissions allowed the user's group and non-group to read the file as well. This issue was patched in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, set the secret file permissions to only user read/write by hand.\n",
