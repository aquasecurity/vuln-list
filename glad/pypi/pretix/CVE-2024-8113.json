  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-8113",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/pretix",
  "Title": "pretix Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability",
  "Description": "Stored XSS in organizer and event settings of pretix up to 2024.7.0 allows malicious event organizers to inject HTML tags into e-mail previews on settings page. The default Content Security Policy of pretix prevents execution of attacker-provided scripts, making exploitation unlikely. However, combined with a CSP bypass (which is not currently known) the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other organizers or staff users.",
