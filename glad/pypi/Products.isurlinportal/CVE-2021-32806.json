  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-32806",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/Products.isurlinportal",
  "Title": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Products.isurlinportal",
  "Description": "Various parts of Plone use the 'is url in portal' check for security, mostly to see if it is safe to redirect to a url. A url like `https://example.org` is not in the portal.\nBut the url `https:example.org` without slashes tricks our code and it _is_ considered to be in the portal.\nWhen redirecting, some browsers go to `https://example.org`, others give an error.\nAttackers may use this to redirect you to their site, especially as part of a phishing attack.",
