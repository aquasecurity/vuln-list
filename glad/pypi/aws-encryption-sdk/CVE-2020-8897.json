  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-8897",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/aws-encryption-sdk",
  "Title": "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
  "Description": "A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS Encryption SDKs for Java, Python, C and Javalcript Due to the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used by the SDKs to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a multi-recipient setting. We recommend users update their SDK to or later.",
