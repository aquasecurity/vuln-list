  "Description": "A remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in how the auth chain cover index is calculated. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nServers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are not affected.",
