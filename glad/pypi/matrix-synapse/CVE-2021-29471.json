  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python. Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse `Push rules` can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue is patched A potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.",
