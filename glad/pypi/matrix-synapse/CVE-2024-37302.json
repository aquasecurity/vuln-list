  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-37302",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-synapse",
  "Title": "Synapse denial of service through media disk space consumption",
  "Description": "Synapse versions before 1.106 are vulnerable to a disk fill attack, where an unauthenticated adversary can induce Synapse to download and cache large amounts of remote media. The default rate limit strategy is insufficient to mitigate this. This can lead to a denial of service, ranging from further media uploads/downloads failing to completely unavailability of the Synapse process, depending on how Synapse was deployed.",
