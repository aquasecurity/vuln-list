  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26257",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-synapse",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Synapse is a reference homeserver implementation of Matrix. A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers.",
