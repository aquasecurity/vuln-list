  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-45129",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-synapse",
  "Title": "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling",
  "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server ACL event can impact performance temporarily or permanently leading to a persistent denial of service. Homeservers running on a closed federation (which presumably do not need to use server ACLs) are not affected. Server administrators are advised to upgrade to Synapse 1.94.0 or later. As a workaround, rooms with malicious server ACL events can be purged and blocked using the admin API.",
