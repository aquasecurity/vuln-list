{
  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-53863",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-synapse",
  "Title": "Synapse can be forced to thumbnail unexpected file formats, invoking external, potentially untrustworthy decoders",
  "Description": "In Synapse versions before 1.120.1, enabling the `dynamic_thumbnails` option or processing a specially crafted request could trigger the decoding and thumbnail generation of uncommon image formats, potentially invoking external tools like Ghostscript for processing.\n\nThis significantly expands the attack surface in a historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs the benefit, particularly since these formats are rarely used on the open web or within the Matrix ecosystem.\n\nFor a list of image formats, as well as decoding libraries and helper programs used, see [the Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html).",
