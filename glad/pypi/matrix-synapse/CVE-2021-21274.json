  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-21274",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-synapse",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their `.well-known` file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the `.well-known` file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. As a workaround, the `federation_domain_allow list` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.",
