Synapse is missing input validation of some parameters on the endpoints used to confirm third-party identifiers. This could cause excessive use of disk space and memory leading to resource exhaustion. Note that the groups feature is not part of the Matrix specification and the chosen maximum lengths are arbitrary. Not all clients might abide by them.",
