  "PackageSlug": "pypi/matrix-synapse",
  "Title": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
  "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver Prior to versions 1.95.1 and 1.96.0rc1, cached device information of remote users can be queried from Synapse. This can be used to enumerate the remote users known to a homeserver. System administrators are encouraged to upgrade to Synapse 1.95.1 or 1.96.0rc1 to receive a patch. As a workaround, the `federation_domain_allow list` can be used to limit federation traffic with a homeserver.\n",
