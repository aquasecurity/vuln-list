  "Title": "Scrapy allows redirect following in protocols other than HTTP",
  "Description": "Scrapy was following redirects regardless of the URL protocol, so redirects were working for `data://`, `file://`, `ftp://`, `s3://`, and any other scheme defined in the `DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS` setting.\n\nHowever, HTTP redirects should only work between URLs that use the `http://` or `https://` schemes.\n\nA malicious actor, given write access to the start requests (e.g. ability to define `start_urls`) of a spider and read access to the spider output, could exploit this vulnerability to:\n- Redirect to any local file using the `file://` scheme to read its contents.\n- Redirect to an `ftp://` URL of a malicious FTP server to obtain the FTP username and password configured in the spider or project.\n- Redirect to any `s3://` URL to read its content using the S3 credentials configured in the spider or project.\n\nFor `file://` and `s3://`, how the spider implements its parsing of input data into an output item determines what data would be vulnerable. A spider that always outputs the entire contents of a response would be completely vulnerable, while a spider that extracted only fragments from the response could significantly limit vulnerable data.",
