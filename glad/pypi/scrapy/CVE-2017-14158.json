  "PackageSlug": "pypi/scrapy",
  "Title": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
  "Description": "Scrapy allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into memory, which is especially problematic if the files are then individually written in a separate thread to a slow storage resource, as demonstrated by interaction between `dataReceived` (in `core/downloader/handlers/http11.py`) and S3FilesStore.",
