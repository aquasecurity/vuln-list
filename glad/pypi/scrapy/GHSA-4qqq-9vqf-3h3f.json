  "Title": "Scrapy leaks the authorization header on same-domain but cross-origin redirects",
  "Description": "Since version 2.11.1, Scrapy drops the `Authorization` header when a request is redirected to a different domain. However, it keeps the header if the domain remains the same but the scheme (http/https) or the port change, all scenarios where the header should also be dropped.\n\nIn the context of a man-in-the-middle attack, this could be used to get access to the value of that `Authorization` header",
