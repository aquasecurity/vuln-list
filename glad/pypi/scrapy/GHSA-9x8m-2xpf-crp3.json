  "Title": "Scrapy before v2.6.2 and v1.8.3 vulnerable to one proxy sending credentials to another",
  "Description": "Because of request retries and redirects, the same request can be processed by downloader middlewares more than once, including both the built-in HTTP proxy downloader middleware and any third-party proxy-rotation downloader middleware. These third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares could change the `proxy` metadata of a request to a new value, but fail to remove the `Proxy-Authentication` header from the previous value of the `proxy` metadata, causing the credentials of one proxy to be leaked to a different proxy.",
