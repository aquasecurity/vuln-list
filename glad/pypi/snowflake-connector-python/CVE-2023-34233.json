  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-34233",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/snowflake-connector-python",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')",
  "Description": "The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. Versions prior to 3.0.2 is vulnerable to command injection via single sign-on(SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL allow listing as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch for this issue.",
