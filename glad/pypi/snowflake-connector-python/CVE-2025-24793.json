  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-24793",
  "PackageSlug": "pypi/snowflake-connector-python",
  "Title": "snowflake-connector-python vulnerable to SQL Injection in write_pandas",
  "Description": "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake Connector for Python. A function from the snowflake.connector.pandas_tools module is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 2.2.5 through 3.13.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.13.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nA function from the snowflake.connector.pandas_tools module is not sanitizing all of its arguments, and queries using them are not parametrized. An attacker controlling these arguments could achieve SQL injection by passing crafted input. Any SQL executed that way by an attacker would still run in the context of the current session.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.13.1 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.13.1.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.
