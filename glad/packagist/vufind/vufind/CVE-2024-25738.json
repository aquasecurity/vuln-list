  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-25738",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/vufind/vufind",
  "Title": "VuFind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability",
  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /Upgrade/FixConfig route in Open Library Foundation VuFind 2.0 through 9.1 before 9.1.1 allows a remote attacker to overwrite local configuration files to gain access to the administrator panel and achieve Remote Code Execution. A mitigating factor is that it requires the allow_url_include PHP runtime setting to be on, which is off in default installations. It also requires the /Upgrade route to be exposed, which is exposed by default after installing VuFind, and is recommended to be disabled by setting autoConfigure to false in config.ini.",
