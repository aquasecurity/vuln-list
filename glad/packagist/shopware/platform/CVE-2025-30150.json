  "Title": "Shopware 6 allows attackers to check for registered accounts through the store-api",
  "Description": "Through the store-api it is possible as a attacker to check if a specific e-mail address has an account in the shop.\n\nUsing the store-api endpoint `/store-api/account/recovery-password` you get the response\n```\n{\"errors\":[{\"status\":\"404\",\"code\":\"CHECKOUT__CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND\",\"title\":\"Not Found\",\"detail\":\"No matching customer for the email \\u0022asdasfd@asdads.de\\u0022 was found.\",\"meta\":{\"parameters\":{\"email\":\"asdasfd@asdads.de\"}}}]}\n```\n\nwhich indicates clearly that there is no account for this customer. In contrast you get a success response if the account was found.",
