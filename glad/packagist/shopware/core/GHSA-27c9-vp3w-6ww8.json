  "Title": "Shopware exposes sensitive user information via CSV export mapping",
  "Description": "Sensitive information disclosure occurs when an application inadvertently displays sensitive information to its users. Depending on the context, websites can leak all kinds of information including:\n• Data regarding other users, such as usernames and/or e-mail addresses\n• Sensitive commercial data such as customer names\n• Technical details about the website and/or the underlying infrastructure\nDisclosing technical details, such as detailed version information, allows malicious actors to look for targeted vulnerabilities and/or misconfigurations in the application or in the underlying infrastructure. In addition, an application is more likely to be targeted by attacks that specifically target a particular version of the software used.",
