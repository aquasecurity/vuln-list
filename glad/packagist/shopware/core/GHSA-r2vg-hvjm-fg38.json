  "Title": "Shopware Customer Orders can be canceled, even if refunds are disabled",
  "Description": "Refunds in general can be enabled through the administration setting `core.cart.enableOrderRefunds` (in the cart panel).Which visually shows and hides the button. However, using a custom crafted request, a customer can still cancel his own orders.As this is not checked inside the route (and also not in the controller):\n https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Storefront/Controller/AccountOrderController.php#L98 \n https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Core/Checkout/Order/SalesChannel/CancelOrderRoute.php \n\nTo mitigate this, a check should be added to the `CancelOrderRoute` which verifies that the feature is enabled.",
