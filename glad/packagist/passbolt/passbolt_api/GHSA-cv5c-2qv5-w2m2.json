  "Title": "Passbolt Api Remote code execution",
  "Description": "Passbolt provides a way for system administrators to generate a PGP key for the server during installation. The wizard requests a username, an e-mail address and an optional comment. No escaping or verification is done by Passbolt, effectively allowing a user to inject bash code.\n\nThe impact is very high, but the probability is very low given that this vulnerability can only be exploited during Passboltâ€™s installation stage.",
