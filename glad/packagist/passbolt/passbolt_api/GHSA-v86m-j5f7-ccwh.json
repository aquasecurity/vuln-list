  "PackageSlug": "packagist/passbolt/passbolt_api",
  "Title": "Passbolt Api E-mail HTML injection",
  "Description": "Passbolt sends e-mail to users to warn them about different type of events such as the creation, modification or deletion of a password. Those e-mails may contain user-specified input, such as a password’s title or description.\n\nPassbolt does not escape the user’s input properly, resulting in the user being able to inject HTML code in an e-mail.\n\nAn authenticated attacker could share a password containing an img HTML tag in its description with an other user to obtain information about their mail user-agent.\n\nThis vulnerability has a very low impact. Most MUA do not embed remote images to protect their users’ privacy.",
