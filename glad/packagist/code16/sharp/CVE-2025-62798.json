  "PackageSlug": "packagist/code16/sharp",
  "Title": "Sharp user-provided input can be evaluated in a SharpShowTextField with Vue template syntax",
  "Description": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp when rendering content using the SharpShowTextField component.\n\nIn affected versions, expressions wrapped in `{{` \u0026 `}}` were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that executes in the browser when the field is displayed.\n\nFor example, if a field’s value contains `{{ Math.random() }}`, it will be executed instead of being displayed as text.",
