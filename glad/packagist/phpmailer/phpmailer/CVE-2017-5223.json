  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-5223",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/phpmailer/phpmailer",
  "Title": "Local File Disclosure",
  "Description": "PHPMailer's `msgHTML` method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to `/`, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments.",
