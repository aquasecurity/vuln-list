  "Title": "Remote Code Execution (0day Patch Bypass/exploit)",
  "Description": "The patch for CVE-2016-10033 vulnerability added in PHPMailer sanitizes the `$Sender` variable by applying `escapeshellarg()` escaping before the value is passed to `mail()` function. It does not however take into account the clashing of the `escapeshellarg()` function with internal escaping with `escapeshellcmd()` performed by `mail()` function on the 5th parameter. As a result it is possible to inject an extra quote that does not get properly escaped and break out of the `escapeshellarg()` protection applied by the patch in PHPMailer ",
