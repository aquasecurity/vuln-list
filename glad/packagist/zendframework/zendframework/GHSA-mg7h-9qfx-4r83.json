  "Title": "ZendFramework Potential Proxy Injection Vulnerabilities",
  "Description": "`Zend\\Session\\Validator\\RemoteAddr` and `Zend\\View\\Helper\\ServerUrl` were found to be improperly parsing HTTP headers for proxy information, which could potentially allow an attacker to spoof a proxied IP or host name.\n\nIn `Zend\\Session\\Validator\\RemoteAddr`, if the client is behind a proxy server, the detection of the proxy URL was incorrect, and could lead to invalid results on subsequent lookups.\n\nIn `Zend\\View\\Helper\\ServerUrl`, if the server lives behind a proxy, the helper would always generate a URL based on the proxy host, regardless of whether or not this was desired; additionally, it did not take into account the proxy port or protocol, if provided.",
