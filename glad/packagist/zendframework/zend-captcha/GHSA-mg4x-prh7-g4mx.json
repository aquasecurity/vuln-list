  "Title": "Zend-Captcha Information Disclosure and Insufficient Entropy vulnerability",
  "Description": "In Zend Framework, `Zend_Captcha_Word` (v1) and `Zend\\Captcha\\Word` (v2) generate a \"word\" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random letters from a character set. Prior to this advisory, the selection was performed using PHP's internal `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy due to its usage of rand() instead of more cryptographically secure methods such as `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This could potentially lead to information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation.",
