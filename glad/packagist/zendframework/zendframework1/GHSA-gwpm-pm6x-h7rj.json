  "Title": "ZendFramework Cross-site Scripting vector in `Zend_Filter_StripTags`",
  "Description": "`Zend_Filter_StripTags` is a filtering class analogous to PHP's `strip_tags()` function. In addition to stripping HTML tags and selectively keeping those provided in a allowlist, it also provides the ability to allowlist specific attributes to retain per allowlisted tag.\n\nThe reporter discovered that attributes that contained allowspace, and in paricular, line breaks, surrounding the attribute assignment operator would not be stripped, regardless of whether or not they were allowlisted. As examples of input affected:\n```\n\u003c!-- newlines before and/or after assignment: --\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://framework.zend.com/issues\" onclick\n=\n\"alert('Broken'); return false;\"\u003eIssues\u003c/a\u003e\n```\nWhen passed to the following code:\n```\n$filter = new Zend_Filter_StripTags(array('a' =\u003e array('href')));\n$value  = $filter-\u003e($html);\n```\nthen the \"onclick\" attribute would remain, even though it was not specified in the tag's allowlist. This could open potential cross-site scripting attack (XSS) vectors.",
