  "Title": "ZendFramework potential XML eXternal Entity injection vectors",
  "Description": "Numerous components utilizing PHP's `DOMDocument`, `SimpleXML`, and `xml_parse` functionality are vulnerable to two types of attacks:\n\n- XML eXternal Entity (XXE) Injection attacks. The above mentioned extensions are insecure by default, allowing external entities to be specified by adding a specific DOCTYPE element to XML documents and strings. By exploiting this vulnerability an application may be coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP connections.\n- XML Entity Expansion (XEE) vectors, leading to Denial of Service vectors. XEE attacks occur when the XML DOCTYPE declaration includes XML entity definitions that contain either recursive or circular references; this leads to CPU and memory consumption, making Denial of Service exploits trivial to implement.",
