  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-54082",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/manogi/nova-tiptap",
  "Title": "nova-tiptap has Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability",
  "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap Laravel Nova package that allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to any Laravel disk configured in the application.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to:\n•\tMissing authentication middleware (Nova and Nova.Auth) on the /nova-tiptap/api/file upload endpoint\n•\tLack of validation on uploaded files (no MIME/type or extension restrictions)\n•\tAbility for an attacker to choose the disk parameter dynamically\n\nThis means an attacker can craft a custom form and send a POST request to /nova-tiptap/api/file, supplying a valid CSRF token, and upload executable or malicious files (e.g., .php, binaries) to public disks such as local, public, or s3. If a publicly accessible storage path is used (e.g. S3 with public access, or Laravel’s public disk), the attacker may gain the ability to execute or distribute arbitrary files — amounting to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector in some environments.",
