  "PackageSlug": "packagist/librenms/librenms",
  "Title": "LibreNMS has Authenticated Remote File Inclusion in ajax_form.php that Allows RCE",
  "Description": "LibreNMS 25.6.0 contains an architectural vulnerability in the `ajax_form.php` endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input.\n\nThe application directly uses the `type` parameter to dynamically include `.inc.php` files from the trusted path `includes/html/forms/`, without validation or allowlisting:\n\n```php\nif (file_exists('includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php')) {\ninclude_once 'includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php';\n}\n```\nThis pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path â€” for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities.\n\n\u003e  This is not an arbitrary file upload bug. But it does provide a powerful execution sink for attackers with write access (direct or indirect) to the include directory.",
