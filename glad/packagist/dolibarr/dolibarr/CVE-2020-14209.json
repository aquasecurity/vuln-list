  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-14209",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/dolibarr/dolibarr",
  "Title": "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type",
  "Description": "Dolibarr allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types, leading to arbitrary code execution. This occurs because `.pht` and `.phar` files can be uploaded. Also, an `.htaccess` file can be uploaded to reconfigure access control (e.g., to let `.noexe` files be executed as PHP code to defeat the `.noexe` protection mechanism).",
