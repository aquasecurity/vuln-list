  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-11201",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/dolibarr/dolibarr",
  "Title": "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')",
  "Description": "Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a module named website that provides for creation of public websites with a WYSIWYG editor. It was identified that the editor also allowed inclusion of dynamic code, which can lead to code execution on the host machine. An attacker has to check a setting on the same page, which specifies the inclusion of dynamic content. Thus, a lower privileged user of the application can execute code under the context and permissions of the underlying web server.",
