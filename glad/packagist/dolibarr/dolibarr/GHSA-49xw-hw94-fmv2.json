  "Title": "Dolibarr has Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Bypass)",
  "Description": "The Dolibarr backend provides the function of adding Menu, and supports setting permissions for the added Menu:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh0amitx/Misc/main/images/image-20240228164114688.png)\n\nThis is the trigger point of the vulnerability. The submitted permission can be php code, and it will be executed when viewing the created Menu:\n\n- htdocs/admin/menus/edit.php\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh0amitx/Misc/main/images/image-20240228164445656.png)\n\nAs you can see, in edit.php, if the created menu is set to `$menu-\u003eperms`, the `dol_eval()` method will be called. Following the `dol_eval()` method, we can see that it will filter the dangerous php functions in `$menu-\u003eperms` through the blocklist set in `$forbiddenphpfunctions`:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wh0amitx/Misc/main/images/image-20240228164725548.png)\n\nHowever, the blocklist here is not comprehensive. For example, the `include_once` and `require_once` functions can easily pass the blocklist check, which will cause file inclusion vulnerabilities. Moreover, if the `allow_url_include` option is enabled in php.ini, arbitrary code execution will occur. **The most serious thing is that we can cooperate with the file upload at `/htdocs/user/document.php?id=1\u0026uploadform=1` to achieve more general arbitrary code execution.**",
