  "PackageSlug": "packagist/friendsofsymfony/user-bundle",
  "Title": "FOSUserBundle Entropy is lost in the TokenGenerator",
  "Description": "Because of the usage of base_convert which looses precision for large inputs, the entropy of tokens generated by FOSUserBundle for the email confirmation and password resetting is lost. This makes these tokens much less random than they are expected to be, and so not cryptographically safe.",
