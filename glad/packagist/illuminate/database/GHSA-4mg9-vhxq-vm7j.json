  "Title": "SQL Server LIMIT / OFFSET SQL Injection in laravel/framework and illuminate/database",
  "Description": "### Impact\n\nThose using SQL Server with Laravel and allowing user input to be passed directly to the `limit` and `offset` functions is vulnerable to SQL injection. Other database drivers such as MySQL and Postgres are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been patched on Laravel versions 6.20.26, 7.30.5, and 8.40.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou may workaround this vulnerability by ensuring that only integers are passed to the `limit` and `offset` functions, as well as the `skip` and `take` functions.\n",
