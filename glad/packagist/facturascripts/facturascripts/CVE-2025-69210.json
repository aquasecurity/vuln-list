  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-69210",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/facturascripts/facturascripts",
  "Title": "FacturaScripts is Vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via XML File Upload",
  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the product file upload functionality.\n\nAuthenticated users can upload crafted XML files containing executable JavaScript. These files are later rendered by the application without sufficient sanitization or content-type enforcement, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution when the file is accessed.\n\nBecause product files uploaded by regular users are visible to administrative users, this vulnerability can be leveraged to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser session.",
