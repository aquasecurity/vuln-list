  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-56329",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/joelbutcher/socialstream",
  "Title": "Socialstream has a Potential Account Takeover Vulnerability in Social Account Linking Due to Missing User Consent After OAuth Callback",
  "Description": "When linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if -\u003estateless() is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks.",
