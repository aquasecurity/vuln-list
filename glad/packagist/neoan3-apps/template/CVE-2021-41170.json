  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41170",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/neoan3-apps/template",
  "Title": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource",
  "Description": "neoan3-apps/template allows for passing in closures directly into the template engine. As a result, values that are callable are executed by the template engine. The issue arises if a value has the same name as a method or function in scope and can therefore be executed either by mistake or maliciously. In theory all users of the package are affected as long as they either deal with direct user input or database values.",
