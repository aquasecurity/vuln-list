  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-49762",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pterodactyl/panel",
  "Title": "Pterodactyl Panel has plain-text logging of user passwords when two-factor authentication is disabled",
  "Description": "When a user disables two-factor authentication via the Panel, a `DELETE` request with their current password in a query parameter will be sent.  While query parameters are encrypted when using TLS, many webservers (including ones officially documented for use with Pterodactyl) will log query parameters in plain-text, storing a user's password in plain text.\n\nIf a malicious user obtains access to these logs they could *potentially* authenticate against a user's account; assuming they are able to discover the account's email address or username **separately**.",
