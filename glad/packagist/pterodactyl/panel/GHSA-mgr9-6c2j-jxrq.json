  "Title": "Pterodactyl has a Reflected XSS vulnerability in “Create New Database Host”",
  "Description": "When an administrative user creates a new database host they are prompted to provide a `Host` value which is expected to be a domain or IP address. When an invalid value is encountered and passed back to `gethostaddr` and/or directly to the MySQL connection tooling, an error is returned. This error is then passed back along to the front-end, but was not properly sanitized when rendered.\n\nTherefore it is possible for an admin to _knowingly_ paste a malicious payload such as `\u003cscript\u003eprompt(document.domain)\u003c/script\u003e` into the `Host` field and XSS themselves.",
