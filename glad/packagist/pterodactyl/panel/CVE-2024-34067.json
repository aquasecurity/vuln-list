Specifically, the following things are impacted:\n- Egg Docker images\n- Egg variables:\n- Name\n- Environment variable\n- Default value\n- Description\n- Validation rules\n\nAdditionally, certain fields would reflect malicious input, but it would require the user knowingly entering such input to have an impact.\n\nTo iterate, this would require an administrator to perform actions and can't be triggered by a normal panel user.",
