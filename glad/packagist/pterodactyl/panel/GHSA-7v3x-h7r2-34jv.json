  "Title": "Insufficient Session Expiration in Pterodactyl API",
  "Description": "### Impact\nA vulnerability exists in Pterodactyl Panel `\u003c= 1.6.6` that could allow a malicious attacker that compromises an API key to generate an authenticated user session that is not revoked when the API key is deleted, thus allowing the malicious user to remain logged in as the user the key belonged to.\n\nIt is important to note that **a malicious user must first compromise an existing API key for a user to exploit this issue**. It cannot be exploited by chance, and requires a coordinated attack against an individual account using a known API key.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been addressed in the `v1.7.0` release of Pterodactyl Panel.\n\n### Workarounds\nThose not wishing to upgrade may apply the change below:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/Http/Middleware/Api/AuthenticateKey.php b/app/Http/Middleware/Api/AuthenticateKey.php\nindex eb25dac6..857bfab2 100644\n--- a/app/Http/Middleware/Api/AuthenticateKey.php\n+++ b/app/Http/Middleware/Api/AuthenticateKey.php\n@@ -70,7 +70,7 @@ class AuthenticateKey\n         } else {\n             $model = $this-\u003eauthenticateApiKey($request-\u003ebearerToken(), $keyType);\n\n-            $this-\u003eauth-\u003eguard()-\u003eloginUsingId($model-\u003euser_id);\n+            $this-\u003eauth-\u003eguard()-\u003eonceUsingId($model-\u003euser_id);\n         }\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please reach out to `Tactical Fish#8008` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl) or email `dane@pterodactyl.io`.\n",
