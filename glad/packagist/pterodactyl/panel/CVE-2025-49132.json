  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pterodactyl/panel",
  "Title": "Pterodactyl Panel Allows Unauthenticated Arbitrary Remote Code Execution",
  "Description": "Using the `/locales/locale.json` with the `locale` and `namespace` query parameters, a malicious actor is able to execute arbitrary code, without being authenticated.\n\nWith the ability to execute arbitrary code, this vulnerability can be exploited in an infinite number of ways.  It could be used to gain access to the Panel's server, read credentials from the Panel's config (`.env` or otherwise), extract sensitive information from the database (such as user details [username, email, first and last name, hashed password, ip addresses, etc]), access files of servers managed by the panel, etc.",
