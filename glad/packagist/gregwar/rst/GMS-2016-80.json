  "Description": "Gregwar is vulnerable to local file inclusion when including RST templates.",
  "Date": "2016-10-31",
  "Pubdate": "2016-10-31",
  "AffectedRange": "\u003c1.0.3",
  "FixedVersions": [
    "v1.0.3"
  ],
  "AffectedVersions": "All versions before 1.0.3",
  "NotImpacted": "",
  "Solution": "Upgrade to version 1.0.3 and set the \"include\" parameter according to your needs. If you're loading RST templates from a database, disable include. If you're loading RST templates from the filesystem and need include for snippets, jail all includes to within a common directory.",
