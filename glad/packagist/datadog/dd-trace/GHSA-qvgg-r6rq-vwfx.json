  "Description": "datadog/dd-trace versions 0.30.0 prior to 0.30.2 are affected by a security and stability issue outlined in PR [#579](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/pull/579). This pull request ensures that the ddtrace.request_init_hook remains bound by the open_basedir INI directive, effectively addressing potential vulnerabilities related to open_basedir restrictions.\nThe update introduces a sandboxing mechanism to isolate the request init hook from errors or exceptions during execution, enhancing the library's stability and preventing adverse impacts on the main script.",
