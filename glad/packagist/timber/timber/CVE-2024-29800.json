  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-29800",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/timber/timber",
  "Title": "timber/timber vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "Timber is vulnerable to [PHAR deserialization](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting#phar-deserialization) due to a lack of checking the input before passing it into the` file_exists()` function. If an attacker can upload files of any type to the server, he can pass in the `phar://` protocol to unserialize the uploaded file and instantiate arbitrary PHP objects. This can lead to remote code execution especially when Timber is used with frameworks with documented POP chains like Wordpress/ vulnerable developer code.",
