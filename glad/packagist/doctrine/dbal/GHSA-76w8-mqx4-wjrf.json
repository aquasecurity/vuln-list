  "Description": "The identifier quoting in Doctrine DBAL has a potential security problem when user-input is passed into this function, making the security aspect of this functionality obsolete.\nIf you make use of AbstractPlatform::quoteIdentifier() or Doctrine::quoteIdentifier() please upgrade immediately. The ORM itself does not use identifier quoting in combination with user-input, however we still urge everyone to update to the latest version of DBAL.",
