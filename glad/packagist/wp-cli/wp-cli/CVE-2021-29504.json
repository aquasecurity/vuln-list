  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-29504",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/wp-cli/wp-cli",
  "Title": "Improper Certificate Validation",
  "Description": "WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI allows remote attackers able to intercept the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on WP-CLI side, gaining full control over the communication content, including the ability to impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards WordPress instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push malicious updates toward WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default behavior of `WP_CLI\\Utils\\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable certificate validation and retry the same request.",
