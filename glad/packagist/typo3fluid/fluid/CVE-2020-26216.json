  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26216",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/typo3fluid/fluid",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting",
  "Description": "TYPO3 Fluid is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Three XSS vulnerabilities have been detected in Fluid - `TagBasedViewHelper` allowed XSS through maliciously crafted additionalAttributes arrays by creating keys with attribute-closing quotes followed by HTML. When rendering such attributes, `TagBuilder` would not escape the keys. `ViewHelpers` which used the `CompileWithContentArgumentAndRenderStatic` trait, and which declared escapeOutput = false, would receive the content argument in unescaped format. Subclasses of `AbstractConditionViewHelper` would receive the then and else arguments in unescaped format. More details are available in the linked advisory.",
