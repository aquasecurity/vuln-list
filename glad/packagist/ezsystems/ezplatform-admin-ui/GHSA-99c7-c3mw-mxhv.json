Back office access and varying levels of editing and management permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability. This typically means Editor or Administrator role, or similar. Injected XSS is persistent and may in some cases be reflected in the front office, possibly affecting end users. The fixes ensure XSS is escaped, and any existing injected XSS is rendered harmless.",
