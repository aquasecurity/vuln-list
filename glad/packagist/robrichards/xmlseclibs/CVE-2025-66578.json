  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-66578",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/robrichards/xmlseclibs",
  "Title": "robrichards/xmlseclibs has an Libxml2 Canonicalization error which can bypass Digest/Signature validation",
  "Description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the libxml2 canonicalization process, which is used by [xmlseclibs](https://github.com/robrichards/xmlseclibs) during document transformation. This weakness allows an attacker to generate a valid signature once and reuse it indefinitely. In practice, a signature created during a previous interaction - or through a misconfigured authentication flow - can be replayed to bypass authentication checks.",
