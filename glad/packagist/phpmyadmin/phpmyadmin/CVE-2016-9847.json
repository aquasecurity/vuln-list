  "PackageSlug": "packagist/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin",
  "Title": "Cryptographic Issues",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify a `blowfish_secret` key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one at runtime. A vulnerability was reported where the way this value is created uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to determine the user's `blowfish_secret` and potentially decrypt their cookies.",
