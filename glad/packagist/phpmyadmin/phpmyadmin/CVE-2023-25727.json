  "PackageSlug": "packagist/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin",
  "Title": "Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in drag-and-drop upload of phpMyAdmin",
  "Description": "In phpMyAdmin before 4.9.11 and 5.x before 5.2.1, an authenticated user can trigger Cross-site Scripting (XSS) by uploading a crafted .sql file through the drag-and-drop interface. By disabling the configuration directive `$cfg['enable_drag_drop_import']`, users will be unable to use the drag and drop upload which would protect against the vulnerability.",
