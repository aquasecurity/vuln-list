  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-67510",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/neuron-core/neuron-ai",
  "Title": "Neuron MySQLWriteTool allows arbitrary/destructive SQL when exposed to untrusted prompts (agent “footgun”)",
  "Description": "`MySQLWriteTool` executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using `PDO::prepare()` + `execute()` without semantic restrictions.\n\nThis is consistent with the name (“write tool”), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER`, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions).\n\n\n\n**Who is impacted:** Deployments that expose an agent with `MySQLWriteTool` enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges.",
