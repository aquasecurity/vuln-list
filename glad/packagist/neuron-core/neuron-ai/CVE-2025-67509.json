  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-67509",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/neuron-core/neuron-ai",
  "Title": "Neuron MySQLSelectTool “read-only” bypass via `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` (file write → potential RCE)",
  "Description": "`MySQLSelectTool` is intended to be a read-only SQL tool (e.g., for LLM agent querying). However, validation based on the first keyword (e.g., `SELECT`) and a forbidden-keyword list does not block file-writing constructs such as `INTO OUTFILE` / `INTO DUMPFILE`.\n\nAs a result, an attacker who can influence the tool input (e.g., prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may be able to write arbitrary content to files on the DB server.\n\nIf the MySQL/MariaDB account has the `FILE` privilege and server configuration permits writes to a useful location (e.g., a web-accessible directory), the impact can escalate to remote code execution on the application host (for example, by writing a PHP web shell).\n\n**Who is impacted:** Deployments that expose an agent using `MySQLSelectTool` to untrusted input and run with overly-permissive DB privileges/configuration.",
