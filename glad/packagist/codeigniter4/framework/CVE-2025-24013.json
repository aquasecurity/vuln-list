  "PackageSlug": "packagist/codeigniter4/framework",
  "Title": "Missing validation of header name and value in codeigniter4/framework",
  "Description": "Lack of proper header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with `Header` class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote serviceâ€™s web application firewall interprets them as malicious and blocks further communication with the application.",
