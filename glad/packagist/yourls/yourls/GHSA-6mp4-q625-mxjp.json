  "Title": "YOURLS is vulnerable to XSS through JSONP and Callback request parameters",
  "Description": "The callback and **jsonp** request parameters are directly concatenated into the response without any sanitization that allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JS code. When **YOURLS_PRIVATE** is set to **false** (public API mode), this vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated attacker. In private mode, the XSS payload is still injected into the 403 response body though browser execution is blocked.",
