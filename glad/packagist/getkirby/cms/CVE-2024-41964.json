  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-41964",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/getkirby/cms",
  "Title": "Kirby has insufficient permission checks in the language settings",
  "Description": "The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to manipulate the language definitions.\n\nThe language definitions are at the core of multi-language content in Kirby. Unauthorized modifications with malicious intent can cause significant damage, for example:\n\n- If the `languages` option was enabled but no language exists, creating the first language will switch Kirby to multi-language mode.\n- Deleting an existing language will lead to content loss of all translated content in that language. Deleting the last language will switch Kirby to single-language mode.\n- Updating a language allows to change the metadata including the language slug (used in page URLs) and language variables. It also allows to change the default language, which will cause Kirby to use the new default language's content as a fallback for non-existing translations.\n\nDepending on the site code, the result of such actions can cause loss of site availability (e.g. error messages in the site frontend) or integrity (due to changed URLs or removed translations).",
