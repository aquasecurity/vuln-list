  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-30207",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/getkirby/cms",
  "Title": "Kirby vulnerable to path traversal in the router for PHP's built-in server",
  "Description": "The missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the Kirby installation.\n\nThe vulnerable implementation delegated all existing files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists.\n\nBecause Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid.",
