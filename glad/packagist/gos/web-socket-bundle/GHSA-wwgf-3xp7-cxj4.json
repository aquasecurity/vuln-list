  "Title": "Potentially sensitive data exposure in Symfony Web Socket Bundle",
  "Description": "### Impact\nInside `Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Server\\App\\Dispatcher\\TopicDispatcher::onPublish()`, messages are arbitrarily broadcasted to the related Topic if `Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Server\\App\\Dispatcher\\TopicDispatcher::dispatch()` does not succeed.  The `dispatch()` method can be considered to not succeed if (depending on the version of the bundle) the callback defined on a topic route is misconfigured, a `Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Topic\\TopicInterface` implementation is not found for the callback, a topic which also implements `Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Topic\\SecuredTopicInterface` rejects the connection, or an Exception is unhandled.  This can result in an unintended broadcast to the websocket server potentially with data that should be considered sensitive.\n\n### Patches\nIn 1.10.4, 2.6.1, and 3.3.0, `Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Server\\App\\Dispatcher\\TopicDispatcher::onPublish()` has been changed to no longer broadcast an event's data if `Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Server\\App\\Dispatcher\\TopicDispatcher::dispatch()` fails.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to 1.10.4, 2.6.1, and 3.3.0\n\nNote, the 1.x branch is considered end of support as of July 1, 2020.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/GeniusesOfSymfony/WebSocketBundle)",
