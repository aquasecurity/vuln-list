  "Title": "Duplicate of ./packagist/typo3/cms-core/CVE-2022-23500.yml",
  "Description": "### Problem\nRequesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler, which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.\n\nThis vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one described in `TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005` (CVE-2021-21359).\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33 or 11.5.20 that fix the problem described above.",
