  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-47939",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/typo3/cms-core",
  "Title": "TYPO3 Allows Unrestricted File Upload in File Abstraction Layer",
  "Description": "### Problem\nBy design, the file management module in TYPO3â€™s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of any file type, with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context. This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially harmful, such as executable binaries (e.g., `.exe` files), or files with inconsistent file extensions and MIME types (for example, a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`).\n\nAlthough such files are not directly executable through the web server, their presence can introduce indirect risks. For example, third-party services such as antivirus scanners or malware detection systems might flag or block access to the website for end users if suspicious files are found. This could negatively affect the availability or reputation of the site.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.",
