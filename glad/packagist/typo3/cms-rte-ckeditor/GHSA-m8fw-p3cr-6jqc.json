  "Title": "Cross-Site Scripting in CKEditor4 WordCount Plugin",
  "Description": "\u003e ### CVSS: `.4) \n\n### Problem\nThe [WordCount](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wordcount) plugin ([`npm:ckeditor-wordcount-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor-wordcount-plugin)) for CKEditor4 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when switching to the source code mode. This plugin is enabled via the `Full.yaml` configuration present, but is not active in the default configuration.\n\nIn default scenarios, exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. However, if custom plugins are used on the website frontend, which accept and reflect rich-text content submitted by users, no authentication is required.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Sybille Peters who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core \u0026 security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-004](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-004)\n* https://github.com/w8tcha/CKEditor-WordCount-Plugin/security/advisories/GHSA-q9w4-w667-qqj4",
