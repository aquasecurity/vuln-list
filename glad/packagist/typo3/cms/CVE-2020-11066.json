  "PackageSlug": "packagist/typo3/cms",
  "Title": "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes",

It can also trigger message submission via email using the identity of the website (mail relay). Another insecure deserialization vulnerability is required to actually exploit mentioned aspects.",
