  "Title": "TYPO3 frontend login vulnerable to Session Fixation",
  "Description": "It has been discovered that TYPO3 is susceptible to session fixation. If a user authenticates while anonymous session data is present, the session id is not changed. This makes it possible for attackers to generate a valid session id, trick users into using this session id (e.g. by leveraging a different Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability) and then maybe getting access to an authenticated session.",
