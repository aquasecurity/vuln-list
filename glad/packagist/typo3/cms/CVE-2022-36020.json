  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-36020",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/typo3/cms",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
  "Description": "The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
