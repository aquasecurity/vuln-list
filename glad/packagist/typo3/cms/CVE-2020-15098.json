  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15098",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/typo3/cms",
  "Title": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "Description": "In TYPO3 CMS, it has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege escalation, insecure deserialization \u0026 remote code execution. The overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated).",
