  "Title": "Authentication Bypass in TYPO3 CMS",
  "Description": "The default authentication service misses to invalidate empty strings as password. Therefore it is possible to authenticate backend and frontend users without password set in the database.\nNote: TYPO3 does not allow to create user accounts without a password. Your TYPO3 installation might only be affected if there is a third party component creating user accounts without password by directly manipulating the database.",
