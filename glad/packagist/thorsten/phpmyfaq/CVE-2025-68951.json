  "PackageSlug": "packagist/thorsten/phpmyfaq",
  "Title": "phpMyFAQ has Stored XSS in user list via admin-managed display_name",
  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in an administrator’s browser by registering a user whose **display name** contains HTML entities (e.g., `\u0026lt;img ...\u0026gt;`). When an administrator views the admin user list, the payload is decoded server-side and rendered without escaping, resulting in script execution in the admin context.",
