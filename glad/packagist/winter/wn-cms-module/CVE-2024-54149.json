  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-54149",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/winter/wn-cms-module",
  "Title": "Winter CMS Modules allows a sandbox bypass in Twig templates leading to data modification and deletion",
  "Description": "Affected versions of Winter CMS allow users with access to the CMS templates sections that modify Twig files to bypass the sandbox placed on Twig files and modify resources such as theme customisation values or modify, or remove, templates in the theme even if not provided direct access via the permissions.\n\nAs all objects passed through to Twig are references to the live objects, it is also possible to also manipulate model data if models are passed directly to Twig, including changing attributes or even removing records entirely. In most cases, this is unwanted behavior and potentially dangerous.\n\nTo actively exploit this security issue, an attacker would need access to the Backend with a user account with any of the following permissions:\n- `cms.manage_layouts`\n- `cms.manage_pages`\n- `cms.manage_partials`\n\nThe Winter CMS maintainers strongly recommend that these permissions only be reserved to trusted administrators and developers in general.",
