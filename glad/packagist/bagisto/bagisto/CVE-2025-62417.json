  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-62417",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/bagisto/bagisto",
  "Title": "bagisto has CSV Formula Injection in Create New Product",
  "Description": "When product data that begins with a spreadsheet formula character (for example =, +, -, or @) is accepted and later exported or saved into a CSV and opened in spreadsheet software, the spreadsheet will interpret that cell as a formula. This allows an attacker to supply a CSV field (e.g., product name) that contains a formula which may be evaluated by a victim’s spreadsheet application — potentially leading to data exfiltration and remote command execution (via older Excel exploits / OLE/cmd constructs or Excel macros).",
