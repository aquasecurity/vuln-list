  "Description": "## usd-2024-0009 | Reflected XSS in Oveleon Cookiebar\n\n### Details\n**Advisory ID**: usd-2024-0009 \n**Product**: Cookiebar   \n**Affected Version**: 2.X  \n**Vulnerability Type**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')   \n**Security Risk**: HIGH, CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N   \n**Vendor URL**: https://www.usd.de/    \n**Vendor acknowledged vulnerability**: Yes    \n**Vendor Status**: Fixed   \n**CVE Number**: Not requested yet    \n**CVE Link**: Not requested yet    \n**First Published**: Published  \n**Last Update**: 2024-07-29\n\n\n### Affected Component\n\nThe `block` function in `CookiebarController.php`.\n\n\n### Desciption\n\nOveleon's Cookiebar is an extension for the popular Contao CMS.\nThe `block/locale` endpoint does not properly sanitize the user-controlled `locale` input before including it in the backend's HTTP response, thereby causing reflected XSS.\n\n### Proof of Concept\nThe vulnerability could be triggered by entering the following Link:\n\n```\nhttps://[redacted].de/cookiebar/block/dens82w%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(1)%3Ew9qt\nn/[id]?redirect=https%3A%2F%2F[...]amp%3Biv_load_policy%3D3%26amp%3Bmo\ndestbranding%3D1%26amp%3Brel%3D0\n```\n\nIt is likely related to the following function in the Oveleon Cookiebar source code:\n\n```php\n    /**\n     * Block content\n     *\n     * @Route(\"/cookiebar/block/{locale}/{id}\", name=\"cookiebar_block\")\n     */\n    public function block(Request $request, string $locale, int $id): Response\n    {\n        System::loadLanguageFile('tl_cookiebar', $locale);\n\n        $this-\u003eframework-\u003einitialize();\n\n        $objCookie = CookieModel::findById($id);\n\n        if (null === $objCookie || null === $request-\u003eheaders-\u003eget('referer'))\n        {\n            throw new PageNotFoundException();\n        }\n\n        $strUrl = $request-\u003eget('redirect');\n\n        // Protect against XSS attacks\n        if(!Validator::isUrl($strUrl))\n        {\n            return new Response('The redirect destination must be a valid URL.', Response::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST);\n        }\n\n        $objTemplate = new FrontendTemplate($objCookie-\u003eblockTemplate ?: 'ccb_element_blocker');\n\n        $objTemplate-\u003elanguage = $locale;\n        $objTemplate-\u003eid = $objCookie-\u003eid;\n        $objTemplate-\u003etitle = $objCookie-\u003etitle;\n        $objTemplate-\u003etype = $objCookie-\u003etype;\n        $objTemplate-\u003eiframeType = $objCookie-\u003eiframeType;\n        $objTemplate-\u003edescription = $objCookie-\u003eblockDescription;\n        $objTemplate-\u003eredirect = $request-\u003eget('redirect');\n        $objTemplate-\u003eacceptAndDisplayLabel = $this-\u003etranslator-\u003etrans('tl_cookiebar.acceptAndDisplayLabel', [], 'contao_default', $locale);\n\n        return $objTemplate-\u003egetResponse();\n    }\n```\n\n### Fix\nSanitize the `locale` input to prevent XSS payloads from being executed in a user's browser.\n\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/oveleon/contao-cookiebar/blob/2.x/src/Controller/CookiebarController.php\n- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\n\n\n### Timeline\n* **2024-04-24**: Vulnerability discovered by DR of usd AG.\n* **2024-07-25**: Probable cause of the vulnerability has been identified as Oveleon's Cookiebar Extension for Contao CMS.\n* **2024-07-25**: Vulnerability disclosed via GitHub Vulnerability Report.\n\n\n### Credits\nThis security vulnerability was identified by DR of usd AG.\n\n\n### About usd Security Advisories\nIn order to protect businesses against hackers and criminals, we always have to keep our skills and knowledge up to date.
