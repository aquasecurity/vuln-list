  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-8678",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/johnbillion/wp-crontrol",
  "Title": "WP Crontrol Authenticated (Administrator+) plugin vulnerable to Blind Server-Side Request Forgery",
  "Description": "The WP Crontrol plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Blind Server-Side Request Forgery in versions 1.17.0 to 1.19.1 via the `wp_remote_request()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.\n\nIt is not possible for a user without Administrator level access to exploit this weakness. It is not possible for an Administrator performing an attack to see the HTTP response to the request to their chosen URL, nor is it possible for them to time the response.",
