  "PackageSlug": "packagist/johnbillion/wp-crontrol",
  "Title": "WP Crontrol vulnerable to possible RCE when combined with a pre-condition",
  "Description": "WP Crontrol includes a feature that allows administrative users to create events in the WP-Cron system that store and execute PHP code [subject to the restrictive security permissions documented here](https://wp-crontrol.com/docs/php-cron-events/). While there is _no known vulnerability in this feature on its own_, there exists potential for this feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were specifically targeted via vulnerability chaining that exploited a separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability.\n\nThis is exploitable on a site if one of the below preconditions are met:\n\n* The site is vulnerable to a writeable SQLi vulnerability in any plugin, theme, or WordPress core\n* The site's database is compromised at the hosting level\n* The site is vulnerable to a method of updating arbitrary options in the `wp_options` table\n* The site is vulnerable to a method of triggering an arbitrary action, filter, or function with control of the parameters",
