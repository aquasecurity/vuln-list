  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-15133",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/laravel/framework",
  "Title": "Laravel Framework RCE Vulnerability",
  "Description": "In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value. This involves the decrypt method in `Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php` and PendingBroadcast in `gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php` in phpggc. The attacker must know the application key, which normally would never occur, but could happen if the attacker previously had privileged access or successfully accomplished a previous attack.",
