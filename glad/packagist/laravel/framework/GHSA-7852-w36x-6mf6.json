  "Title": "Laravel Encrypter Component Potential Decryption Failure Leading to Unintended Behavior",
  "Description": "The Laravel Encrypter component is susceptible to a vulnerability that may result in decryption failure, leading to an unexpected return of `false`. Exploiting this issue requires the attacker to manipulate the encrypted payload before decryption. When combined with weak type comparisons in the application's code, such as the example below:\n\n```\n\u003c?php\n\n$decyptedValue = decrypt($secret);\n\nif ($decryptedValue == '') {\n// Code is run even though decrypted value is false...\n}\n```",
