  "Title": "Drupal Anonymous Open Redirect",
  "Description": "Drupal core and contributed modules frequently use a \"destination\" query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to a new destination after completing an action on the current page. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.",
