  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-6927",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/drupal/drupal",
  "Title": "JavaScript cross-site scripting prevention is incomplete",
  "Description": "Drupal has a Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to escape potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript output is not auto-escaped by either Drupal 7 or Drupal 8). This function does not correctly handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances. The PHP functions which Drupal provides for HTML escaping are not affected.",
