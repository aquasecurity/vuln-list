  "Title": "Drupal core Access bypass",
  "Description": "The Media Library module has a security vulnerability whereby it doesn't sufficiently restrict access to media items in certain configurations.\n\nSolution:\nIf you are using Drupal 8.7.x, you should upgrade to Drupal 8.7.11.\nIf you are using Drupal 8.8.x, you should upgrade to Drupal 8.8.1.\nVersions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.7.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage.\n\nAlternatively, you may mitigate this vulnerability by unchecking the \"Enable advanced UI\" checkbox on `/admin/config/media/media-library`. (This mitigation is not available in 8.7.x.)",
