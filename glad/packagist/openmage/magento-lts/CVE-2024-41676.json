  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-41676",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/openmage/magento-lts",
  "Title": "Magento LTS vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in admin system configs",
  "Description": "This XSS vulnerability is about the system configs\n* design/header/welcome\n* design/header/logo_src\n* design/header/logo_src_small\n* design/header/logo_alt\n\nThey are intended to enable admins to set a text in the two cases, and to define an image url for the other two cases.\nBut because of previously missing escaping allowed to input arbitrary html and as a consequence also arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nWhile this is in most usage scenarios not a relevant issue, some people work with more restrictive roles in the backend. Here the ability to inject JavaScript with these settings would be an unintended and unwanted privilege.",
