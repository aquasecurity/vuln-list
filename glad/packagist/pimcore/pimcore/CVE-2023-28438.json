  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-28438",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pimcore/pimcore",
  "Title": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')",
  "Description": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior to version 10.5.19, since a user with 'report' permission can already write arbitrary SQL queries and given the fact that this endpoint is using the GET method (no CSRF protection), an attacker can inject an arbitrary query by manipulating a user to click on a link. Users should upgrade to version 10.5.19 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, may apply the patch manually.",
