  "Title": "PhpSpreadsheet allows bypass XSS sanitizer using the javascript protocol and special characters",
  "Description": "# Bypass XSS sanitizer using the javascript protocol and special characters\n\n**Product**: Phpspreadsheet\n**Version**: version 3.6.0\n**CWE-ID**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**CVSS vector v.3.1**: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)\n**CVSS vector v.4.0**: 4.8 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N)\n**Description**: an attacker can use special characters, so that the library processes the javascript protocol with special characters and generates an HTML link\n**Impact**: executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser\n**Vulnerable component**: class `PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html`, method `generateRow`\n**Exploitation conditions**: a user viewing a specially generated Excel file\n**Mitigation**: additional sanitization of special characters in a string\n**Researcher**: Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies)\n\n# Research\n\nThe researcher discovered zero-day vulnerability Bypass XSS sanitizer using the javascript protocol and special characters in Phpspreadsheet.\n\nThe following code is written on the server, which translates the XLSX file into a HTML representation and displays it in the response.\n\n*Listing 6. Source code on the server*\n\n```\n\u003c?php\n\nrequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n$inputFileName = './doc/Book1.xlsx';\n$spreadsheet = \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\IOFactory::load($inputFileName);\n$writer = new \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html($spreadsheet);\nprint($writer-\u003egenerateHTMLAll());\n```\n\nAn attacker can use special characters so that this library processes the javascript protocol with special characters and generates a HTML link.\nThe Excel file is unpacked and a hyperlink in the file is inserted into the `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml` file.\n\n![fig11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9d53f7a-6f36-4853-95f9-8aa22f81eccd)\n\n*Figure 11. Using the javascript protocol with special characters*\n\nSome payloads help bypass the security system and carry out a XSS attack.\n\n*Listing 7. HTML form that demonstrates the exploitation of the XSS vulnerability*\n\n```\njav\u0026#x09;ascript:alert()\njav\u0026#x0D;ascript:alert()\njav\u0026#x0A;ascript:alert()\n```\n\nIt's clear that the javascript protocol with special characters is used. \n\n![fig12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7595e88b-9848-4251-845c-2c2d8032e479)\n\n*Figure 12. Using the javascript protocol with special characters*\n\nDue to the special characters, the execution stream ends up on line 1543, and the link is built in HTML form with the javascript protocol.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"373\" alt=\"fig13\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ca0c3c6-daa9-4502-ad9e-b803f308fd26\" /\u003e\n\n*Figure 13.
