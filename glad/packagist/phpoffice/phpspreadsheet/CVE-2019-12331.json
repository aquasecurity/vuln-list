  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-12331",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet",
  "Title": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference",
  "Description": "PHPOffice `PhpSpreadsheet` has an XXE issue. The `XmlScanner` decodes the `sheet1.xml` from an `.xlsx` to utf-8 if something else than UTF-8 is declared in the header. This was a security measurement to prevent CVE-2018-19277 but the fix is not sufficient. By double-encoding the the xml payload to utf-7 it is possible to bypass the check for the string `?\u003c!ENTITY?` and thus allowing for an xml external entity processing (XXE) attack.",
