  "Title": "PhpSpreadsheet has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties",
  "Description": "# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties\n\n**Product**: Phpspreadsheet\n**Version**: version 3.6.0\n**CWE-ID**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**CVSS vector v.3.1**: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)\n**CVSS vector v.4.0**: 4.8 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N)\n**Description**: the HTML page is generated without clearing custom properties\n**Impact**: executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser\n**Vulnerable component**: class `PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html`, method `generateMeta`\n**Exploitation conditions**: a user viewing a specially generated Excel file\n**Mitigation**: additional sanitization of special characters in a string\n**Researcher**: Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies)\n\n# Research\n\nThe researcher discovered zero-day vulnerability Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties in Phpspreadsheet.\nThe following code is written on the server, which translates the XLSX file into a HTML representation and displays it in the response.\n\n*Listing 9. Source code on the server*\n\n```\n\u003c?php\n\nrequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n$inputFileName = './doc/Book1.xlsx';\n$spreadsheet = \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\IOFactory::load($inputFileName);\n$writer = new \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html($spreadsheet);\nprint($writer-\u003egenerateHTMLAll());\n```\n\nAn attacker can embed a payload in a file property that will result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.\nThe Excel file is unpacked and a custom property in the file is inserted into the `docProps/custom.xml` file.\n\n![fig17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65453b48-bca5-4f5c-a683-315a7bb1ab1f)\n\n*Figure 17. Embedding the payload*\n\nAfter making the changes, a new archive with the xlsx extension was created. At the moment of converting the xlsx file into an HTML representation, a property is obtained that participates in the formation of a string without sanitization.\n\n![fig18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0f63bfb-d9e1-4c9d-a2a9-8a0a20406cdc)\n\n*Figure 18. Getting a custom property*\n\nWhen calling the static `generateMeta` method, you can see that the key of the custom property is displayed without sanitization.\n\n![fig19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c74e264-af68-4f62-8ac7-437e65884e86)\n\n*Figure 19. Getting a custom property*\n\nAs a result, when viewing the excel file as the HTML representation, arbitrary JavaScript code will be executed.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"356\" alt=\"fig20\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6ed21e3-685c-415c-b2dc-453bc0652bef\" /\u003e\n\n*Figure 20.
