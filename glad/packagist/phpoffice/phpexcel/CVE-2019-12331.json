  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-12331",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/phpoffice/phpexcel",
  "Title": "XXE in PHPSpreadsheet due to incomplete fix for previous encoding issue",
  "Description": "PHPOffice PhpSpreadsheet before 1.8.0 has an XXE issue. The XmlScanner decodes the sheet1.xml from an .xlsx to utf-8 if something else than UTF-8 is declared in the header. This was a security measurement to prevent CVE-2018-19277 but the fix is not sufficient. By double-encoding the the xml payload to utf-7 it is possible to bypass the check for the string ?\u003c!ENTITY? and thus allowing for an xml external entity processing (XXE) attack.",
