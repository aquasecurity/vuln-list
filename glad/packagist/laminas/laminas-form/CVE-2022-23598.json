  "PackageSlug": "packagist/laminas/laminas-form",
  "Title": "Reflected XSS vulnerability when rendering error messages in laminas-form",
  "Description": "laminas-form is a package for validating and displaying simple and complex forms. When rendering validation error messages via the `formElementErrors()` view helper shipped with laminas-form, many messages will contain the submitted value. However, in laminas-form, the value was not being escaped for HTML contexts, which could potentially lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack. contain a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. A workaround is available. One may manually place code at the top of a view script where one calls the `formElementErrors()` view helper.",
