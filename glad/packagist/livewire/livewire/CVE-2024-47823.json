  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47823",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/livewire/livewire",
  "Title": "Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads",
  "Description": "In livewire/livewire prior to `v2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension.\nIf the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack:\n\n- Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file-\u003egetClientOriginalName()`\n- Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk\n- Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files",
