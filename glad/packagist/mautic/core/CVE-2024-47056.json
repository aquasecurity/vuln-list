  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-47056",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/mautic/core",
  "Title": "Mautic does not shield .env files from web traffic",
  "Description": "This advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where sensitive `.env` configuration files may be directly accessible via a web browser. This exposure could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including database credentials, API keys, and other critical system configurations.\n\nSensitive Information Disclosure via `.env` File Exposure: The `.env` file, which typically contains environment variables and sensitive application configurations, is directly accessible via a web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such files.
