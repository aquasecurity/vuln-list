  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-24764",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/october/system",
  "Title": "October System module has an Open Redirect for Administrator Accounts",
  "Description": "This advisory affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host.\n\nThis vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user.",
