  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-51991",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/october/october",
  "Title": "October CMS Allows Unprotected SVG Rename in Media Manager",
  "Description": "This advisory affects authenticated administrators with sites that have the `media.clean_vectors` configuration enabled. This configuration will sanitize SVG files uploaded using the media manager. This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass this protection by uploading it with a permitted extension (for example, .jpg or .png) and later modifying it to the .svg extension.\n\nThis vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user.",
