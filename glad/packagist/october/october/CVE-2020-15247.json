  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15247",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/october/october",
  "Title": "Missing Authorization",
  "Description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS, an authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write \u0026 manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write \u0026 execute arbitrary PHP.",
