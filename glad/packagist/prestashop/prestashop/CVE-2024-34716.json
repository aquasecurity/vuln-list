  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-34716",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/prestashop/prestashop",
  "Title": "PrestaShop cross-site scripting via customer contact form in FO, through file upload",
  "Description": "Only PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled are impacted, starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0.\n\nThe impact is substantial, when the customer thread feature flag is enabled, through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office.\n\nConsequence: the script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right.",
