  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-25170",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/prestashop/prestashop",
  "Title": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Description": "PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application that, prior to version 8.0.1, is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). When authenticating users, PrestaShop preserves session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enable same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. The problem is fixed in version 8.0.1.",
