  "Title": "propel/propel1 SQL injection possible with limit() on MySQL",
  "Description": "The limit() query method is susceptible to catastrophic SQL injection with MySQL.\n\nFor example, given a model User for a table users:\n```\nUserQuery::create()-\u003elimit('1;DROP TABLE users')-\u003efind();\n```\nThis will drop the users table!\n\nThe cause appears to be a lack of integer casting of the limit input in either Criteria::setLimit() or in DBMySQL::applyLimit(). The code comments there seem to imply that casting was avoided due to overflow issues with 32-bit integers.\n\nThis is surprising behavior since one of the primary purposes of an ORM is to prevent basic SQL injection.\n\nThis affects all versions of Propel: 1.x, 2.x, and 3.",
