  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-46734",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/symfony/twig-bridge",
  "Title": "Symfony potential Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities in CodeExtension filters",
  "Description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 2.0.0, 5.0.0, and 6.0.0 and prior to versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, some Twig filters in CodeExtension use `is_safe=html` but don't actually ensure their input is safe. As of versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, Symfony now escapes the output of the affected filters.",
