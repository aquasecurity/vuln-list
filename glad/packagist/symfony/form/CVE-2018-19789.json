  "Identifier": "CVE-2018-19789",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/symfony/form",
  "Title": "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type",
  "Description": "When using the scalar type hint `string` in a setter method (e.g. `setName(string $name)`) of a class that's the `data_class` of a form, and when a file upload is submitted to the corresponding field instead of a normal text input, then `UploadedFile::__toString()` is called which will then return and disclose the path of the uploaded file. If combined with a local file inclusion issue in certain circumstances this could escalate it to a Remote Code Execution.",
