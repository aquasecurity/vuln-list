  "Identifier": "CVE-2017-11365",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/symfony/security",
  "Title": "Empty passwords validation issue",
  "Description": "Validating a user password with a `UserPassword` constraint but with no `NotBlank` constraint passes without any error (the empty password would not be compared with the user password). Note that you should always be explicit and add a `NotBlank` constraint, but as it worked before without, it's considered as a backward compatibility break and a security issue.",
