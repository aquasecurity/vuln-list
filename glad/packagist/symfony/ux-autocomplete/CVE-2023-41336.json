  "Title": "Prevent injection of invalid entity ids for \"autocomplete\" fields",
  "Description": "### Impact\nUnder certain circumstances, an attacker could successfully submit an entity id for an `EntityType` that is *not* part of the valid choices.\n\nAffected applications are any that use:\n\n* A custom `query_builder` option to limit the valid results;\nAND\n* An `EntityType` with `'autocomplete' =\u003e true` or a custom [AsEntityAutocompleteField](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-autocomplete/current/index.html#usage-in-a-form-with-ajax).\n\nUnder this circumstance, if an id is submitted, it is accepted even if the matching record would not be returned by the custom query built with `query_builder`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in `symfony/ux-autocomplete` version 2.11.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to version 2.11.2 or greater of `symfony/ux-autocomplete` or perform extra validation after submit to verify the selected option is valid.\n",
