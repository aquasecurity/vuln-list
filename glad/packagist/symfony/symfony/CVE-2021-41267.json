  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-41267",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/symfony/symfony",
  "Title": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')",
  "Description": "`Symfony/Http-Kernel` is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Headers that are not part of the `trusted_headers` allowed list are ignored and protect users from Cache poisoning attacks. In Symfony, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but this header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the `trusted_headers` allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue.",
