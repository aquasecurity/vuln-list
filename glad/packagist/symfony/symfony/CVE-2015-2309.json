  "Identifier": "CVE-2015-2309",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/symfony/symfony",
  "Title": "Unsafe methods in the Request class",
  "Description": "The `Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request` class provides a mechanism that ensures it does not trust HTTP header values coming from a \"non-trusted\" client. Unfortunately, it assumes that the remote address is always a trusted client if at least one trusted proxy is involved in the request; this allows a man-in-the-middle attack between the latest trusted proxy and the web server. The following methods are impacted: `getPort()`, `isSecure()`, `getHost()` and `getClientIps()`.",
