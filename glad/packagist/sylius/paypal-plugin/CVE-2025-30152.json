  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-30152",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/sylius/paypal-plugin",
  "Title": "Sylius PayPal Plugin has an Order Manipulation Vulnerability after PayPal Checkout",
  "Description": "A discovered vulnerability allows users to modify their shopping cart after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization. If a user initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns to the order summary page, they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing the order. As a result, the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount actually captured by PayPal, leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products or services without full payment.",
