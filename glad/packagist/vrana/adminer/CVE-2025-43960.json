  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-43960",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/vrana/adminer",
  "Title": "Adminer PHP Object Injection issue leads to Denial of Service",
  "Description": "Adminer 4.8.1, when using Monolog for logging, allows a Denial of Service (memory consumption) via a crafted serialized payload (e.g., using s:1000000000), leading to a PHP Object Injection issue. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger this by sending a malicious serialized object, which forces excessive memory usage, rendering Adminerâ€™s interface unresponsive and causing a server-level DoS. While the server may recover after several minutes, multiple simultaneous requests can cause a complete crash requiring manual intervention.",
