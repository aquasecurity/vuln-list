  "Title": "SimpleSAMLphp Information Disclosure vulnerability",
  "Description": "The new admin interface includes a way to view information about the host where SimpleSAMLphp is installed, by means of the phpinfo() PHP function. An endpoint that exposes the output of that function is included in the admin module for easier debugging.\n\nThe aforementioned endpoint had no checks for administrator privileges. This would allow any individual to access the given endpoint without authenticating, gathering information about the affected system.",
