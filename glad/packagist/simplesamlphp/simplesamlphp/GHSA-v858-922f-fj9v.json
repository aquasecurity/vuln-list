  "Title": "SimpleSAMLphp Link Injection vulnerability",
  "Description": "The following scripts were not checking the URLs obtained via the HTTP request before displaying them as the target of links that the user may click on:\n\n- www/logout.php\n- modules/core/www/no_cookie.php\nThe issue allowed attackers to display links targeting a malicious website inside a trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp, due to the lack of security checks involving the link_href and retryURL HTTP parameters, respectively. The issue was resolved by including a verification of the URLs received in the request against a white list of websites specified in the trusted.url.domains configuration option.",
