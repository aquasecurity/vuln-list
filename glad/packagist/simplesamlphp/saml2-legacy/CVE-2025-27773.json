  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-27773",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/simplesamlphp/saml2-legacy",
  "Title": "The SimpleSAMLphp SAML2 library incorrectly verifies signatures for HTTP-Redirect binding",
  "Description": "There's a signature confusion attack in the HTTPRedirect binding. An attacker with any signed SAMLResponse via the HTTP-Redirect binding can cause the application to accept an unsigned message.\n\nI believe that it exists for v4 only. I have not yet developed a PoC.\n\nV5 is well designed and instead builds the signed query from the same message that will be consumed.",
