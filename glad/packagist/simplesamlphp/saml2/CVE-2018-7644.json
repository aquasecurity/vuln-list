  "Title": "Improper signature validation",
  "Description": "The `XmlSecLibs` library as used in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp incorrectly verifies signatures on SAML assertions, allowing a remote attacker to construct a crafted SAML assertion on behalf of an Identity Provider that would pass as cryptographically valid, thereby allowing them to impersonate a user from that Identity Provider, aka a key confusion issue.",
