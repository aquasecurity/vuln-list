  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-28864",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/ilicmiljan/secure-props",
  "Title": "[TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match)",
  "Description": "Vulnerability in **SecureProps** involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data.\n\nThis occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.\n\nThe vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default).",
