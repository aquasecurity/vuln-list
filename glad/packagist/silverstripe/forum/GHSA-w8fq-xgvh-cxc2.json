  "Title": "Silverstripe Forum Module CSRF Vulnerability",
  "Description": "A number of form actions in the Forum module are directly accessible. A malicious user (e.g. spammer) can use GET requests to create Members and post to forums, bypassing CSRF and anti-spam measures.\n\nAdditionally, a forum moderator could be tricked into clicking a specially crafted URL, resulting in a topic being moved.\n\nThanks to Michael Strong for discovering.",
