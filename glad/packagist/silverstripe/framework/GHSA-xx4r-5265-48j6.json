  "Description": "When performing a fulltext search in SilverStripe 4.0.0 the 'start' querystring parameter is never escaped safely. This exposes a possible SQL injection vulnerability.\n\nThe issue exists in 3.5 and 3.6 but is less vulnerable, as SearchForm sanitises these variables prior to passing to mysql.",
