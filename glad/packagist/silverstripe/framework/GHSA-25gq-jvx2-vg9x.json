  "Title": "Silverstripe X-Forwarded-Host request hostname injection",
  "Description": "A potential hostname injection vulnerability has been found which could allow attackers to alter url resolution.\n\nIf a request contains the X-Forwarded-Host HTTP header a website would then use its value in place of the actual HTTP hostname. In cases where caching is enabled, this could allow an attacker to potentially embed a remote url as the base_url for any site. This would then cause other visitors to the site to be redirected unknowingly.\n\nThis header is necessary for servers running behind a reverse proxy (such as nginx). Such servers are likely not vulnerable to this risk.\n\nA fix has been merged into the default installer, although existing projects which do not run behind a reverse proxy should update their htaccess as below:\n```\n\u003cIfModule mod_headers.c\u003e",
