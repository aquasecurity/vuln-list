  "Title": "silverstripe/framework Privilege Escalation Risk in Member Edit form",
  "Description": "A member with the permission `EDIT_PERMISSIONS` and access to the \"Security\" section is able to re-assign themselves (or another member) to `ADMIN` level.\n\nCMS Fields for the member are constructed using DirectGroups instead of Groups relation which results in bypassing security logic preventing privilege escalation.",
