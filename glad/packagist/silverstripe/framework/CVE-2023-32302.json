  "Identifier": "CVE-2023-32302",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/silverstripe/framework",
  "Title": "Improper Input Validation",
  "Description": "Silverstripe Framework is the MVC framework that powers Silverstripe CMS. When a new member record is created and a password is not set, an empty encrypted password is generated. As a result, if someone is aware of the existence of a member record associated with a specific email address, they can potentially attempt to log in using that empty password. Although the default member authenticator and login form require a non-empty password, alternative authentication methods might still permit a successful login with the empty password. This issue has been patched in versions 4.13.4 and 5.0.13.\n\n\n",
