  "Title": "silverstripe/framework member disclosure in login form",
  "Description": "There is a user ID enumeration vulnerability in our brute force error messages.\n\n- Users that don't exist in will never get a locked out message\n- Users that do exist, will get a locked out message\n\nThis means an attacker can infer or confirm user details that exist in the member table.\n\nThis issue has been resolved by ensuring that login attempt logging and lockout process works equivalently for non-existent users as it does for existant users.",
