  "Title": "Silverstripe External redirection risk in Security?ReturnURL",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been found in the SilverStripe framework where a login url can be potentially redirected to an external site.\n\nFor example, the url http://www.my-silverstripe-site.com/Security/login?BackURL=/\\attacker-site.com will redirect successful logins to the page http://attacker-site.com. If that website were set up to look identical to the first with \"login failed\" then the user will likely just enter their user/pass again.",
