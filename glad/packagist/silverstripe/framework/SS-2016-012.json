  "Description": "The `SS_Report`, and the reports CMS section only checks `canView()` when listing the reports that can be viewed by the current user. It does not (and should) perform `canView` checks when the report is actually viewed, so if you know the URL to a report and can otherwise access the Reports section of the CMS, you can view any report.",
