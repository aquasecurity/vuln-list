  "Title": "Advanced workflow member field exposure",
  "Description": "By default, the CMS Admin editable template for the NotifyUsers action has access to a large number of fields, including (for instance) `Member#Password`. This would allow a malicious CMS Admin to extract other admin passwords by adding a template emailing these fields to themselves when other admins trigger the workflow. A new configuration option has been added; when this option is set to `true` via the Config API then only member fields specified via `Member.summary_fields` may be accessed.",
