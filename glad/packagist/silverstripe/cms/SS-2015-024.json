  "Title": "Queued jobs serialised data exposure",
  "Description": "SavedJobData and SavedJobMessages contain php serialized data. There's no point showing these to a CMS Admin as they're not human readable. Worse, it might be insecure, as a malicious CMS Admin might be able to craft a payload thats dangerous to unserialize. This issue has been resolved by hiding this content, even from administrators.",
