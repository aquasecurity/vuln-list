  "PackageSlug": "packagist/pocketmine/pocketmine-mp",
  "Title": "PocketMine-MP vulnerable to improperly checked dropped item count leading to server crash",
  "Description": "In 4.18.0, the network handling of inventories was completely revamped. Due to this, a bug was introduced which allowed players to request that the server drop more of an item than they had available in their hotbar.\n\nThis did not lead to any duplication issues, but instead led to a server crash, and is believed to have been exploited in the wild.",
