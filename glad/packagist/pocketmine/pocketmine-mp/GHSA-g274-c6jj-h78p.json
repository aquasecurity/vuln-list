  "Title": "PocketMine-MP allows malicious client data to waste server resources due to lack of limits for explode()",
  "Description": "Due to lack of limits by default in the [`explode()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php) function, malicious clients were able to abuse some packets to waste server CPU and memory.\n\nThis is similar to a previous security issue published in https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/security/advisories/GHSA-gj94-v4p9-w672, but with a wider impact, including but not limited to:\n\n- Sign editing\n- LoginPacket JWT parsing\n- Command parsing\n\nHowever, the estimated impact of these issues is low, due to other limits such as the packet decompression limit.",
