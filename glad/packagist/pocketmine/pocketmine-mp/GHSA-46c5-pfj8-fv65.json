  "Title": "Improperly checked metadata on tools/armour itemstacks received from the client",
  "Description": "Due to a workaround applied in 1.13, an attacker may send a negative damage/meta value in a tool or armour item's NBT, which `TypeConverter` then blindly uses as if it was valid without being checked.\n\nWhen this invalid metadata value reaches `Durable-\u003esetDamage()`, an exception is thrown because the metadata is not within the expected range for damage values.",
