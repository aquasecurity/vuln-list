  "Title": "Unchecked validity of Facing values in PlayerActionPacket",
  "Description": "### Impact\nA remote attacker may crash a server by sending `PlayerActionPacket` with invalid facing values (e.g. negative), specifically with `START_BREAK` or `CRACK_BLOCK` actions, or with a `UseItemTransactionData` (typically in `InventoryTransactionPacket`).\n\n### Patches\nf126479c37ff00a717a828f5271cf8e821d12d6c\n\n### Workarounds\nUsing a plugin, cancel `DataPacketReceiveEvent` if the packet is `PlayerActionPacket` and the facing is outside the range 0-5 when receiving START_BREAK or CRACK_BLOCK actions, or UseItemTransactionData. However, beware that negative values may be legitimate in some cases.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n",
