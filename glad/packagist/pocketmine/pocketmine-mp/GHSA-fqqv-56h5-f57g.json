  "Title": "PocketMine-MP `ResourcePackDataInfoPacket` amplification vulnerability due to lack of resource pack sequence status checking",
  "Description": "A denial-of-service / out-of-memory vulnerability exists in the `STATUS_SEND_PACKS` handling of `ResourcePackClientResponsePacket`.\nPocketMine-MP processes the `packIds` array without verifying that all entries are unique.\nA malicious (non-standard) Bedrock client can send multiple duplicate valid pack UUIDs in the same `STATUS_SEND_PACKS` packet, causing the server to send the same pack multiple times. This can quickly exhaust memory and crash the server.\nSeverity: **High** â€” Remote DoS from an authenticated client.\n\n---",
