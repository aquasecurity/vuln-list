  "Identifier": "CVE-2025-46346",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/yeswiki/yeswiki",
  "Title": "YesWiki Stored XSS Vulnerability in Comments ",
  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the applicationâ€™s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment.\n\nThe XSS occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `\u003cscript\u003e` tags, but does not account for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`.",
