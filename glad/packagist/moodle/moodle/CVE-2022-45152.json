  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-45152",
  "PackageSlug": "packagist/moodle/moodle",
  "Title": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
  "Description": "A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was found in Moodle. This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks.",
