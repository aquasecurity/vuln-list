  "details": "The Prometheus client_golang HTTP server is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods.\n\nIn order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of the promhttp.InstrumentHandler* middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass a metric with a \"method\" label name to a middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown \"method\".",
