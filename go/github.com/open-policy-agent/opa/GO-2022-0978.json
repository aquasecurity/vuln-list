  "details": "Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe and rejected by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage.\n\nA bypass of this protection is possible when using the `with` keyword to mock a built-in function that isn't taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`.",
