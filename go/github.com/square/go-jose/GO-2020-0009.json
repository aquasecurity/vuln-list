  "details": "On 32-bit platforms an attacker can manipulate a ciphertext encrypted with AES-CBC with HMAC such that they can control how large the input buffer is when computing the HMAC authentication tag. This can can allow a manipulated ciphertext to be verified as authentic, opening the door for padding oracle attacks.",
