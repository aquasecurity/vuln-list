  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-16092:\n\tAn assertion failure flaw was found in QEMU in the network packet processing component. This issue affects the \"e1000e\" and \"vmxnet3\" network devices. This flaw allows a malicious guest user or process to abort the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.\n1860283: CVE-2020-16092 QEMU: reachable assertion failure in net_tx_pkt_add_raw_fragment() in hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c\n\nCVE-2020-13765:\n\tAn out-of-bound write access flaw was found in the way QEMU loads ROM contents at boot time. This flaw occurs in the rom_copy() routine while loading the contents of a 32-bit -kernel image into memory. Running an untrusted -kernel image may load contents at arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.\n1842912: CVE-2020-13765 QEMU: loader: OOB access while loading registered ROM may lead to code execution\n",
