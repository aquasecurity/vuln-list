  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-3289:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 9.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).\n1413562: \nCVE-2017-3289 OpenJDK: insecure class construction (Hotspot, 8167104)\n\nCVE-2017-3272:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded.

CVSS v3.0 Base Score 9.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).\n1413554: \nCVE-2017-3272 OpenJDK: insufficient protected field access checks in atomic field updaters (Libraries, 8165344)\n\nCVE-2017-3261:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Confidentiality impacts).\n1413653: \nCVE-2017-3261 OpenJDK: integer overflow in SocketOutputStream boundary check (Networking, 8164147)\n\nCVE-2017-3253:\n\tIt was discovered that the 2D component of OpenJDK performed parsing of iTXt and zTXt PNG image chunks even when configured to ignore metadata. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted PNG image could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory.\n1413583: \nCVE-2017-3253 OpenJDK: imageio PNGImageReader failed to honor ignoreMetadata for iTXt and zTXt chunks (2D, 8166988)\n\nCVE-2017-3252:\n\tIt was discovered that the JAAS component of OpenJDK did not use the correct way to extract user DN from the result of the user search LDAP query. A specially crafted user LDAP entry could cause the application to use an incorrect DN.\n1413906: \nCVE-2017-3252 OpenJDK: LdapLoginModule incorrect userDN extraction (JAAS, 8161743)\n\nCVE-2017-3241:\n\tIt was discovered that the RMI registry and DCG implementations in the RMI component of OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application.\n1413955: \nCVE-2017-3241 OpenJDK: untrusted input deserialization in RMI registry and DCG (RMI, 8156802)\n\nCVE-2017-3231:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111.

A remote attacker could cause a Java application to incorrectly parse an attacker supplied URL and interpret it differently from other applications processing the same URL.\n1413882: \nCVE-2016-5552 OpenJDK: incorrect URL parsing in URLStreamHandler (Networking, 8167223)\n\nCVE-2016-5548:\n\tA covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel.\n1413920: \nCVE-2016-5548 OpenJDK: DSA implementation timing attack (Libraries, 8168728)\n\nCVE-2016-5547:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not validate the length of the object identifier read from the DER input before allocating memory to store the OID. An attacker able to make a Java application decode a specially crafted DER input could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory.\n1413764: \nCVE-2016-5547 OpenJDK: missing ObjectIdentifier length check (Libraries, 8168705)\n\nCVE-2016-5546:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK accepted ECSDA signatures using non-canonical DER encoding. This could cause a Java application to accept signature in an incorrect format not accepted by other cryptographic tools.\nIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK accepted ECDSA signatures using non-canonical DER encoding. This could cause a Java application to accept signature in an incorrect format not accepted by other cryptographic tools.\n1413911: \nCVE-2016-5546 OpenJDK: incorrect ECDSA signature extraction from the DER input (Libraries, 8168714)\n",
