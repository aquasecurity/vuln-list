  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-1420:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Vim. The issue occurs when using a number in a string for the lambda name, triggering an out-of-range pointer offset vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted script containing an argument as a number and then using it as a string pointer to access any memory location, causing an application to crash and possibly access some memory.\n\nCVE-2022-1381:\n\tA global heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in vim's skip_range() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. This flaw occurs because vim uses an invalid pointer with V: in Ex mode. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1160:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's get_one_sourceline() function of scriptfile.c file. This flaw occurs when source can read past the end of the copied line. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1154:\n\tA heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's utf_ptr2char() function of the src/mbyte.c file. This flaw occurs because vim is using a buffer line after it has been freed in the old regexp engine. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-0943:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's suggest_try_change() function of the spellsuggest.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0572:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's ex_retab() function of indent.c file. This flaw occurs when repeatedly using :retab. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file triggering a heap-overflow.\n\nCVE-2022-0413:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to using freed memory when the substitute uses a recursive function call, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0392:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.\n\nCVE-2022-0361:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.\n\nCVE-2022-0359:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access with large tabstop in Ex mode, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0318:\n\tA flaw was found in vim.  The vulnerability occurs due to reading beyond the end of a line in the utf_head_off function, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0261:\n\tA heap based out-of-bounds write flaw was found in vim's ops.c. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user to open a crafted file triggering an out-of-bounds write. This vulnerability is capable of crashing software, modify memory, and possible code execution.\n",
