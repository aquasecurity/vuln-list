  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-3867:\n\tlib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not properly restrict the characters in the Common Name field of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to trick administrators into signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI control sequences.\n839158: \nCVE-2012-3867 puppet: insufficient validation of agent names in CN of SSL certificate requests\n\nCVE-2012-3866:\n\tlib/puppet/defaults.rb in Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, uses 0644 permissions for last_run_report.yaml, which allows local users to obtain sensitive configuration information by leveraging access to the puppet master server to read this file.\n839135: \nCVE-2012-3866 puppet: information leak via world readable last_run_report.yaml\n\nCVE-2012-3865:\n\tDirectory traversal vulnerability in lib/puppet/reports/store.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, when Delete is enabled in auth.conf, allows remote authenticated users to delete arbitrary files on the puppet master server via a .. (dot dot) in a node name.\n839131: \nCVE-2012-3865 puppet: authenticated clients allowed to delete arbitrary files on the puppet master\n\nCVE-2012-3864:\n\tPuppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files on the puppet master server by leveraging an arbitrary user's certificate and private key in a GET request.\n839130: \nCVE-2012-3864 puppet: authenticated clients allowed to read arbitrary files from the puppet master\n",
