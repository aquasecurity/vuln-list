  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-15695:\n\tTigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to stack buffer overflow, which could be triggered from CMsgReader::readSetCursor. This vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of PixelFormat. Since remote attacker can choose offset from start of the buffer to start writing his values, exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.\n1790318: CVE-2019-15695 tigervnc: Stack buffer overflow in CMsgReader::readSetCursor\n\nCVE-2019-15694:\n\tTigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflow, which could be triggered from DecodeManager::decodeRect. Vulnerability occurs due to the signdness error in processing MemOutStream. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.\n1790315: CVE-2019-15694 tigervnc: Heap buffer overflow in DecodeManager::decodeRect\n\nCVE-2019-15693:\n\tTigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflow, which occurs in TightDecoder::FilterGradient. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.\n1790313: CVE-2019-15693 tigervnc: Heap buffer overflow in TightDecoder::FilterGradient\n\nCVE-2019-15692:\n\tTigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflow. Vulnerability could be triggered from CopyRectDecoder due to incorrect value checks. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.\n1789527: CVE-2019-15692 tigervnc: Heap buffer overflow triggered from CopyRectDecoder due to incorrect value checks\n\nCVE-2019-15691:\n\tTigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to stack use-after-return, which occurs due to incorrect usage of stack memory in ZRLEDecoder. If decoding routine would throw an exception, ZRLEDecoder may try to access stack variable, which has been already freed during the process of stack unwinding. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.\n1789908: CVE-2019-15691 tigervnc: Stack use-after-return due to incorrect usage of stack memory in ZRLEDecoder\n",
