  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-2830:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Concurrency). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6 and 14; Java SE Embedded: 8u241. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n\nCVE-2020-2805:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the readObject() method of the MethodType class in the Libraries component of OpenJDK checked argument types. This flaw allows an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2020-2803:\n\tA flaw was found in the boundary checks in the java.nio buffer classes in the Libraries component of OpenJDK, where it is bypassed in certain cases. This flaw allows an untrusted Java application or applet o bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2020-2800:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Lightweight HTTP Server). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6 and 14; Java SE Embedded: 8u241. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.8 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts).
