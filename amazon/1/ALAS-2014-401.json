  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-3386:\n\tThe \"make distcheck\" rule in GNU Automake before 1.11.6 and 1.12.x before 1.12.2 grants world-writable permissions to the extraction directory, which introduces a race condition that allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\nIt was found that the distcheck rule in Automake-generated Makefiles made a directory world-writable when preparing source archives. If a malicious, local user could access this directory, they could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running \"make distcheck\".\n838286: \nCVE-2012-3386 automake: locally exploitable \"make distcheck\" bug\n",
