  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-2841:\n\tMultiple flaws were found in the way libexif processed Exif tags. An attacker could create a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an application linked against libexif, could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\nInteger underflow in the exif_entry_get_value function in exif-entry.c in the EXIF Tag Parsing Library (aka libexif) 0.6.20 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a crafted buffer-size parameter during the formatting of an EXIF tag, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n839189: \nCVE-2012-2841 libexif: \"exif_entry_get_value()\" integer underflow\n\nCVE-2012-2840:\n\tOff-by-one error in the exif_convert_utf16_to_utf8 function in exif-entry.c in the EXIF Tag Parsing Library (aka libexif) before 0.6.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted EXIF tags in an image.\nMultiple flaws were found in the way libexif processed Exif tags.
