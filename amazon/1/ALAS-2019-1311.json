  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-9517:\n\tSome HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-9517 HTTP/2: request for large response leads to denial of service\n\nCVE-2019-10098:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in Apache httpd, in mod_rewrite. Certain self-referential mod_rewrite rules could be fooled by encoded newlines, causing them to redirect to an unexpected location. An attacker could abuse this flaw in a phishing attack or as part of a client-side attack on browsers.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-10098 httpd: mod_rewrite potential open redirect\n\nCVE-2019-10097:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in Apache httpd, in mod_remoteip. A trusted proxy using the \u0026quot;PROXY\u0026quot; protocol could send specially crafted headers that can cause httpd to experience a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash or other potential consequences.\\n\\nThis issue could only be exploited by configured trusted intermediate proxy servers. HTTP clients such as browsers could not exploit the vulnerability.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-10097 httpd: null-pointer dereference in mod_remoteip\n\nCVE-2019-10092:\n\tA cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in Apache httpd, affecting the mod_proxy error page. Under certain circumstances, a crafted link could inject content into the HTML displayed in the error page, potentially leading to client-side exploitation.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-10092 httpd: limited cross-site scripting in mod_proxy error page\n\nCVE-2019-10082:\n\tA read-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Apache httpd, in mod_http2. A specially crafted http/2 client session could cause the server to read memory that was previously freed during connection shutdown, potentially leading to a crash.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-10082 httpd: read-after-free in h2 connection shutdown\n\nCVE-2019-10081:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Apache httpd, in mod_http2. Under certain circumstances, HTTP/2 early pushes could lead to memory corruption, causing a server to crash.\n99999: \nCVE-2019-10081 httpd: memory corruption on early pushes\n",
