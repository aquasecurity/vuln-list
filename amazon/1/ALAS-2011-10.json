  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-3560:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier, and 1.4.2_33 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality and integrity, related to JSSE.\nIt was found that HttpsURLConnection did not perform SecurityManager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory method. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass connection restrictions defined in the policy.\n\nCVE-2011-3558:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to HotSpot.\nA flaw was found in the Java HotSpot virtual machine. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of the VM memory, or cause it to crash.\n\nCVE-2011-3557:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier, 1.4.2_33 and earlier, and JRockit R28.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, related to RMI.\nA flaw was found in the Java RMI registry implementation. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute code on the RMI server with unrestricted privileges.\n\nCVE-2011-3556:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier, 1.4.2_33 and earlier, and JRockit R28.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, related to RMI.\nA flaw was found in the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) registry implementation. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the RMI server running the registry.\n\nCVE-2011-3554:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.\nAn insufficient error checking flaw was found in the unpacker for JAR files in pack200 format. A specially-crafted JAR file could use this flaw to crash the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with JVM privileges.\n\nCVE-2011-3553:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, and JRockit R28.1.4 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality, related to JAXWS.\nThe Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) implementation in OpenJDK was configured to include the stack trace in error messages sent to clients. A remote client could possibly use this flaw to obtain sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2011-3552:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier, and 1.4.2_33 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect integrity via unknown vectors related to Networking.\nIt was found that Java applications running with SecurityManager restrictions were allowed to use too many UDP sockets by default. If multiple instances of a malicious application were started at the same time, they could exhaust all available UDP sockets on the system.\n\nCVE-2011-3551:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, and JRockit R28.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D.\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the Java2D code used to perform transformations of graphic shapes and images. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2011-3548:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier, and 1.4.2_33 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, related to AWT.\nA flaw was found in the AWTKeyStroke implementation. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2011-3547:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, 5.0 Update 31 and earlier, and 1.4.2_33 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to Networking.\nAn information leak flaw was found in the InputStream.skip implementation. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to obtain bytes skipped by other threads.\n\nCVE-2011-3544:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE 7 and 6 Update 27 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Scripting.\nIt was found that the Java ScriptingEngine did not properly restrict the privileges of sandboxed applications. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2011-3521:\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment component in Oracle Java SE JDK and JRE, 7, 6 Update 27 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 31 earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Deserialization.\nA flaw was found in the IIOP (Internet Inter-Orb Protocol) deserialization code. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions by deserializing specially-crafted input.\n\nCVE-2011-3389:\n\tThis update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 6 Runtime Environment and the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit. Further information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch page, listed in the References section.\nThis update fixes several vulnerabilities in the IBM Java 6 Runtime Environment and the IBM Java 6 Software Development Kit. Detailed vulnerability descriptions are linked from the IBM \"Security alerts\" page, listed in the References section.\nThis update fixes several vulnerabilities in the IBM Java 2 Runtime Environment and the IBM Java 2 Software Development Kit. Detailed vulnerability descriptions are linked from the IBM \"Security alerts\" page, listed in the References section.\nThis update fixes several vulnerabilities in the IBM Java 1.4.2 Runtime Environment and the IBM Java 1.4.2 Software Development Kit. Detailed vulnerability descriptions are linked from the IBM \"Security alerts\" page, listed in the References section.\nThe SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a \"BEAST\" attack.\nA flaw was found in the way the SSL 3 and TLS 1.0 protocols used block ciphers in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. An attacker able to perform a chosen plain text attack against a connection mixing trusted and untrusted data could use this flaw to recover portions of the trusted data sent over the connection.\n",
