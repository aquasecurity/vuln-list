An attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands.\n1291227: \nCVE-2015-8560 cups-filters: foomatic-rip did not consider semicolon as illegal shell escape character\n\nCVE-2010-5325:\n\tIt was discovered that the unhtmlify() function of foomatic-rip did not correctly calculate buffer sizes, possibly leading to a heap-based memory corruption. A malicious attacker could exploit this flaw to cause foomatic-rip to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n1218297: \nCVE-2010-5325 foomatic: potential remote arbitrary code execution\n",
