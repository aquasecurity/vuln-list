  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-43750:\n\tdrivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory.\n\nCVE-2022-41850:\n\troccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a report-\u003evalue is in progress.\n\nCVE-2022-41849:\n\tdrivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect.\n\nCVE-2022-40768:\n\tdrivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case.\n\nCVE-2022-39842:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur.\n\nCVE-2022-3649:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992.\n\nCVE-2022-3646:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3621:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component nilfs2. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211920.\n\nCVE-2022-3594:\n\tA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function intr_callback of the file drivers/net/usb/r8152.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to logging of excessive data. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211363.\n\nCVE-2022-3565:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211088.\n\nCVE-2022-3564:\n\tA vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this vulnerability is the function l2cap_reassemble_sdu of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211087.\n\nCVE-2022-3542:\n\tA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Linux Kernel. This vulnerability affects the function bnx2x_tpa_stop of the file drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_cmn.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211042 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-2978:\n\tA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel NILFS file system was found in the way user triggers function security_inode_alloc to fail with following call to function nilfs_mdt_destroy. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-26373:\n\tA flaw was found in hw. In certain processors with Intel's Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities, soon after VM exit or IBPB command event, the linear address following the most recent near CALL instruction prior to a VM exit may be used as the Return Stack Buffer (RSB) prediction.\n\nCVE-2022-20369:\n\tIn v4l2_m2m_querybuf of v4l2-mem2mem.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper input validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-223375145References: Upstream kernel\n",
