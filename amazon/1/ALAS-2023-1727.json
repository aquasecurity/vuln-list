  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-27536:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the GSS delegation (CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION) option had been changed that could have changed the user's permissions in a second transfer.\n\nlibcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, this GSS delegation setting was left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily, affecting krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.\n\nCVE-2023-27535:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created FTP connection even when one or more options had been changed that could have made the effective user a very different one, thus leading to the doing the second transfer with wrong credentials.\n\nCVE-2023-27533:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\ncurl supports communicating using the TELNET protocol and as a part of this it offers users to pass on user name and \"telnet options\" for the server negotiation.\n\nDue to lack of proper input scrubbing and without it being the documented functionality, curl would pass on user name and telnet options to the server as provided. This could allow users to pass in carefully crafted content that pass on content or do option negotiation without the application intending to do so. In particular if an application for example allows users to provide the data or parts of the data.\n",
