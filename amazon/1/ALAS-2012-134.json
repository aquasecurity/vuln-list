  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-2807:\n\tMultiple integer overflows in libxml2, as used in Google Chrome before 20.0.1132.43, on 64-bit Linux platforms allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in the way libxml2 handled documents that enable entity expansion. A remote attacker could provide a large, specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n835863: \nCVE-2012-2807 libxml2 (64-bit): Multiple integer overflows, leading to DoS or possibly other unspecified impact\n\nCVE-2011-3102:\n\tOff-by-one error in libxml2, as used in Google Chrome before 19.0.1084.46, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.\nA one byte buffer overflow was found in the way libxml2 evaluated certain parts of XML Pointer Language (XPointer) expressions. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n822109: \nCVE-2011-3102 libxml: An off-by-one out-of-bounds write by XPointer part evaluation\n",
