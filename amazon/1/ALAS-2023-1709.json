  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-43818:\n\tThere's a flaw in python-lxml's HTML Cleaner component, which is responsible for sanitizing HTML and Javascript. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted payload to a web service using python-lxml's HTML Cleaner may be able to trigger script execution in clients such as web browsers. This can occur because the HTML Cleaner did not remove scripts within SVG images in data URLs such as \u003cimg src=\u003e. XSS can result in impacts to the integrity and availability of the web page, as well as a potential impact to data confidentiality in some circumstances.\n\nCVE-2020-27783:\n\tA Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the python-lxml's clean module. The module's parser did not properly imitate browsers, causing different behaviors between the sanitizer and the user's page. This flaw allows a remote attacker to run arbitrary HTML/JS code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n",
