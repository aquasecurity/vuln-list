  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-3289:\n\t1413562: \nCVE-2017-3289 OpenJDK: insecure class construction (Hotspot, 8167104)\n\nCVE-2017-3272:\n\t1413554: \nCVE-2017-3272 OpenJDK: insufficient protected field access checks in atomic field updaters (Libraries, 8165344)\n\nCVE-2017-3261:\n\t1413653: \nCVE-2017-3261 OpenJDK: integer overflow in SocketOutputStream boundary check (Networking, 8164147)\n\nCVE-2017-3253:\n\tIt was discovered that the 2D component of OpenJDK performed parsing of iTXt and zTXt PNG image chunks even when configured to ignore metadata. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted PNG image could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory.\n1413583: \nCVE-2017-3253 OpenJDK: imageio PNGImageReader failed to honor ignoreMetadata for iTXt and zTXt chunks (2D, 8166988)\n\nCVE-2017-3252:\n\tIt was discovered that the JAAS component of OpenJDK did not use the correct way to extract user DN from the result of the user search LDAP query. A specially crafted user LDAP entry could cause the application to use an incorrect DN.\n1413906: \nCVE-2017-3252 OpenJDK: LdapLoginModule incorrect userDN extraction (JAAS, 8161743)\n\nCVE-2017-3241:\n\tIt was discovered that the RMI registry and DCG implementations in the RMI component of OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application.\n1413955: \nCVE-2017-3241 OpenJDK: untrusted input deserialization in RMI registry and DCG (RMI, 8156802)\n\nCVE-2017-3231:\n\t1413717: \nCVE-2017-3231 OpenJDK: URLClassLoader insufficient access control checks (Networking, 8151934)\n\nCVE-2016-5552:\n\tIt was discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to properly parse user info from the URL. A remote attacker could cause a Java application to incorrectly parse an attacker supplied URL and interpret it differently from other applications processing the same URL.\n1413882: \nCVE-2016-5552 OpenJDK: incorrect URL parsing in URLStreamHandler (Networking, 8167223)\n\nCVE-2016-5548:\n\tA covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel.\n1413920: \nCVE-2016-5548 OpenJDK: DSA implementation timing attack (Libraries, 8168728)\n\nCVE-2016-5547:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not validate the length of the object identifier read from the DER input before allocating memory to store the OID. An attacker able to make a Java application decode a specially crafted DER input could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory.\n1413764: \nCVE-2016-5547 OpenJDK: missing ObjectIdentifier length check (Libraries, 8168705)\n\nCVE-2016-5546:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK accepted ECSDA signatures using non-canonical DER encoding. This could cause a Java application to accept signature in an incorrect format not accepted by other cryptographic tools.\n1413911: \nCVE-2016-5546 OpenJDK: incorrect ECDSA signature extraction from the DER input (Libraries, 8168714)\n\nCVE-2016-2183:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite.\nA flaw was found in the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite.\n1369383: \nCVE-2016-2183 SSL/TLS: Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers (SWEET32)\n",
