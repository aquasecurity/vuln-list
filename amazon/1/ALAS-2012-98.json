  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-1150:\n\tPython before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.3 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative arrays (dictionaries) in Python. An attacker able to supply a large number of inputs to a Python application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization has been added to the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker successfully causing intentional collisions.\n750555: \nCVE-2012-1150 python: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)\n\nCVE-2012-0845:\n\tSimpleXMLRPCServer.py in SimpleXMLRPCServer in Python before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via an XML-RPC POST request that contains a smaller amount of data than specified by the Content-Length header.\nA flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleXMLRPCServer module handled clients disconnecting prematurely. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause excessive CPU consumption on a server using SimpleXMLRPCServer.\n789790: \nCVE-2012-0845 python: SimpleXMLRPCServer CPU usage DoS via malformed XML-RPC request\n\nCVE-2011-4944:\n\tPython 2.6 through 3.2 creates ~/.pypirc with world-readable permissions before changing them after data has been written, which introduces a race condition that allows local users to obtain a username and password by reading this file.\nA race condition was found in the way the Python distutils module set file permissions during the creation of the .pypirc file. If a local user had access to the home directory of another user who is running distutils, they could use this flaw to gain access to that user's .pypirc file, which can contain usernames and passwords for code repositories.\n758905: \nCVE-2011-4944 python: distutils creates ~/.pypirc insecurely\n\nCVE-2011-4940:\n\tThe list_directory function in Lib/SimpleHTTPServer.py in SimpleHTTPServer in Python before 2.5.6c1, 2.6.x before 2.6.7 rc2, and 2.7.x before 2.7.2 does not place a charset parameter in the Content-Type HTTP header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7 via UTF-7 encoding.\nA flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleHTTPServer module generated directory listings. An attacker able to upload a file with a specially-crafted name to a server could possibly perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims visiting a listing page generated by SimpleHTTPServer, for a directory containing the crafted file (if the victims were using certain web browsers).\n803500: \nCVE-2011-4940 python: potential XSS in SimpleHTTPServer's list_directory()\n",
