  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-32914:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_multipart_new_from_message() function is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. This flaw allows a malicious HTTP client to induce the libsoup server to read out of bounds.\n\nCVE-2025-32913:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() function is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows a malicious HTTP peer to crash a libsoup client or server that uses this function.\n\nCVE-2025-32911:\n\tlibsoup: Double free on  soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() through  \"soup-message-headers.c\" via \"params\" GHashTable value\n\nCVE-2025-32907:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The implementation of HTTP range requests is vulnerable to a resource consumption attack. This flaw allows a malicious client to request the same range many times in a single HTTP request, causing the server to use large amounts of memory.\n\nCVE-2025-32906:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_headers_parse_request() function may be vulnerable to an out-of-bound read. This flaw allows a malicious user to use a specially crafted HTTP request to crash the HTTP server.\n",
