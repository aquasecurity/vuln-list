  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-25180:\n\tThe upstream bug report describes this issue as follows:\n\nA vulnerability was found in GLib2.0, where DoS caused by handling a malicious text-form variant which is structured to cause looping superlinear to its text size. Applications are at risk if they parse untrusted text-form variants.\n\nCVE-2023-24593:\n\tThe upstream bug report describes this issue as follows:\n\nA vulnerability was found in GLib2.0, where DoS caused by handling a malicious text-form variant which is structured to cause looping superlinear to its text size. Applications are at risk if they parse untrusted text-form variants.\n\nCVE-2021-3800:\n\tA flaw was found in glib before version 2.63.6. Due to random charset alias, pkexec can leak content from files owned by privileged users to unprivileged ones under the right condition.\n\nCVE-2021-28153:\n\tAn issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)\n\nCVE-2019-13012:\n\tThe keyfile settings backend in GNOME GLib (aka glib2.0) before 2.60.0 creates directories using g_file_make_directory_with_parents (kfsb-\u003edir, NULL, NULL) and files using g_file_replace_contents (kfsb-\u003efile, contents, length, NULL, FALSE, G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION, NULL, NULL, NULL). Consequently, it does not properly restrict directory (and file) permissions. Instead, for directories, 0777 permissions are used; for files, default file permissions are used. This is similar to CVE-2019-12450.\n\nCVE-2018-16429:\n\tGNOME GLib 2.56.1 has an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in g_markup_parse_context_parse() in gmarkup.c, related to utf8_str().\n\nCVE-2018-16428:\n\tIn GNOME GLib 2.56.1, g_markup_parse_context_end_parse() in gmarkup.c has a NULL pointer dereference.\n",
