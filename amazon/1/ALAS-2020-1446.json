  "severity": "important",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-25211:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A local attacker, able to inject conntrack netlink configuration, could overflow a local buffer causing crashes or triggering the use of incorrect protocol numbers in ctnetlink_parse_tuple_filter in net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_netlink.c. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-24490:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation processed extended advertising report events. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or to potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted Bluetooth packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-14386:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-12352:\n\tAn information leak flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP (Alternate MAC-PHY Manager Protocol) packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-12351:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) packets with A2MP (Alternate MAC-PHY Manager Protocol) CID (Channel Identifier). This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or potentially executing arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-0423:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the binder_release_work of binder.c due to improper locking. This flaw can lead to the local escalation of privileges in the kernel where no additional execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n",
