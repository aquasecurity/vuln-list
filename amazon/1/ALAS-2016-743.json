  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2016-7166:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted gzip file can cause libarchive to allocate memory without limit, eventually leading to a crash.\n1347086: \nCVE-2016-7166 libarchive: Denial of service using a crafted gzip file\n\nCVE-2016-6250:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. An attempt to create an ISO9660 volume with 2GB or 4GB filenames could cause the application to crash.\n1347085: \nCVE-2016-6250 libarchive: Buffer overflow when writing large iso9660 containers\n\nCVE-2016-5844:\n\tUndefined behavior (signed integer overflow) was discovered in libarchive, in the ISO parser.  A crafted file could potentially cause denial of service.\n1350280: \nCVE-2016-5844 libarchive: undefined behaviour (integer overflow) in iso parser\n\nCVE-2016-5418:\n\tA flaw was found in the way libarchive handled hardlink archive entries of non-zero size. Combined with flaws in libarchive\u0026#039;s file system sandboxing, this issue could cause an application using libarchive to overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary data from the archive.\n1362601: \nCVE-2016-5418 libarchive: Archive Entry with type 1 (hardlink), but has a non-zero data size file overwrite\n\nCVE-2016-4809:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted cpio archive containing a symbolic link to a ridiculously large target path can cause memory allocation to fail, resulting in any attempt to view or extract the archive crashing.\n1347084: \nCVE-2016-4809 libarchive: Memory allocate error with symbolic links in cpio archives\n\nCVE-2016-4302:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive\u0026#039;s handling of RAR archives. A specially crafted RAR file can cause a heap overflow, potentially leading to code execution in the context of the application.\n1348444: \nCVE-2016-4302 libarchive: Heap buffer overflow in the Rar decompression functionality\n\nCVE-2016-4300:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive\u0026#039;s handling of 7zip data.  A specially crafted 7zip file can cause a integer overflow resulting in memory corruption that can lead to code execution.\n1348439: \nCVE-2016-4300 libarchive: Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the 7zip read_SubStreamsInfo\n\nCVE-2016-1541:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted zip file can provide an incorrect compressed size, which may allow an attacker to place arbitrary code on the heap and execute it in the context of the application.\n1334211: \nCVE-2016-1541 libarchive: zip_read_mac_metadata() heap-based buffer overflow\n\nCVE-2015-8934:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted RAR file could cause the application to read memory beyond the end of the decompression buffer.\n1349229: \nCVE-2015-8934 libarchive: out of bounds heap read in RAR parser\n\nCVE-2015-8932:\n\tUndefined behavior (invalid left shift) was discovered in libarchive, in how Compress streams are identified.  This could cause certain files to be mistakenly identified as Compress archives and fail to read.\n1348780: \nCVE-2015-8932 libarchive: Undefined behavior / invalid shiftleft in TAR parser\n\nCVE-2015-8931:\n\tUndefined behavior (signed integer overflow) was discovered in libarchive, in the MTREE parser\u0026#039;s calculation of maximum and minimum dates.  A crafted mtree file could potentially cause denial of service.\n1348779: \nCVE-2015-8931 libarchive: Undefined behavior (signed integer overflow) in mtree parser\n\nCVE-2015-8930:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted ISO file could cause the application to consume resources until it hit a memory limit, leading to a crash or denial of service.\n1349204: \nCVE-2015-8930 libarchive: Endless loop in ISO parser\n\nCVE-2015-8928:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted MTREE file could cause a limited out-of-bounds read, potentially disclosing contents of application memory.\n1348429: \nCVE-2015-8928 libarchive: Heap out of bounds read in mtree parser\n\nCVE-2015-8926:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted RAR file could cause the application to disclose a 128k block of memory from an uncontrolled location.\n1348424: \nCVE-2015-8926 libarchive: NULL pointer access in RAR parser\n\nCVE-2015-8925:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted MTREE file could cause a small out-of-bounds read, potentially disclosing a small amount of application memory.\n1348423: \nCVE-2015-8925 libarchive: Unclear invalid memory read in mtree parser\n\nCVE-2015-8924:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted TAR file could trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing the application to disclose a small amount of application memory.\n1348421: \nCVE-2015-8924 libarchive: Heap out of bounds read in TAR parser\n\nCVE-2015-8923:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted ZIP file could cause a few bytes of application memory in a 256-byte region to be disclosed.\n1348773: \nCVE-2015-8923 libarchive: Unclear crashes in ZIP parser\n\nCVE-2015-8922:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted 7Z file could trigger a NULL pointer dereference, causing the application to crash.\n1348419: \nCVE-2015-8922 libarchive: NULL pointer access in 7z parser\n\nCVE-2015-8921:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted mtree file could cause libarchive to read beyond a statically declared structure, potentially disclosing application memory.\n1348772: \nCVE-2015-8921 libarchive: Global out of bounds read in mtree parser\n\nCVE-2015-8920:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive.  A specially crafted AR archive could cause the application to read a single byte of application memory, potentially disclosing it to the attacker.\n1348416: \nCVE-2015-8920 libarchive: Stack out of bounds read in ar parser\n\nCVE-2015-8919:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted LZA/LZH file could cause a small out-of-bounds read, potentially disclosing a few bytes of application memory.\n1348414: \nCVE-2015-8919 libarchive: Heap out of bounds read in LHA/LZH parser\n\nCVE-2015-8917:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted CAB file could cause the application dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.\n1348413: \nCVE-2015-8917 libarchive: NULL pointer access in CAB parser\n\nCVE-2015-8916:\n\tA vulnerability was found in libarchive. A specially crafted RAR file could cause the application dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.\n1348412: \nCVE-2015-8916 libarchive: NULL pointer access in RAR parser through bsdtar\n",
