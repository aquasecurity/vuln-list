  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-10388:\n\tIt was discovered that the Kerberos client implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK used the sname field from the plain text part rather than encrypted part of the KDC reply message. A man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to impersonate Kerberos services to Java applications acting as Kerberos clients.\n1502038: \nCVE-2017-10388 OpenJDK: use of unprotected sname in Kerberos client (Libraries, 8178794)\n\nCVE-2017-10357:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Serialization). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9; Java SE Embedded: 8u144. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n1502614: \nCVE-2017-10357 OpenJDK: unbounded memory allocation in ObjectInputStream deserialization (Serialization, 8181597)\n\nCVE-2017-10356:\n\tIt was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK generated weak password-based encryption keys used to protect private keys stored in key stores. This made it easier to perform password guessing attacks to decrypt stored keys if an attacker could gain access to a key store.\n1503169: \nCVE-2017-10356 OpenJDK: weak protection of key stores against brute forcing (Security, 8181692)\n\nCVE-2017-10355:\n\tIt was found that the FtpClient implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK did not set connect and read timeouts by default. A malicious FTP server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to block execution of a Java application connecting to an FTP server.\n1502869: \nCVE-2017-10355 OpenJDK: no default network operations timeouts in FtpClient (Networking, 8181612)\n\nCVE-2017-10350:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JAX-WS).
