  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2013-4244:\n\tThe LZW decompressor in the gif2tiff tool in libtiff 4.0.3 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted GIF image.\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n996468: \nCVE-2013-4244 libtiff (gif2tiff): OOB Write in LZW decompressor\n\nCVE-2013-4243:\n\tMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the readgifimage function in the gif2tiff tool in libtiff 4.0.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted height and width values in a GIF image.\n996052: \nCVE-2013-4243 libtiff (gif2tiff): possible heap-based buffer overflow in readgifimage()\n\nCVE-2013-4232:\n\tUse-after-free vulnerability in the t2p_readwrite_pdf_image function in tools/tiff2pdf.c in libtiff 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possible execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image.\nA heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n995975: \nCVE-2013-4232 libtiff (tiff2pdf): use-after-free in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image()\n\nCVE-2013-4231:\n\tMultiple buffer overflows in libtiff before 4.0.3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted (1) extension block in a GIF image or (2) GIF raster image to tools/gif2tiff.c or (3) a long filename for a TIFF image to tools/rgb2ycbcr.c.  NOTE: vectors 1 and 3 are disputed by Red Hat, which states that the input cannot exceed the allocated buffer size.\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n995965: \nCVE-2013-4231 libtiff (gif2tiff): GIF LZW decoder missing datasize value check\n",
