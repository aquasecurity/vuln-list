  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-14367:\n\tA flaw was found in chrony when creating the PID file under the /var/run/chrony folder. The file is created during chronyd startup while still running as the root user, and when it\u0026#039;s opened for writing, chronyd does not check for an existing symbolic link with the same file name. This flaw allows an attacker with privileged access to create a symlink with the default PID file name pointing to any destination file in the system, resulting in data loss and a denial of service due to the path traversal.\n99999: \nCVE-2020-14367 chrony: Insecure writing to PID file\n",
