  "severity": "important",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-44717:\n\tThere's a flaw in golang's syscall.ForkExec() interface. An attacker who manages to first cause a file descriptor exhaustion for the process, then cause syscall.ForkExec() to be called repeatedly, could compromise data integrity and/or confidentiality in a somewhat uncontrolled way in programs linked with and using syscall.ForkExec().\n\nCVE-2021-44716:\n\tThere's an uncontrolled resource consumption flaw in golang's net/http library in the canonicalHeader() function. An attacker who submits specially crafted requests to applications linked with net/http's http2 functionality could cause excessive resource consumption that could lead to a denial of service or otherwise impact to system performance and resources.\n\nCVE-2021-41772:\n\tA vulnerability was found in archive/zip of the Go standard library. Applications written in Go where Reader.Open (the API implementing io/fs.FS introduced in Go 1.16) can panic when parsing a crafted ZIP archive containing completely invalid names or an empty filename argument.\n\nCVE-2021-41771:\n\tAn out of bounds read vulnerability was found in debug/macho of the Go standard library. When using the debug/macho standard library (stdlib) and malformed binaries are parsed using Open or OpenFat, it can cause golang to attempt to read outside of a slice (array) causing a panic when calling ImportedSymbols. An attacker can use this vulnerability to craft a file which causes an application using this library to crash resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2021-38297:\n\tA validation flaw was found in golang. When invoking functions from WASM modules built using GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js, passing very large arguments can cause portions of the module to be overwritten with data from the arguments. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2021-27919:\n\tAn out of bounds read vulnerability was found in golang. When using the archive/zip standard library (stdlib) and an unexpected file is parsed, it can cause golang to attempt to read outside of a slice (array) causing a panic in the runtime. A potential attacker can use this vulnerability to craft an archive which causes an application using this library to crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n",
