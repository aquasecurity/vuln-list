  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-33033:\n\tThe Linux kernel before 5.11.14 has a use-after-free in cipso_v4_genopt in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c because the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions is mishandled, aka CID-ad5d07f4a9cd. This leads to writing an arbitrary value.\n\nCVE-2021-31916:\n\tAn out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in list_devices in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Multi-device driver module in the Linux kernel. A bound check failure allows an attacker with special user (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) privilege to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n1946965: CVE-2021-31916 kernel: out of bounds array access in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c\n\nCVE-2021-31829:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF verification code. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This flaw allows a local user who can insert eBPF instructions, to use the eBPF verifier to abuse a spectre-like flaw and infer all system memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n1957788: CVE-2021-31829 kernel: protection of stack pointer against speculative pointer arithmetic can be bypassed to leak content of kernel memory\n\nCVE-2021-29155:\n\tA vulnerability was discovered in retrieve_ptr_limit in kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel mechanism to mitigate speculatively out-of-bounds loads (Spectre mitigation). In this flaw a local, \nspecial user privileged (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) BPF program running on affected systems may bypass the protection, and execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads from the kernel memory. This can be abused to extract contents of kernel memory via side-channel.\n1951595: CVE-2021-29155 kernel: protection for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations against speculatively out-of-bounds loads can be bypassed to leak content of kernel memory\n\nCVE-2021-29154:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernels eBPF implementation. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.   A local user with the ability to insert eBPF instructions can abuse a flaw in eBPF to corrupt memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1946684: CVE-2021-29154 kernel: Local privilege escalation due to incorrect BPF JIT branch displacement computation\n\nCVE-2021-28971:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. On some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled.\n1941784: CVE-2021-28971 kernel: System crash in intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c\n\nCVE-2021-28964:\n\tA race condition flaw was found in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel in btrfs file-system. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege to cause a denial of service due to not locking an extent buffer before a cloning operation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n1941804: CVE-2021-28964 kernel: race condition in get_old_root function in fs/btrfs/ctree.c because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation\n\nCVE-2021-28688:\n\t99999: \n\n\n\nCVE-2021-23133:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SCTP socket functionality that triggers a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n1948772: CVE-2021-23133 kernel: Race condition in sctp_destroy_sock list_del\n\nCVE-2020-29374:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access.\n1903249: CVE-2020-29374 kernel: the get_user_pages implementation when used for a copy-on-write page does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access\n\nCVE-2020-25673:\n\t1894558: CVE-2020-25673 kernel: non-blocking socket in llcp_sock_connect()\n\nCVE-2020-25672:\n\tNo description is available for this CVE.\n99999: \nCVE-2020-25672 kernel: memory leak in llcp_sock_connect()\n\nCVE-2020-25671:\n\tNo description is available for this CVE.\n99999: \nCVE-2020-25671 kernel: refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()\n\nCVE-2020-25670:\n\tNo description is available for this CVE.\n99999: \nCVE-2020-25670 kernel: refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()\n",
