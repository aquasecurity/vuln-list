  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2013-1862:\n\tIt was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive, a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of that user.\n\nCVE-2012-4558:\n\tCross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_proxy_balancer module's manager web interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the manager web interface, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's manager interface session.\n\nCVE-2012-3499:\n\tCross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the mod_info, mod_status, mod_imagemap, mod_ldap, and mod_proxy_ftp modules. An attacker could possibly use these flaws to perform XSS attacks if they were able to make the victim's browser generate an HTTP request with a specially-crafted Host header.\n",
