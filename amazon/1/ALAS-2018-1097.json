  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-3214:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Sound). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201, 7u191 and 8u182; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n1639301: \nCVE-2018-3214 OpenJDK: Infinite loop in RIFF format reader (Sound, 8205361)\n\nCVE-2018-3183:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Scripting). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. While the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n1639268: \nCVE-2018-3183 OpenJDK: Unrestricted access to scripting engine (Scripting, 8202936)\n\nCVE-2018-3180:\n\tVulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via SSL/TLS to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.

Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g. code installed by an administrator).
