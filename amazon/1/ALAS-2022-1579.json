  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-0943:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's suggest_try_change() function of the spellsuggest.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow and causing an application to crash, which leads to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0729:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to crashes within specific regexp patterns and strings and leads to an out-of-range vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0714:\n\tA heap-buffer-overflow flaw was found in vim's win_lbr_chartabsize() function of charset.c file. The issue occurs due to an incorrect 'vartabstop' value. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap-overflow, and can cause an application to crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0696:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vim's find_ucmd() function of usercmd.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a NULL pointer dereference. This issue leads to an application crash, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0685:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to a crash when using a special multi-byte character and leads to an out-of-range vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0629:\n\tA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's ga_concat_shorten_esc() function of src/testing.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file, triggering a stack-overflow. This issue can lead to an application crash, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0572:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in vim's ex_retab() function of indent.c file. This flaw occurs when repeatedly using :retab. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a crafted file triggering a heap-overflow.\n\nCVE-2022-0554:\n\tA flaw was found in vim that causes an out-of-range pointer offset vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0443:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to using freed memory which results in a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0417:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0413:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to using freed memory when the substitute uses a recursive function call, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0408:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to stack corruption when looking for spell suggestions and leads to a stack buffer overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-0393:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to a crash when recording and using Select mode and leads to an out-of-bounds read. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n",
