  },
  "severity": "Important",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2022 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-32148:\n\tImproper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 can be triggered by calling httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, which causes ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\nCVE-2022-30635:\n\tA flaw was found in golang. When calling Decoder.Decode on a message that contains deeply nested structures, a panic can occur due to stack exhaustion and allows an attacker to impact system availability.\n\nCVE-2022-30633:\n\tUncontrolled recursion in Unmarshal in encoding/xml before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via unmarshalling an XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field that uses the any field tag.\n\nCVE-2022-30632:\n\tA flaw was found in golang. Calling Glob on a path that contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic issue due to stack exhaustion. This can cause an attacker to impact availability.\n\nCVE-2022-30631:\n\tA flaw was found in golang. Calling the Reader.Read method on an archive that contains a large number of concatenated 0-length compressed files can cause a panic issue due to stack exhaustion.\n\nCVE-2022-30630:\n\tA flaw was found in the golang standard library, io/fs. Calling Glob on a path that contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic issue due to stack exhaustion. This could allow an attacker to impact availability.\n\nCVE-2022-30629:\n\tNon-random values for ticket_age_add in session tickets in crypto/tls before Go 1.17.11 and Go 1.18.3 allow an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session resumption.\n\nCVE-2022-29526:\n\tA flaw was found in the syscall.Faccessat function when calling a process by checking the group. This flaw allows an attacker to check the process group permissions rather than a member of the file's group, affecting system availability.\n\nCVE-2022-28327:\n\tAn integer overflow flaw was found in Golang's crypto/elliptic library. This flaw allows an attacker to use a crafted scaler input longer than 32 bytes, causing P256().ScalarMult or P256().ScalarBaseMult to panic, leading to a loss of availability.\n\nCVE-2022-28131:\n\tA flaw was found in golang encoding/xml. When calling Decoder.Skip while parsing a deeply nested XML document, a panic can occur due to stack exhaustion and allows an attacker to impact system availability.\n\nCVE-2022-27191:\n\tA broken cryptographic algorithm flaw was found in golang.org/x/crypto/ssh. This issue causes a client to fail authentification with RSA keys to servers that reject signature algorithms based on SHA-2, enabling an attacker to crash the server, resulting in a loss of availability.\n\nCVE-2022-24675:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in Golang's library encoding/pem. This flaw allows an attacker to use a large PEM input (more than 5 MB) ), causing a stack overflow in Decode, which leads to a loss of availability.\n\nCVE-2022-1996:\n\tAuthorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key in GitHub repository emicklei/go-restful prior to v3.8.0.\n\nCVE-2022-1962:\n\tA flaw was found in the golang standard library, go/parser. When calling any Parse functions on the Go source code, which contains deeply nested types or declarations, a panic can occur due to stack exhaustion. This issue allows an attacker to impact system availability.\n\nCVE-2022-1705:\n\tA flaw was found in golang. The HTTP/1 client accepted invalid Transfer-Encoding headers indicating \"chunked\" encoding. This issue could allow request smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly accepts the header as invalid.\n",
