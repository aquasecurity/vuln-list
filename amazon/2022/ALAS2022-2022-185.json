This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1199:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the Linux kernel by simulating amateur radio from the user space, resulting in a null-ptr-deref vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-1184:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel's filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1158:\n\tWhen the KVM updates the guest's page table entry, it will first use get_user_pages_fast() to pin the page, and when it fails (e.g. the vma-\u003eflags has VM_IO or VM_PFNMAP), it will get corresponding VMA where the page lies in through find_vma_intersection(), calculate the physical address, and map the page to the kernel virtual address through memremap(), and finally, write the update.\nThe problem is that when we get the vma through find_vma_intersection(), only VM_PFNMAP is checked, not both VM_IO and VM_PFNMAP. In the reproducer below, after the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION is completed, we replace the guest's memory mapping with the kernel-user shared region of io_uring and then perform the KVM_TRANSLATE operation, which finally triggers the page table entry update. Now, memremap() will return page_offset_base (direct mapping of all physical memory) + vaddr (the linear address of KVM_TRANSLATE) + vm_pgoff (the offset when io_uring performs mmap(2)), and use the return value as the base address for CMPXCHG (write 0x21 in this case). Since both vaddr and vm_pgoff are controllable by the user-mode process, writing may exceed the previously mapped guest memory space and trigger exceptions such as UAF. The vulnerability shares similarities with CVE-2021-22543.\n\nCVE-2022-1055:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the tc_new_tfilter function in net/sched/cls_api.c in the Linux kernel. The availability of local, unprivileged user namespaces allows privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2022-1016:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle return with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker.\n\nCVE-2022-1015:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue.\n\nCVE-2022-0854:\n\tA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space.\n\nCVE-2022-0847:\n\tA flaw was found in the way the \"flags\" member of the new pipe buffer structure was lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux kernel and could thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0742:\n\tA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ICMPv6 networking protocol, in the way a user generated malicious ICMPv6 packets.\nThis flaw allows a remote user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0500:\n\tA flaw was found in unrestricted eBPF usage by the BPF_BTF_LOAD, leading to a possible out-of-bounds memory write in the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem due to the way a user loads BTF. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0494:\n\tA kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2022-0492:\n\tThe cgroup release_agent is called with call_usermodehelper. The function call_usermodehelper starts the release_agent with a full set of capabilities. Therefore require capabilities when setting the release_agent.\n\nCVE-2022-0185:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length. An unprivileged (in case of unprivileged user namespaces enabled, otherwise needs namespaced CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege) local user able to open a filesystem that does not support the Filesystem Context API (and thus fallbacks to legacy handling) could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0171:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The existing KVM SEV API has a vulnerability that allows a non-root (host) user-level application to crash the host kernel by creating a confidential guest VM instance in AMD CPU that supports Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV).\n\nCVE-2022-0002:\n\tNon-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(r) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\nCVE-2022-0001:\n\tNon-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2021-26401:\n\tAMD recommends using a software mitigation for this issue, which the kernel is enabling by default. The Linux kernel will use the generic retpoline software mitigation, instead of the specialized AMD one, on AMD instances (*5a*). This is done by default, and no administrator action is needed.\n\nCVE-2021-26341:\n\tAMD recommends using a software mitigation for this issue, which the kernel is enabling by default. The Linux kernel will use the generic retpoline software mitigation, instead of the specialized AMD one, on AMD instances (*5a*). This is done by default, and no administrator action is needed.\n",
