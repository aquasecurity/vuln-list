  "severity": "Important",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2022 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-37434:\n\tA security vulnerability was found in zlib. The flaw triggered a heap-based buffer in inflate in the inflate.c function via a large gzip header extra field. This flaw is only applicable in the call inflateGetHeader.\n\nCVE-2022-29154:\n\tA flaw was found in rsync that is triggered by a victim rsync user/client connecting to a malicious rsync server. The server can copy and overwrite arbitrary files in the client's rsync target directory and subdirectories. This flaw allows a malicious server, or in some cases, another attacker who performs a man-in-the-middle attack, to potentially overwrite sensitive files on the client machine, resulting in further exploitation.\n\nCVE-2018-25032:\n\tAn out-of-bounds access flaw was found in zlib, which allows memory corruption when deflating (ex: when compressing) if the input has many distant matches. For some rare inputs with a large number of distant matches (crafted payloads), the buffer into which the compressed or deflated data is written can overwrite the distance symbol table which it overlays. This issue results in corrupted output due to invalid distances, which leads to out-of-bound access, corrupting the memory and potentially crashing the application.\n",
