  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-5750:\n\tThe acpi_smbus_hc_add function in drivers/acpi/sbshc.c in the Linux kernel, through 4.14.15, allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading dmesg data from an SBS HC printk call.\n1539706: \nCVE-2018-5750 kernel: Kernel address information leak in drivers/acpi/sbshc.c:acpi_smbus_hc_add() function potentially allowing KASLR bypass\n\nCVE-2018-5344:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u0026#039;s handling of loopback devices. An attacker, who has permissions to setup loopback disks, may create a denial of service or other unspecified actions.\n1533909: \nCVE-2018-5344 kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo_release serialization allowing denial-of-service\n\nCVE-2018-1000028:\n\tLinux kernel version after commit bdcf0a423ea1 - 4.15-rc4+, 4.14.8+, 4.9.76+, 4.4.111+ contains a Incorrect Access Control vulnerability in NFS server (nfsd) that can result in remote users reading or writing files they should not be able to via NFS. This attack appear to be exploitable via NFS server must export a filesystem with the \u0026quot;rootsquash\u0026quot; options enabled. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in after commit 1995266727fa.\n1540439: \nCVE-2018-1000028 kernel: Improper sorting of GIDs in nfsd can lead to incorrect permissions being applied\n\nCVE-2017-5753:\n\tAn industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor\u0026#039;s data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.\n1519778: \nCVE-2017-5753 hw: cpu: speculative execution bounds-check bypass\n\nCVE-2017-17741:\n\tLinux kernel compiled with the KVM virtualization (CONFIG_KVM) support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read access issue. It could occur when emulating vmcall instructions invoked by a guest. A guest user/process could use this flaw to disclose kernel memory bytes.\n1527112: \nCVE-2017-17741 kernel: kvm: stack-based out-of-bounds read via vmcall instruction\n\nCVE-2017-1000405:\n\tA flaw was found in the patches used to fix the \u0026#039;dirtycow\u0026#039; vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195). An attacker, able to run local code, can exploit a race condition in transparent huge pages to modify usually read-only huge pages.\n1516514: \nCVE-2017-1000405 kernel: pmd can become dirty without going through a COW cycle\n",
