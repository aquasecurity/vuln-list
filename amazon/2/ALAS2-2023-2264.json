This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.\n\nCVE-2023-4622:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.\n\nCVE-2023-45871:\n\tAn issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.\n\nCVE-2023-42755:\n\tA flaw was found in rsvp_change(). The root cause is an slab-out-of-bound access, but since the offset to the original pointer is an `unsign int` fully controlled by users, the behavior is usually a wild pointer access.\n\nCVE-2023-42753:\n\tThe upstream commit describes this issue as follows:\n\nThe missing IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro in ip_set_hash_netportnet can lead to the use of wrong `CIDR_POS(c)` for calculating array offsets, which can lead to integer underflow. As a result, it leads to slab out-of-bound access.\n\nCVE-2023-4244:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nDue to a race condition between nf_tables netlink control plane transaction and nft_set element garbage collection, it is possible to underflow the reference counter causing a use-after-free vulnerability.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 3e91b0ebd994635df2346353322ac51ce84ce6d8.\n\nCVE-2023-4207:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nWhen fw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 76e42ae831991c828cffa8c37736ebfb831ad5ec.\n\nCVE-2023-39194:\n\tA flaw was found in the XFRM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The specific flaw exists within the processing of state filters, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to an information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-39193:\n\tA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The sctp_mt_check did not validate the flag_count field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-39192:\n\tA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-3772:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to directly dereference a NULL pointer in xfrm_update_ae_params(), leading to a possible kernel crash and denial of service.\n",
