  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-65018:\n\tHeap buffer overflow in the libpng simplified API function png_image_finish_read when processing 16-bit interlaced PNGs with 8-bit output format. Attacker-crafted interlaced PNG files cause heap writes beyond allocated buffer bounds.\n\nCVE-2025-64720:\n\tLIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in png_image_read_composite when processing palette images with PNG_FLAG_OPTIMIZE_ALPHA enabled. The palette compositing code in png_init_read_transformations incorrectly applies background compositing during premultiplication, violating the invariant component \u003c= alpha x 257 required by the simplified PNG API. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.\n\nCVE-2025-64506:\n\tLIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, a heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_write_image_8bit function when processing 8-bit images through the simplified write API with convert_to_8bit enabled. The vulnerability affects 8-bit grayscale+alpha, RGB/RGBA, and images with incomplete row data. A conditional guard incorrectly allows 8-bit input to enter code expecting 16-bit input, causing reads up to 2 bytes beyond allocated buffer boundaries. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.\n\nCVE-2025-64505:\n\tA heap buffer over-read vulnerability exists in libpng's png_do_quantize function when processing PNG files with malformed palette indices. The vulnerability occurs when palette_lookup array bounds are not validated against externally-supplied image data, allowing an attacker to craft a PNG file with out-of-range palette indices that trigger out-of-bounds memory access.\n",
