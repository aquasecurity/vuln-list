Incomplete cleanup of multi-core shared buffers for some Intel(r) Processors may allow an authenticated user to enable information disclosure via local access.\n\nCVE-2022-1966:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Netfilter subsystem in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue.\n\nCVE-2022-1184:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel's filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-1012:\n\tDue to the small table perturb size, a memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TCP source port generation algorithm in the net/ipv4/tcp.c function. This flaw allows an attacker to leak information and may cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-0812:\n\tAn information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c function in RPCRDMA_HDRLEN_MIN (7) (in rpcrdma_max_call_header_size, rpcrdma_max_reply_header_size). This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.\n\nCVE-2022-0494:\n\tA kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with confidentiality.\n",
