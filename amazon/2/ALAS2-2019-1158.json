This violates security assumptions made by pam_shells and some daemons which allow access based on a user\u0026#039;s shell being listed in /etc/shells.  Under some circumstances, users which had their shell changed to /sbin/nologin could still access the system.\n1571094: \nCVE-2018-1113 setup: nologin listed in /etc/shells violates security expectations\n",
