  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-5732:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nAn attacker could have created a malicious link using bidirectional characters to spoof the location in the address bar when visited.\n\nCVE-2023-5730:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 118, Firefox ESR 115.3, and Thunderbird 115.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2023-5728:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nDuring garbage collection extra operations were performed on a object that should not be. This could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-5725:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nA malicious installed WebExtension could open arbitrary URLs, which under the right circumstance could be leveraged to collect sensitive user data.\n\nCVE-2023-5724:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nDrivers are not always robust to extremely large draw calls and in some cases this scenario could have led to a crash.\n\nCVE-2023-5721:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nIt was possible for certain browser prompts and dialogs to be activated or dismissed unintentionally by the user due to an insufficient activation-delay.\n",
