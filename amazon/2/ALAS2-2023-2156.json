  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-37211:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 114, Firefox ESR 102.12, and Thunderbird 102.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.13, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.13.\n\nCVE-2023-37208:\n\tWhen opening Diagcab files, Firefox did not warn the user that these files may contain malicious code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.13, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.13.\n\nCVE-2023-37207:\n\tA website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.13, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.13.\n\nCVE-2023-37202:\n\tCross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.13, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.13.\n\nCVE-2023-37201:\n\tAn attacker could have triggered a use-after-free condition when creating a WebRTC connection over HTTPS. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.13, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.13.\n",
