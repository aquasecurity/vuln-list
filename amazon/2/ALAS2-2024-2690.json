  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-9680:\n\tAn attacker was able to achieve code execution in the content process by exploiting a use-after-free in Animation timelines. We have had reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131.0.2, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3.1, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16.1.\n\nCVE-2024-9401:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 130, Firefox ESR 115.15, Firefox ESR 128.2, and Thunderbird 128.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9394:\n\tAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://devtools` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin JSON content. This access is limited to \"same site\" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9393:\n\tAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://pdf.js` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to \"same site\" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9392:\n\tA compromised content process could have allowed for the arbitrary loading of cross-origin pages. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n",
