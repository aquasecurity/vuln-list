  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2017-9229:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A SIGSEGV occurs in left_adjust_char_head() during regular expression compilation. Invalid handling of reg-\u003edmax in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, normally as an immediate denial-of-service condition.\n\nCVE-2017-9228:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2017-9227:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression searching. Invalid handling of reg-\u003edmin in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.\n\nCVE-2017-9226:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.\n",
