  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-29967:\n\tMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88 and Firefox ESR 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.11, Firefox \u003c 89, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.11.\n1966831: CVE-2021-29967 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 89 and Firefox ESR 78.11\n\nCVE-2021-29957:\n\tIf a MIME encoded email contains an OpenPGP inline signed or encrypted message part, but also contains an additional unprotected part, Thunderbird did not indicate that only parts of the message are protected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.10.2.\n1961503: CVE-2021-29957 Mozilla: Partial protection of inline OpenPGP message not indicated\n\nCVE-2021-29956:\n\tOpenPGP secret keys that were imported using Thunderbird version 78.8.1 up to version 78.10.1 were stored unencrypted on the user's local disk. The master password protection was inactive for those keys. Version 78.10.2 will restore the protection mechanism for newly imported keys, and will automatically protect keys that had been imported using affected Thunderbird versions. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.10.2.\n1961504: CVE-2021-29956 Mozilla: Thunderbird stored OpenPGP secret keys without master password protection\n",
