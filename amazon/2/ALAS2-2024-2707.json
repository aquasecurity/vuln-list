  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-47072:\n\tXStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to stack overflow from a manipulated binary input stream. XStream provides a BinaryStreamDriver with an own optimized serialization format. The format uses ids for string values as deduplication. The mapping for these ids are created on-the-fly at marshalling time. At unmarshalling time the reader's implementation simply used a simple one-time recursion after reading a mapping token to process the next normal token of the data stream. However, an endless recursion could be triggered with manipulated input data resulting in a stack overflow causing a denial of service.\n",
