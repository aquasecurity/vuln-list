  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-13259:\n\tIt was discovered that zsh does not properly validate the shebang of input files and it truncates it to the first 64 bytes. A local attacker may use this flaw to make zsh execute a different binary than what is expected, named with a substring of the shebang one.\n1626184: \nCVE-2018-13259 zsh: Improper handling of shebang line longer than 64\n\nCVE-2018-0502:\n\tAn issue was discovered in zsh before 5.6. The beginning of a #! script file was mishandled, potentially leading to an execve call to a program named on the second line.\n1626187: \nCVE-2018-0502 zsh: Improper parsing of the shebang line with special chars\n",
