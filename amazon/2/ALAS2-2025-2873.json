  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-5283:\n\tUse after free in libvpx in Google Chrome prior to 137.0.7151.55 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: Medium)\n\nDuplicate: https://console.harmony.a2z.com/al-cve-eval/cve/TEMP-1106689-EC87F6\n\nCVE-2025-5269:\n\tMemory safety bug present in Firefox ESR 128.10, and Thunderbird 128.10. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-5268:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 138, Thunderbird 138, Firefox ESR 128.10, and Thunderbird 128.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 139 and Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-5267:\n\tA clickjacking vulnerability could have been used to trick a user into leaking saved payment card details to a malicious page. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 139 and Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-5266:\n\tScript elements loading cross-origin resources generated load and error events which leaked information enabling XS-Leaks attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 139 and Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-5265:\n\tDue to insufficient escaping of the ampersand character in the \"Copy as cURL\" feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user's system.\n*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 139, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.24, and Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-5264:\n\tDue to insufficient escaping of the newline character in the \"Copy as cURL\" feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user's system. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 139, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.24, and Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-5263:\n\tError handling for script execution was incorrectly isolated from web content, which could have allowed cross-origin leak attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 139, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.24, and Firefox ESR \u003c 128.11.\n\nCVE-2025-4919:\n\tAn attacker was able to perform an out-of-bounds read or write on a JavaScript object by confusing array index sizes. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138.0.4, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10.1, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.23.1.\n\nCVE-2025-4918:\n\tAn attacker was able to perform an out-of-bounds read or write on a JavaScript `Promise` object. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138.0.4, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10.1, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.23.1.\n",
