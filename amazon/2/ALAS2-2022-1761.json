  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-48809:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata\n\nCVE-2022-48805:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n\nCVE-2022-48804:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvt_ioctl: fix array_index_nospec in vt_setactivate\n\nCVE-2022-48799:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf: Fix list corruption in perf_cgroup_switch()\n\nCVE-2022-48786:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal\n\nCVE-2022-48760:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix hang in usb_kill_urb by adding memory barriers\n\nCVE-2022-48757:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix information leakage in /proc/net/ptype\n\nCVE-2022-48743:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: amd-xgbe: Fix skb data length underflow\n\nCVE-2022-48742:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtnetlink: make sure to refresh master_dev/m_ops in __rtnl_newlink()\n\nCVE-2022-48724:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Fix potential memory leak in intel_setup_irq_remapping()\n\nCVE-2022-48711:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntipc: improve size validations for received domain records\n\nCVE-2022-24448:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. When an application tries to open a directory (using the O_DIRECTORY flag) in a mounted NFS filesystem, a lookup operation is performed. If the NFS server returns a file as a result of the lookup, the NFS filesystem returns an uninitialized file descriptor instead of the expected ENOTDIR value. This flaw leads to the kernel's data leak into the userspace.\n\nCVE-2022-23960:\n\tThe Amazon Linux kernel now enables, by default, a software mitigation for this issue, on all ARM-based EC2 instance types.\n\nCVE-2022-0617:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's UDF file system functionality in the way the user triggers the udf_file_write_iter function for a malicious UDF image. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0435:\n\tA stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.\n\nCVE-2022-0330:\n\tA random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-0002:\n\tNon-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(r) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\nCVE-2022-0001:\n\tNon-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2021-47620:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: refactor malicious adv data check\n\nCVE-2021-4197:\n\tAn unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-38199:\n\tA flaw was found in the hanging of mounts in the Linux kernel's NFS4 subsystem where remote servers are unreachable for the client during migration of data from one server to another (during trunking detection). This flaw allows a remote NFS4 server (if the client is connected) to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-26401:\n\tAMD recommends using a software mitigation for this issue, which the kernel is enabling by default. The Linux kernel will use the generic retpoline software mitigation, instead of the specialized AMD one, on AMD instances (*5a*). This is done by default, and no administrator action is needed.\n\nCVE-2021-26341:\n\tAMD recommends using a software mitigation for this issue, which the kernel is enabling by default. The Linux kernel will use the generic retpoline software mitigation, instead of the specialized AMD one, on AMD instances (*5a*). This is done by default, and no administrator action is needed.\n\nCVE-2020-36322:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in fuse_do_getattr in fs/fuse/dir.c in the kernel side of the FUSE filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2018-25020:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw in the Linux kernel BPF subsystem was found in the way users run BPF with long jump over an instruction sequence where inner instructions require substantial expansions into multiple BPF instructions. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n",
