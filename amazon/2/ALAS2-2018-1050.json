  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-5390:\n\tA flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.\n\nCVE-2018-13405:\n\tA vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not.\n\nCVE-2018-13094:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the XFS filesystem in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c in the Linux kernel. A NULL pointer dereference may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs_da_shrink_inode() is called with a NULL bp. This can lead to a system crash and a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2018-13093:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the XFS filesystem in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel. There is a NULL pointer dereference leading to a system panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode-\u003ei_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during an allocation.\n",
