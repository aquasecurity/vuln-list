  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-27538:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when an SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited reuse.\n\nlibcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, two SSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily.\n\nCVE-2023-27537:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\nlibcurl supports sharing HSTS data between separate \"handles\". This sharing was introduced without considerations for doing this sharing across separate threads, but there was no indication of this fact in the documentation. Due to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data could end up doing a double-free or use-after-free.\n\nCVE-2023-27536:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when the GSS delegation (CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION) option had been changed that could have changed the user's permissions in a second transfer.\n\nlibcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, this GSS delegation setting was left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily, affecting krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers.\n\nCVE-2023-27535:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\nlibcurl would reuse a previously created FTP connection even when one or more options had been changed that could have made the effective user a very different one, thus leading to the doing the second transfer with wrong credentials.\n\nCVE-2023-27534:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\ncurl supports SFTP transfers. curl's SFTP implementation offers a special feature in the path component of URLs: a tilde (~) character as the first path element in the path to denotes a path relative to the user's home directory. This is supported because of wording in the once proposed to-become RFC draft that was to dictate how SFTP URLs work.\n\nDue to a bug, the handling of the tilde in SFTP path did however not only replace it when it is used stand-alone as the first path element but also wrongly when used as a mere prefix in the first element.\n\nUsing a path like /~2/foo when accessing a server using the user dan (with home directory /home/dan) would then quite surprisingly access the file /home/dan2/foo.\n\nThis can be taken advantage of to circumvent filtering or worse.\n\nCVE-2023-27533:\n\tThe curl advisory describes this issue as follows:\n\ncurl supports communicating using the TELNET protocol and as a part of this it offers users to pass on user name and \"telnet options\" for the server negotiation.\n\nDue to lack of proper input scrubbing and without it being the documented functionality, curl would pass on user name and telnet options to the server as provided. This could allow users to pass in carefully crafted content that pass on content or do option negotiation without the application intending to do so. In particular if an application for example allows users to provide the data or parts of the data.\n",
