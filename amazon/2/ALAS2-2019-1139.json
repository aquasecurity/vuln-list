  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-1000301:\n\tcurl version curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.59.0 contains a CWE-126: Buffer Over-read vulnerability in denial of service that can result in curl can be tricked into reading data beyond the end of a heap based buffer used to store downloaded RTSP content.. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in curl \u0026lt; 7.20.0 and curl \u0026gt;= 7.60.0.\n1575536: \nCVE-2018-1000301 curl: Out-of-bounds heap read when missing RTSP headers allows information leak of denial of service\n\nCVE-2018-1000122:\n\tA buffer over-read exists in curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the RTSP+RTP handling code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or information leakage\n1553398: \nCVE-2018-1000122 curl: RTSP RTP buffer over-read\n\nCVE-2018-1000121:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way libcurl checks values returned by the openldap ldap_get_attribute_ber() function. A malicious LDAP server could use this flaw to crash a libcurl client application via a specially crafted LDAP reply.\n1552631: \nCVE-2018-1000121 curl: LDAP NULL pointer dereference\n\nCVE-2018-1000120:\n\tIt was found that libcurl did not safely parse FTP URLs when using the CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD method. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted FTP URL to an application using libcurl, could write a NULL byte at an arbitrary location, resulting in a crash, or an unspecified behavior.\n1552628: \nCVE-2018-1000120 curl: FTP path trickery leads to NIL byte out of bounds write\n\nCVE-2018-1000007:\n\tlibcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client\u0026#039;s request.\nIt was found that curl and libcurl might send their Authentication header to a third party HTTP server upon receiving an HTTP REDIRECT reply. This could leak authentication token to external entities.\n1537125: \nCVE-2018-1000007 curl: HTTP authentication leak in redirects\n",
