  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2015-8710:\n\tIt was discovered that libxml2 could access out-of-bounds memory when parsing unclosed HTML comments. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an application linked against libxml2, could cause the application to disclose heap memory contents.\n1213957: \nCVE-2015-8710 libxml2: out-of-bounds memory access when parsing an unclosed HTML comment\n\nCVE-2015-8317:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to leak potentially sensitive information.\n1281930: \nCVE-2015-8317 libxml2: Out-of-bounds heap read when parsing file with unfinished xml declaration\n\nCVE-2015-8242:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to leak potentially sensitive information.\n1281950: \nCVE-2015-8242 libxml2: Buffer overread with HTML parser in push mode in xmlSAX2TextNode\n\nCVE-2015-8241:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to leak potentially sensitive information.\n1281936: \nCVE-2015-8241 libxml2: Buffer overread with XML parser in xmlNextChar\n\nCVE-2015-7942:\n\tThe xmlParseConditionalSections function in parser.c in libxml2 does not properly skip intermediary entities when it stops parsing invalid input, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via crafted XML data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-7941.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 parsed certain crafted XML input. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash causing a denial of service.\n1276297: \nCVE-2015-7942 libxml2: heap-based buffer overflow in xmlParseConditionalSections()\n\nCVE-2015-7941:\n\tlibxml2 2.9.2 does not properly stop parsing invalid input, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and libxml2 crash) via crafted XML data to the (1) xmlParseEntityDecl or (2) xmlParseConditionalSections function in parser.c, as demonstrated by non-terminated entities.\nA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to crash.\n1274222: \nCVE-2015-7941 libxml2: Out-of-bounds memory access\n\nCVE-2015-7500:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to crash.\n1281943: \nCVE-2015-7500 libxml2: Heap buffer overflow in xmlParseMisc\n\nCVE-2015-7499:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to leak potentially sensitive information.\n1281925: \nCVE-2015-7499 libxml2: Heap-based buffer overflow in xmlGROW\n\nCVE-2015-7498:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to crash.\n1281879: \nCVE-2015-7498 libxml2: Heap-based buffer overflow in xmlParseXmlDecl\n\nCVE-2015-7497:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to crash.\n1281862: \nCVE-2015-7497 libxml2: Heap-based buffer overflow in xmlDictComputeFastQKey\n\nCVE-2015-5312:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to use an excessive amount of CPU.\n1276693: \nCVE-2015-5312 libxml2: CPU exhaustion when processing specially crafted XML input\n\nCVE-2015-1819:\n\tA denial of service flaw was found in the way the libxml2 library parsed certain XML files. An attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when parsed by an application using libxml2, could cause that application to use an excessive amount of memory.\n1211278: \nCVE-2015-1819 libxml2: denial of service processing a crafted XML document\n",
