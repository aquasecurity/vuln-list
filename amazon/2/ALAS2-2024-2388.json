  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-45284:\n\tpath/filepath: recognize device names with trailing spaces and superscripts\n\nThe IsLocal function did not correctly detect reserved names in some cases:\n\n - reserved names followed by spaces, such as \"COM1 \".\n - \"COM\" or \"LPT\" followed by a superscript 1, 2, or 3.\n\nIsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.\n\nCVE-2023-45283:\n\tpath/filepath: recognize \\??\\ as a Root Local Device path prefix.\n\nOn Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent\nto a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may be used to\naccess arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x\nis equivalent to the more common path c:\\x.\n\nThe filepath package did not recognize paths with a \\??\\ prefix as special.\n\nClean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into\nthe root local device path \\??\\b. It will now convert this\npath into .\\??\\b.\n\nIsAbs did not report paths beginning with \\??\\ as absolute.\nIt now does so.\n\nVolumeName now reports the \\??\\ prefix as a volume name.\n\nJoin(`\\`, `??`, `b`) could convert a seemingly innocent\nsequence of path elements into the root local device path\n\\??\\b. It will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b.\n\nCVE-2023-39326:\n\tA malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.\n",
