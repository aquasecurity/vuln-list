  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-8780:\n\tIt was found that the methods from the Dir class did not properly handle strings containing the NULL byte. An attacker, able to inject NULL bytes in a path, could possibly trigger an unspecified behavior of the ruby script.\n1561949: \nCVE-2018-8780 ruby: Unintentional directory traversal by poisoned NULL byte in Dir\n\nCVE-2018-8779:\n\tIt was found that the UNIXSocket::open and UNIXServer::open ruby methods did not handle the NULL byte properly. An attacker, able to inject NULL bytes in the socket path, could possibly trigger an unspecified behavior of the ruby script.\n1561948: \nCVE-2018-8779 ruby: Unintentional socket creation by poisoned NULL byte in UNIXServer and UNIXSocket\n\nCVE-2018-8778:\n\tA integer underflow was found in the way String#unpack decodes the unpacking format. An attacker, able to control the unpack format, could use this flaw to disclose arbitrary parts of the application\u0026#039;s memory.\n1561953: \nCVE-2018-8778 ruby: Buffer under-read in String#unpack\n\nCVE-2018-8777:\n\tIt was found that WEBrick could be forced to use an excessive amount of memory during the processing of HTTP requests, leading to a Denial of Service. An attacker could use this flaw to send huge requests to a WEBrick application, resulting in the server running out of memory.\n1561950: \nCVE-2018-8777 ruby: DoS by large request in WEBrick\n\nCVE-2018-6914:\n\tIt was found that the tmpdir and tempfile modules did not sanitize their file name argument. An attacker with control over the name could create temporary files and directories outside of the dedicated directory.\n1561947: \nCVE-2018-6914 ruby: Unintentional file and directory creation with directory traversal in tempfile and tmpdir\n\nCVE-2018-16396:\n\tAn issue was discovered in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. It does not taint strings that result from unpacking tainted strings with some formats.\n1643089: \nCVE-2018-16396 ruby: Tainted flags are not propagated in Array#pack and String#unpack with some directives\n\nCVE-2018-1000079:\n\tRubyGems version Ruby 2.2 series: 2.2.9 and earlier, Ruby 2.3 series: 2.3.6 and earlier, Ruby 2.4 series: 2.4.3 and earlier, Ruby 2.5 series: 2.5.0 and earlier, prior to trunk revision 62422 contains a Directory Traversal vulnerability in gem installation that can result in the gem could write to arbitrary filesystem locations during installation. This attack appear to be exploitable via the victim must install a malicious gem.
