  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-24921:\n\tA stack overflow flaw was found in Golang's regexp module, which can crash the runtime if the application using regexp accepts very long or arbitrarily long regexps from untrusted sources that have sufficient nesting depths. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send large regexps with deep nesting to the application. Triggering this flaw leads to a crash of the runtime, which causes a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-23806:\n\tCurve.IsOnCurve in crypto/elliptic in Go before 1.16.14 and 1.17.x before 1.17.7 can incorrectly return true in situations with a big.Int value that is not a valid field element.\n\nCVE-2022-23773:\n\tcmd/go in Go before 1.16.14 and 1.17.x before 1.17.7 can misinterpret branch names that falsely appear to be version tags. This can lead to incorrect access control if an actor is supposed to be able to create branches but not tags.\n\nCVE-2022-23772:\n\tRat.SetString in math/big in Go before 1.16.14 and 1.17.x before 1.17.7 has an overflow that can lead to Uncontrolled Memory Consumption.\n\nCVE-2021-44717:\n\tThere's a flaw in golang's syscall.ForkExec() interface. An attacker who manages to first cause a file descriptor exhaustion for the process, then cause syscall.ForkExec() to be called repeatedly, could compromise data integrity and/or confidentiality in a somewhat uncontrolled way in programs linked with and using syscall.ForkExec().\n\nCVE-2021-44716:\n\tThere's an uncontrolled resource consumption flaw in golang's net/http library in the canonicalHeader() function. An attacker who submits specially crafted requests to applications linked with net/http's http2 functionality could cause excessive resource consumption that could lead to a denial of service or otherwise impact to system performance and resources.\n\nCVE-2021-41772:\n\tA vulnerability was found in archive/zip of the Go standard library. Applications written in Go where Reader.Open (the API implementing io/fs.FS introduced in Go 1.16) can panic when parsing a crafted ZIP archive containing completely invalid names or an empty filename argument.\n\nCVE-2021-41771:\n\tAn out of bounds read vulnerability was found in debug/macho of the Go standard library. When using the debug/macho standard library (stdlib) and malformed binaries are parsed using Open or OpenFat, it can cause golang to attempt to read outside of a slice (array) causing a panic when calling ImportedSymbols. An attacker can use this vulnerability to craft a file which causes an application using this library to crash resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2021-39293:\n\tA vulnerability was found in archive/zip of the Go standard library. Applications written in Go can panic or potentially exhaust system memory when parsing malformed ZIP files. An attacker capable of submitting a crafted ZIP file to a Go application using archive/zip to process that file could cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion or panic. This particular flaw is an incomplete fix for a previous flaw.\n\nCVE-2021-38297:\n\tA validation flaw was found in golang. When invoking functions from WASM modules built using GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js, passing very large arguments can cause portions of the module to be overwritten with data from the arguments. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2021-36221:\n\tA race condition flaw was found in Go. The incoming requests body weren't closed after the handler panic and as a consequence this could lead to ReverseProxy crash.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to Availability.\n\nCVE-2021-33198:\n\tA flaw was found in Go, where it attempts to allocate excessive memory. This issue may cause panic or unrecoverable fatal error if passed inputs with very large exponents. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-33197:\n\tA flaw was found in Go, acting as an unintended proxy or intermediary, where ReverseProxy forwards connection headers if the first one was empty. This flaw allows an attacker to drop arbitrary headers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2021-33195:\n\tA flaw was found in Go. The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr functions in the net package and methods on the Resolver type, may return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS, allowing injection of unexpected contents. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n\nCVE-2021-27919:\n\tarchive/zip in Go 1.16.x before 1.16.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) upon attempted use of the Reader.Open API for a ZIP archive in which ../ occurs at the beginning of any filename.\n\nCVE-2021-27918:\n\tAn infinite loop vulnerability was found in golang. If an application defines a custom token parser initializing with `xml.NewTokenDecoder` it is possible for the parsing loop to never return. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious XML document which has an XML element with `EOF` within it, causing the parsing application to endlessly loop, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n",
