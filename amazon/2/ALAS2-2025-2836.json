  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-12421:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user.\n\nCVE-2020-12420:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2020-12419:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nWhen processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the associated window may die; causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2020-12418:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nManipulating individual parts of a URL object could have caused an out-of-bounds read, leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript.\n\nCVE-2020-12417:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\n\nDue to confusion about ValueTags on JavaScript Objects, an object may pass through the type barrier, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n",
