  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-26696:\n\tCertain crafted MIME email messages that claimed to contain an encrypted OpenPGP message, which instead contained an OpenPGP signed message, were wrongly shown as being encrypted. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 136 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-26695:\n\tWhen requesting an OpenPGP key from a WKD server, an incorrect padding size was used and a network observer could have learned the length of the requested email address. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 136 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1938:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 135, Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 128.7, and Thunderbird 128.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1937:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 135, Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 115.20, Firefox ESR 128.7, and Thunderbird 128.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.21, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1936:\n\tjar: URLs retrieve local file content packaged in a ZIP archive. The null and everything after it was ignored when retrieving the content from the archive, but the fake extension after the null was used to determine the type of content. This could have been used to hide code in a web extension disguised as something else like an image. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1935:\n\tA web page could trick a user into setting that site as the default handler for a custom URL protocol. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1934:\n\tIt was possible to interrupt the processing of a RegExp bailout and run additional JavaScript, potentially triggering garbage collection when the engine was not expecting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1933:\n\tOn 64-bit CPUs, when the JIT compiles WASM i32 return values they can pick up bits from left over memory. This can potentially cause them to be treated as a different type. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.21, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1932:\n\tAn inconsistent comparator in xslt/txNodeSorter could have resulted in potentially exploitable out-of-bounds access. Only affected version 122 and later. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2025-1931:\n\tIt was possible to cause a use-after-free in the content process side of a WebTransport connection, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.21, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8, Thunderbird \u003c 136, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.8.\n\nCVE-2024-43097:\n\tIn resizeToAtLeast of SkRegion.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.\n\nCVE-2022-29913:\n\tThe parent process would not properly check whether the Speech Synthesis feature is enabled, when receiving instructions from a child process. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 91.9.\n\nCVE-2022-29912:\n\tRequests initiated through reader mode did not properly omit cookies with a SameSite attribute. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 91.9, Firefox ESR \u003c 91.9, and Firefox \u003c 100.\n",
