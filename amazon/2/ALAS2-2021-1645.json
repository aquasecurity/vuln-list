  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-21351:\n\tXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\nCVE-2021-21350:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code only by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-21349:\n\tXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\nCVE-2021-21348:\n\tXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to occupy a thread that consumes maximum CPU time and will never return. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\nCVE-2021-21347:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream. A remote attacker may be able to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-21346:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream. A remote attacker can load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-21345:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream. A remote attacker, who has sufficient rights, can execute commands of the host by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-21344:\n\tA flaw was found in xstream. A remote attacker may be able to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-21343:\n\tXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in the deletion of a file on the local host. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\nCVE-2021-21341:\n\tXStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n",
