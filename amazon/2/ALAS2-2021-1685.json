data corruption bug in raid1 arrays using bitmaps.\nWithout this fix, the bitmap bits for the failed I/O end up being cleared.\n\nSince we are in the failure leg of raid1_end_write_request, the request\neither needs to be retried (R1BIO_WriteError) or failed (R1BIO_Degraded).\n\nCVE-2021-46939:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Restructure

report length doesn't\ntake into account that report-\u003esize can be zero. When running the\nsyzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to\ncalculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to\nthe usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.\n\nTo fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero\nreport size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it\nfrom hid_submit_ctrl().\n\nCVE-2021-3573:\n\tA flaw use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct HCIUNBLOCKADDR or other way triggers race condition of the call hci_unregister_dev() together with one of the calls hci_sock_blacklist_add(), hci_sock_blacklist_del(), hci_get_conn_info(), hci_get_auth_info(). A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-3564:\n\tA flaw double-free memory corruption in the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem was found in the way user attach malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2021-33624:\n\tIn kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.13, a branch can be mispredicted (e.g., because of type confusion) and consequently an unprivileged BPF program can read arbitrary memory locations via a side-channel attack, aka CID-9183671af6db.\n\nCVE-2021-33034:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in hci_send_acl in the bluetooth host controller interface (HCI) in Linux kernel, where a local attacker with an access rights could cause a denial of service problem on the system  The issue results from the object hchan, freed in hci_disconn_loglink_complete_evt, yet still used in other places. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity, confidentiality and system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-32399:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of the removal of Bluetooth HCI controllers. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to exploit a race condition, leading to corrupted memory and possible privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-29650:\n\tA denial-of-service (DoS) flaw was identified  in the Linux kernel due to an incorrect memory barrier in xt_replace_table in net/netfilter/x_tables.c in the netfilter subsystem.\n\nCVE-2021-0129:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nCVE-2020-26558:\n\tA vulnerability was found in the bluez, where Passkey Entry protocol used in Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), Secure Connections (SC) and LE Secure Connections (LESC) of the Bluetooth Core Specification is vulnerable to an impersonation attack where an active attacker can impersonate the initiating device without any previous knowledge.\n",
