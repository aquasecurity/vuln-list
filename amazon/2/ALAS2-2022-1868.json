  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-3099:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's do_cmdline() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. The issue triggers when an invalid line number on :for is ignored. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-3037:\n\tUse After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0322.\n\nCVE-2022-3016:\n\tA heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's get_next_valid_entry() function of the src/quickfix.c file. The issue occurs because vim is using freed memory when the location list is changed in autocmd. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2982:\n\tA heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's qf_fill_buffer() function of the src/quickfix.c file. The issue occurs because vim uses freed memory when recursively using 'quickfixtextfunc.' This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2980:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in vim's do_mouse() function of the src/mouse.c file. The issue occurs with a mouse click when it is not initialized. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted input file, triggering the vulnerability that could cause an application to crash.\n\nCVE-2022-2946:\n\tA flaw was found in vim, where it is vulnerable to a use-after-free in the vim_vsnprintf_typval function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash a program, use unexpected values, or execute code.\n\nCVE-2022-2923:\n\tA flaw was found in vim, where it is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the sug_filltree function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash the software.\n\nCVE-2022-2889:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim in the find_var_also_in_script function in the evalvars.c file. This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2862:\n\tUse After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0221.\n\nCVE-2022-2849:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0220.\n\nCVE-2022-2845:\n\tBuffer Over-read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0218.\n\nCVE-2022-2819:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. The vulnerability occurs due to illegal memory access and leads to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-2817:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim in the string_quote function in the strings.c file. This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2816:\n\tAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Vim in the check_vim9_unlet function in the vim9cmds.c file. This issue occurs because of invalid memory access when compiling the unlet command when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the out-of-bounds read, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2345:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim in the skipwhite function in the charset.c file. This issue occurs because an already freed memory is used when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the use-after-free, and cause the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2344:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow was found in Vim in the ins_compl_add function in the insexpand.c file. This issue occurs due to a read past the end of a buffer when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the heap-based buffer overflow, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2343:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow was found in Vim in the ins_compl_add function in the insexpand.c file. This issue occurs due to a read past the end of a buffer when a specially crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker who can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file into triggering the heap-based buffer overflow, causing the application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2304:\n\tA stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Vim's spell_dump_compl() function of the src/spell.c file. This issue occurs because the spell dump goes beyond the end of an array when crafted input is processed. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds write that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.\n\nCVE-2022-2289:\n\tUse After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.\n\nCVE-2022-2288:\n\tOut-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.\n\nCVE-2022-2287:\n\tOut-of-bounds Read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.\n\nCVE-2022-2286:\n\tOut-of-bounds Read in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.\n\nCVE-2022-2285:\n\tInteger Overflow or Wraparound in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.\n\nCVE-2022-2284:\n\tHeap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.\n\nCVE-2022-2264:\n\tA heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Vim's inc() function of misc2.c. This issue occurs because Vim reads beyond the end of the line with a put command. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds read that causes a crash in the CLI tool.\n\nCVE-2022-2257:\n\tA flaw was found in vim, which is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read in the msg_outtrans_special function. This flaw allows a specially crafted file to crash software or execute code when opened in vim.\n",
