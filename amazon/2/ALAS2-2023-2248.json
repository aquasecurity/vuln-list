  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-4584:\n\tMemory safety bug\n\nCVE-2023-4056:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, Firefox ESR 102.13, Thunderbird 115.0, and Thunderbird 102.13. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-3417:\n\tThunderbird allowed the Text Direction Override Unicode Character in filenames. An email attachment could be incorrectly shown as being a document file, while in  fact it was an executable file. Newer versions of Thunderbird will strip the character and show the correct file extension. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 115.0.1.\n",
