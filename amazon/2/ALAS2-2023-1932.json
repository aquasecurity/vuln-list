  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-53032:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: Fix overflow before widen in the bitmap_ip_create() function.\n\nCVE-2023-52901:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: xhci: Check endpoint is valid before dereferencing it\n\nCVE-2023-52900:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix general protection fault in nilfs_btree_insert()\n\nCVE-2023-23455:\n\tatm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).\n\nCVE-2023-0461:\n\tThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.\n\nThere is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock.\n\nWhen CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.\n\nThe setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c\n\nCVE-2023-0459:\n\tDetected a few exploitable gadgets that could leak secret memory through a side-channel such as MDS as well as insufficient hardening of the usercopy functions against spectre-v1.\n\nCVE-2023-0394:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash.\n\nCVE-2023-0045:\n\tThe Linux kernel does not correctly mitigate SMT attacks, as discovered through a strange pattern in the kernel API using STIBP as a mitigation, leaving the process exposed for a short period of time after a syscall. The kernel also does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall.\n\nCVE-2022-50430:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmmc: vub300: fix warning - do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING\n\nCVE-2022-50414:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: fcoe: Fix transport not deattached when fcoe_if_init() fails\n\nCVE-2022-50411:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()\n\nCVE-2022-50405:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/tunnel: wait until all sk_user_data reader finish before releasing the sock\n\nCVE-2022-50401:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: under NFSv4.1, fix double svc_xprt_put on rpc_create failure\n\nCVE-2022-50389:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntpm: tpm_crb: Add the missed acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak\n\nCVE-2022-50381:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: fix a crash in mempool_free\n\nCVE-2022-50365:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nskbuff: Account for tail adjustment during pull operations\n\nCVE-2022-50349:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: tifm: fix possible memory leak in tifm_7xx1_switch_media()\n\nCVE-2022-50346:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: init quota for 'old.inode' in 'ext4_rename'\n\nCVE-2022-50343:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrapidio: fix possible name leaks when rio_add_device() fails\n\nCVE-2022-50333:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: jfs: fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbDiscardAG\n\nCVE-2022-50282:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchardev: fix error handling in cdev_device_add()\n\nCVE-2022-50280:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npnode: terminate at peers of source\n\nCVE-2022-50278:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPNP: fix name memory leak in pnp_alloc_dev()\n\nCVE-2022-50275:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: Add the missed acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak\n\nCVE-2022-50253:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: make sure skb-\u003elen != 0 when redirecting to a tunneling device\n\nCVE-2022-50252:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigb: Do not free q_vector unless new one was allocated\n\nCVE-2022-50251:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmmc: vub300: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()\n\nCVE-2022-48991:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths\n\nCVE-2022-48988:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmemcg: fix possible use-after-free in memcg_write_event_control()\n\nCVE-2022-48987:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: v4l2-dv-timings.c: fix too strict blanking sanity checks\n\nCVE-2022-48978:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: core: fix shift-out-of-bounds in hid_report_raw_event\n\nCVE-2022-48972:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmac802154: fix missing INIT_LIST_HEAD in ieee802154_if_add()\n\nCVE-2022-48956:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: avoid use-after-free in ip6_fragment()\n\nCVE-2022-48949:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigb: Initialize mailbox message for VF reset\n\nCVE-2022-48947:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: L2CAP: Fix u8 overflow\n\nCVE-2022-48946:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudf: Fix preallocation discarding at indirect extent boundary\n\nCVE-2022-47929:\n\tIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with \"tc qdisc\" and \"tc class\" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.\n\nCVE-2022-45934:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets.\n\nCVE-2022-42329:\n\tGuests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).\n\nCVE-2022-42328:\n\tGuests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).\n\nCVE-2022-3643:\n\tGuests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.\n",
