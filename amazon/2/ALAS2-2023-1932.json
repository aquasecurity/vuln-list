  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-23455:\n\tatm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).\n\nCVE-2023-0459:\n\tDetected a few exploitable gadgets that could leak secret memory through a side-channel such as MDS as well as insufficient hardening of the usercopy functions against spectre-v1.\n\nCVE-2023-0394:\n\tA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash.\n\nCVE-2023-0045:\n\tThe Linux kernel does not correctly mitigate SMT attacks, as discovered through a strange pattern in the kernel API using STIBP as a mitigation, leaving the process exposed for a short period of time after a syscall. The kernel also does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall.\n\nCVE-2022-47929:\n\tIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with \"tc qdisc\" and \"tc class\" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.\n\nCVE-2022-45934:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets.\n\nCVE-2022-42329:\n\tGuests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).\n\nCVE-2022-42328:\n\tGuests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).\n\nCVE-2022-3643:\n\tGuests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.\n",
