Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection. The Commandline class can emit double-quoted strings without proper escaping, allowing shell injection attacks. The BourneShell class should unconditionally single-quote emitted strings (including the name of the command itself being quoted), with {{'\"'\"'}} used for embedded single quotes, for maximum safety across shells implementing a superset of POSIX quoting rules.\n",
