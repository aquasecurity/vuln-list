  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-3974:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. A possible use-after-free vulnerability could allow an attacker to input a specially crafted file leading to a crash or code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3973:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. A possible heap-based buffer overflow could allow an attacker to input a specially crafted file leading to a crash or code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3968:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. A possible heap use-after-free vulnerability could allow an attacker to input a specially crafted file leading to a crash or code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3875:\n\tThere's an out-of-bounds read flaw in Vim's ex_docmd.c. An attacker who is capable of tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file could trigger an out-of-bounds read on a memmove operation, potentially causing an impact to application availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3872:\n\tAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in vim's drawscreen.c win_redr_status() function. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user to open a crafted file with specific arguments in vim, triggering an out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3796:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in vim could allow an attacker to input a specially crafted file leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash or code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3778:\n\tA flaw was found in vim. A possible heap-based buffer overflow could allow an attacker to input a specially crafted file leading to a crash or code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n",
