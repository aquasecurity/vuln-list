  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-47497:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmem: Fix shift-out-of-bound (UBSAN) with byte size cells\n\nCVE-2021-47434:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxhci: Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command\n\nCVE-2021-47425:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: acpi: fix resource leak in reconfiguration device addition\n\nCVE-2021-47418:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: fix NULL deref in fifo_set_limit()\n\nCVE-2021-47416:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: mdio: fix memory leak\n\nCVE-2021-47405:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: usbhid: free raw_report buffers in usbhid_stop\n\nCVE-2021-47404:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: betop: fix slab-out-of-bounds Write in betop_probe\n\nCVE-2021-47397:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: break out if skb_header_pointer returns NULL in sctp_rcv_ootb\n\nCVE-2021-47387:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpufreq: schedutil: Use kobject release() method to free sugov_tunables\n\nCVE-2021-47383:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit\n\nCVE-2021-47375:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblktrace: Fix uaf in blk_trace access after removing by sysfs\n\nCVE-2021-47373:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix potential VPE leak on error\n\nCVE-2021-41864:\n\tAn out-of-bounds (OOB) memory write flaw was found in prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the bpf in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, the multiplication to calculate the size could lead to an integer overflow which could allow a local attacker, with a special user privilege, to gain access to out-of-bounds memory leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2021-38300:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The cBPF JIT compiler may produce machine code with incorrect branches. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to craft anomalous machine code, where the control flow is hijacked to execute arbitrary kernel code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3764:\n\tA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is similar to the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3744:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A memory leak in the ccp-ops crypto driver can allow attackers to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-37159:\n\tA flaw use-after-free in the Linux kernel USB High Speed Mobile Devices functionality was found in the way user detaches USB device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2021-20321:\n\tA race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2021-20317:\n\tA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.\n",
