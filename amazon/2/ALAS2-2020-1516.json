It only allows to abort a session. No data extraction is possible. This has been fixed in 2.0.0.\n1835766: CVE-2020-11048 freerdp: out-of-bounds read could result in aborting the session\n\nCVE-2020-11047:\n\tIn FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in autodetect_recv_bandwidth_measure_results. A malicious server can extract up to 8 bytes of client memory with a manipulated message by providing a short input and reading the measurement result data. This has been patched in 2.0.0.\n1835762: CVE-2020-11047 freerdp: out-of-bounds read in autodetect_recv_bandwidth_measure_results function\n\nCVE-2020-11046:\n\tIn FreeRDP after 1.0 and before 2.0.0, there is a stream out-of-bounds seek in update_read_synchronize that could lead to a later out-of-bounds read.\n1835403: CVE-2020-11046 freerdp: out of bounds seek in update_read_synchronize function could lead out of bounds read\n\nCVE-2020-11045:\n\tIn FreeRDP after 1.0 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read in in update_read_bitmap_data that allows client memory to be read to an image buffer. The result displayed on screen as colour.\n1835399: CVE-2020-11045 freerdp: out of bounds read in update_read_bitmap_data function\n\nCVE-2020-11044:\n\tIn FreeRDP greater than 1.2 and before 2.0.0, a double free in update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order crashes the client application if corrupted data from a manipulated server is parsed. This has been patched in 2.0.0.\n1835391: CVE-2020-11044 freerdp: double free in update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order function\n\nCVE-2020-11043:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in rfx_process_message_tileset. Invalid data fed to RFX decoder results in garbage on screen (as colors). This has been patched in 2.1.0.\n1848038: CVE-2020-11043 freerdp: out of bound read in rfx_process_message_tileset\n\nCVE-2020-11042:\n\tIn FreeRDP greater than 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in update_read_icon_info. It allows reading a attacker-defined amount of client memory (32bit unsigned -\u003e 4GB) to an intermediate buffer. This can be used to crash the client or store information for later retrieval. This has been patched in 2.0.0.\n1835382: CVE-2020-11042 freerdp: out-of-bounds read in update_read_icon_info function\n\nCVE-2020-11041:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an outside controlled array index is used unchecked for data used as configuration for sound backend (alsa, oss, pulse, ...). The most likely outcome is a crash of the client instance followed by no or distorted sound or a session disconnect. If a user cannot upgrade to the patched version, a workaround is to disable sound for the session. This has been patched in 2.1.0.\n1848034: CVE-2020-11041 freerdp: Unchecked read of array offset in rdpsnd_recv_wave2_pdu\n\nCVE-2020-11040:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound data read from memory in clear_decompress_subcode_rlex, visualized on screen as color. This has been patched in 2.1.0.\n1848029: CVE-2020-11040 freerdp: Out of bound access in clear_decompress_subcode_rlex\n\nCVE-2020-11039:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, when using a manipulated server with USB redirection enabled (nearly) arbitrary memory can be read and written due to integer overflows in length checks. This has been patched in 2.1.0.\n1848022: CVE-2020-11039 freerdp: Out of bound read/write in usb redirection channel\n\nCVE-2020-11038:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow exists. When using /video redirection, a manipulated server can instruct the client to allocate a buffer with a smaller size than requested due to an integer overflow in size calculation. With later messages, the server can manipulate the client to write data out of bound to the previously allocated buffer. This has been patched in 2.1.0.\n1848018: CVE-2020-11038 freerdp: Integer overflow in VIDEO channel\n\nCVE-2020-11019:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, when running with logger set to \"WLOG_TRACE\", a possible crash of application could occur due to a read of an invalid array index. Data could be printed as string to local terminal. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.\n1848012: CVE-2020-11019 freerdp: Out of bound read in update_recv could result in a crash\n\nCVE-2020-11018:\n\tIn FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, a possible resource exhaustion vulnerability can be performed. Malicious clients could trigger out of bound reads causing memory allocation with random size. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.\n1848008: CVE-2020-11018 freerdp: Out of bound read in cliprdr_server_receive_capabilities\n",
