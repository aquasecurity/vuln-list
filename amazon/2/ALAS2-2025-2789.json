This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 135, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.20, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.7, Thunderbird \u003c 128.7, and Thunderbird \u003c 135.\n\nCVE-2025-1009:\n\tAn attacker could have caused a use-after-free via crafted XSLT data, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 135, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.20, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.7, Thunderbird \u003c 128.7, and Thunderbird \u003c 135.\n\nCVE-2025-0510:\n\tThunderbird displayed an incorrect sender address if the From field of an email used the invalid group name syntax that is described in CVE-2024-49040. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 128.7 and Thunderbird \u003c 135.\n\nCVE-2025-0242:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 133, Thunderbird 133, Firefox ESR 115.18, Firefox ESR 128.5, Thunderbird 115.18, and Thunderbird 128.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 134, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.6, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.19, Thunderbird \u003c 134, and Thunderbird ESR \u003c 128.6.\n\nCVE-2024-9400:\n\tA potential memory corruption vulnerability could be triggered if an attacker had the ability to trigger an OOM at a specific moment during JIT compilation.
