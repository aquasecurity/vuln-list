  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-47835:\n\tGStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been detected in the parse_lrc function within gstsubparse.c. The parse_lrc function calls strchr() to find the character ']' in the string line. The pointer returned by this call is then passed to g_strdup(). However, if the string line does not contain the character ']', strchr() returns NULL, and a call to g_strdup(start + 1) leads to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n\nCVE-2024-47600:\n\tGStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been detected in the format_channel_mask function in gst-discoverer.c. The vulnerability affects the local array position, which is defined with a fixed size of 64 elements. However, the function gst_discoverer_audio_info_get_channels may return a guint channels value greater than 64. This causes the for loop to attempt access beyond the bounds of the position array, resulting in an OOB-read when an index greater than 63 is used. This vulnerability can result in reading unintended bytes from the stack. Additionally, the dereference of value-\u003evalue_nick after the OOB-read can lead to further memory corruption or undefined behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n\nCVE-2024-47542:\n\tGStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference has been discovered in the id3v2_read_synch_uint function, located in id3v2.c. If id3v2_read_synch_uint is called with a null work-\u003ehdr.frame_data, the pointer guint8 *data is accessed without validation, resulting in a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n\nCVE-2024-47541:\n\tGStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-write vulnerability has been identified in the gst_ssa_parse_remove_override_codes function of the gstssaparse.c file. This function is responsible for parsing and removing SSA (SubStation Alpha) style override codes, which are enclosed in curly brackets ({}). The issue arises when a closing curly bracket \"}\" appears before an opening curly bracket \"{\" in the input string. In this case, memmove() incorrectly duplicates a substring. With each successive loop iteration, the size passed to memmove() becomes progressively larger (strlen(end+1)), leading to a write beyond the allocated memory bounds. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.\n",
