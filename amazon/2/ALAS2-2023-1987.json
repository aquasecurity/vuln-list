An object could potentially extend beyond the end of an allocation.\n\nCVE-2023-3161:\n\tA flaw was found in the Framebuffer Console (fbcon) in the Linux Kernel. When providing a font-\u003ewidth and font-\u003eheight greater than 32 to the fbcon_set_font, since there are no checks in place, a shift-out-of-bounds occurs, leading to undefined behavior and possible denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-2985:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in hfsplus_put_super in fs/hfsplus/super.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local user to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-26545:\n\tIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.13, there is a double free in net/mpls/af_mpls.c upon an allocation failure (for registering the sysctl table under a new location) during the renaming of a device.\n\nCVE-2023-2162:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create in drivers/scsi/iscsi_tcp.c in the SCSI sub-component in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow an attacker to leak kernel internal information.\n\nCVE-2023-1998:\n\tWhen plain IBRS is enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the logic in spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation() determines that STIBP is not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target\ninjection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit is cleared on returning to userspace for performance reasons which leaves userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\nCVE-2023-1829:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28.\n\nCVE-2023-1281:\n\tUse After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root.\nThis issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2.\n\nCVE-2023-0458:\n\tDetected a few exploitable gadgets that could leak secret memory through a side-channel such as MDS as well as insufficient hardening of the usercopy functions against spectre-v1.\n\nCVE-2022-50396:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sched: fix memory leak in tcindex_set_parms\n",
