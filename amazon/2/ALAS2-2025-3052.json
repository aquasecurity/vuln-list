  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-11715:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 140.3, Thunderbird ESR 140.3, Firefox 143 and Thunderbird 143. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2025-11714:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 115.28, Firefox ESR 140.3, Thunderbird ESR 140.3, Firefox 143 and Thunderbird 143. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.29, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2025-11712:\n\tA malicious page could have used the type attribute of an OBJECT tag to override the default browser behavior when encountering a web resource served without a content-type. This could have contributed to an XSS on a site that unsafely serves files without a content-type header. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2025-11711:\n\tThere was a way to change the value of JavaScript Object properties that were supposed to be non-writeable. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.29, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2025-11710:\n\tA compromised web process using malicious IPC messages could have caused the privileged browser process to reveal blocks of its memory to the compromised process. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.29, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2025-11709:\n\tA compromised web process was able to trigger out of bounds reads and writes in a more privileged process using manipulated WebGL textures. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.29, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2025-11708:\n\tUse-after-free in MediaTrackGraphImpl::GetInstance() This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 144, Firefox ESR \u003c 140.4, Thunderbird \u003c 144, and Thunderbird \u003c 140.4.\n\nCVE-2024-5197:\n\tThere exists interger overflows in libvpx in versions prior to 1.14.1. Calling vpx_img_alloc() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned vpx_image_t struct may be invalid. Calling vpx_img_wrap() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or stride_align parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned vpx_image_t struct may be invalid. We recommend upgrading to version 1.14.1 or beyond\n",
