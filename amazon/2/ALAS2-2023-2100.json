  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2024-0775:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in the __ext4_remount in fs/ext4/super.c in ext4 in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local user to cause an information leak problem while freeing the old quota file names before a potential failure, leading to a use-after-free.\n\nCVE-2023-53705:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: Fix out-of-bounds access in ipv6_find_tlv()\n\nCVE-2023-53683:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: hfsplus: remove WARN_ON() from hfsplus_cat_{read,write}_inode()\n\nCVE-2023-53667:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: cdc_ncm: Deal with too low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize\n\nCVE-2023-53604:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm integrity: call kmem_cache_destroy() in dm_integrity_init() error path\n\nCVE-2023-53587:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nring-buffer: Sync IRQ works before buffer destruction\n\nCVE-2023-53569:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next2: Check block size validity during mount\n\nCVE-2023-53489:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with TX timestamp.\n\nCVE-2023-53484:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap-\u003eobj array entries\n\nCVE-2023-53450:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: remove a BUG_ON in ext4_mb_release_group_pa()\n\nCVE-2023-53337:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only\n\nCVE-2023-53299:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid10: fix leak of 'r10bio-\u003eremaining' for recovery\n\nCVE-2023-53285:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: add bounds checking in get_max_inline_xattr_value_size()\n\nCVE-2023-53182:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPICA: Avoid undefined behavior: applying zero offset to null pointer\n\nCVE-2023-53176:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: 8250: Reinit port-\u003epm on port specific driver unbind\n\nCVE-2023-34256:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.3. There is an out-of-bounds read in crc16 in lib/crc16.c when called from fs/ext4/super.c because ext4_group_desc_csum does not properly check an offset.\n\nCVE-2023-3141:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect, possibly leading to a kernel information leak.\n\nCVE-2023-3111:\n\tA use after free vulnerability was found in prepare_to_relocate in fs/btrfs/relocation.c in btrfs in the Linux Kernel. This possible flaw can be triggered by calling btrfs_ioctl_balance() before calling btrfs_ioctl_defrag().\n\nCVE-2023-3090:\n\tA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb-\u003ecb  initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable if CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled.\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e.\n\nCVE-2023-28466:\n\tdo_tls_getsockopt in net/tls/tls_main.c in the Linux kernel through 6.2.6 lacks a lock_sock call, leading to a race condition (with a resultant use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference).\n\nCVE-2023-2269:\n\tA denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component.\n\nCVE-2022-50213:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table\n\nCVE-2022-50067:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: unset reloc control if transaction commit fails in prepare_to_relocate()\n\nCVE-2022-34918:\n\tA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Netfilter subsystem in the way a user provides incorrect input of the NFT_DATA_VERDICT type. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-2586:\n\tIt was discovered that a nft object or expression could reference a nft set on a different nft table, leading to a use-after-free once that table was deleted.\n",
