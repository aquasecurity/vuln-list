  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-29550:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nMozilla developers Andrew Osmond, Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 102.9, Firefox 111, and Firefox ESR 102.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2023-29548:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nA wrong lowering instruction in the ARM64 Ion compiler resulted in a wrong optimization result.\n\nCVE-2023-29541:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nFirefox did not properly handle downloads of files ending in .desktop, which can be interpreted to run attacker-controlled commands.\nThis bug only affects Firefox for Linux on certain Distributions. Other operating systems are unaffected, and Mozilla is unable to enumerate all affected Linux Distributions.\n\nCVE-2023-29539:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nWhen handling the filename directive in the Content-Disposition header, the filename would be truncated if the filename contained a NULL character. This could have led to reflected file download attacks potentially tricking users to install malware.\n\nCVE-2023-29536:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nAn attacker could cause the memory manager to incorrectly free a pointer that addresses attacker-controlled memory, resulting in an assertion, memory corruption, or a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-29535:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nFollowing a Garbage Collector compaction, weak maps may have been accessed before they were correctly traced. This resulted in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-29533:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nA website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a combination of window.open, fullscreen requests, window.name assignments, and setInterval calls. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2023-29479:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nCertain malformed OpenPGP messages could trigger incorrect parsing of PKESK/SKESK packets due to a bug in the Ribose RNP library used by Thunderbird up to version 102.9.1, which would cause the Thunderbird user interface to hang. The issue was discovered using Google's oss-fuzz.\n\nCVE-2023-1945:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nUnexpected data returned from the Safe Browsing API could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-0547:\n\tThe Mozilla Foundation describes this issue as follows:\nOCSP revocation status of recipient certificates was not checked when sending S/Mime encrypted email, and revoked certificates would be accepted. Thunderbird versions from 68 to 102.9.1 were affected by this bug.\n",
