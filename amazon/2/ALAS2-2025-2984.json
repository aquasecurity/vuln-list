  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-7546:\n\tA vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in GNU Binutils 2.45. Affected by this issue is the function bfd_elf_set_group_contents of the file bfd/elf.c. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds write. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is 41461010eb7c79fee7a9d5f6209accdaac66cc6b. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.\n\nCVE-2025-7545:\n\tA vulnerability classified as problematic was found in GNU Binutils 2.45. Affected by this vulnerability is the function copy_section of the file binutils/objcopy.c. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named 08c3cbe5926e4d355b5cb70bbec2b1eeb40c2944. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.\n\nCVE-2025-47907:\n\tCancelling a query (e.g. by cancelling the context passed to one of the query methods) during a call to the Scan method of the returned Rows can result in unexpected results if other queries are being made in parallel. This can result in a race condition that may overwrite the expected results with those of another query, causing the call to Scan to return either unexpected results from the other query or an error.\n\nCVE-2025-47906:\n\tos/exec: LookPath may return unexpected paths. If the PATH environment variable contains paths which are executables (rather than just directories), passing certain strings to LookPath (\"\", \".\", and \"..\"), can result in the binaries listed in the PATH being unexpectedly returned.\n",
