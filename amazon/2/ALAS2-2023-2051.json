  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-32215:\n\tMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 112 and Firefox ESR 102.10.

These could have led to potential user confusion and spoofing attacks.\n",
