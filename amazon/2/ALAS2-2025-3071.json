  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-61725:\n\tnet/mail: excessive CPU consumption in ParseAddress\n\nThe ParseAddress function constructed domain-literal address components through repeated string concatenation. When parsing large domain-literal components, this could cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\nCVE-2025-61723:\n\tencoding/pem: quadratic complexity when parsing some invalid inputs\n\nDue to the design of the PEM parsing function, the processing time for some\ninputs scales non-linearly with respect to the size of the input.\n\nThis affects programs which parse untrusted PEM inputs.\n\nCVE-2025-58188:\n\tcrypto/x509: panic when validating certificates with DSA public keys\n\nValidating certificate chains which contain DSA public keys can cause programs\nto panic, due to a interface cast that assumes they implement the Equal method.\n\nThis affects programs which validate arbitrary certificate chains.\n\nCVE-2025-58186:\n\tnet/http: lack of limit when parsing cookies can cause memory exhaustion\n\nDespite HTTP headers having a default limit of 1 MB, the number of cookies that can be parsed did not have a limit.\nBy sending a lot of very small cookies such as \"a=;\", an attacker can make an HTTP server allocate a large amount of structs, causing large memory consumption.\n\nnet/http now limits the number of cookies accepted to 3000, which can be adjusted using the httpcookiemaxnum GODEBUG option.\n\nCVE-2025-58185:\n\tencoding/asn1: pre-allocating memory when parsing DER payload can cause memory exhaustion\n\nWhen parsing DER payloads, memories were being allocated prior to fully validating the payloads.\nThis permits an attacker to craft a big empty DER payload to cause memory exhaustion in functions such as asn1.Unmarshal, x509.ParseCertificateRequest, and ocsp.ParseResponse.\n\nCVE-2025-58183:\n\tarchive/tar: unbounded allocation when parsing GNU sparse map\n\ntar.Reader did not set a maximum size on the number of sparse region data blocks in GNU tar pax 1.0 sparse files. A maliciously-crafted archive containing a large number of sparse regions could cause a Reader to read an unbounded amount of data from the archive into memory. When reading from a compressed source, a small compressed input could result in large allocations.\n",
