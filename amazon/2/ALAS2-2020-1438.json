  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-7418:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.12 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.4, the SIGCOMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-sigcomp.c by correcting the extraction of the length value.\n1549305: CVE-2018-7418 wireshark: SIGCOMP dissector crash in packet-sigcomp.c\n\nCVE-2018-19622:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the MMSE dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mmse.c by preventing length overflows.\n1655932: CVE-2018-19622 wireshark: Infinite loop in the MMSE dissector\n\nCVE-2018-16057:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.2, 2.4.0 to 2.4.8, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.16, the Radiotap dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ieee80211-radiotap-iter.c by validating iterator operations.\n1625925: CVE-2018-16057 wireshark: Radiotap dissector crash\n\nCVE-2018-14368:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the Bazaar protocol dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bzr.c by properly handling items that are too long.\n1607327: CVE-2018-14368 wireshark: Bazaar dissector infinite loop (wnpa-sec-2018-40)\n\nCVE-2018-14341:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the DICOM dissector could go into a large or infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c by preventing an offset overflow.\n1607326: CVE-2018-14341 wireshark: DICOM dissector infinite loop (wnpa-sec-2018-39)\n\nCVE-2018-14340:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, dissectors that support zlib decompression could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbuff_zlib.c by rejecting negative lengths to avoid a buffer over-read.\n1607323: CVE-2018-14340 wireshark: Multiple dissectors could crash (wnpa-sec-2018-36)\n\nCVE-2018-11362:\n\tIn Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the LDSS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ldss.c by avoiding a buffer over-read upon encountering a missing '\\0' character.\n1581787: CVE-2018-11362 wireshark: Out-of-bounds read in packet-ldss.c\n",
