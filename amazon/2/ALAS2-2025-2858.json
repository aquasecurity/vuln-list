  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-4093:\n\tMemory safety bug present in Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-4091:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 137, Thunderbird 137, Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10, Thunderbird \u003c 138, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-4087:\n\tA vulnerability was identified in Thunderbird where XPath parsing could trigger undefined behavior due to missing null checks during attribute access. This could lead to out-of-bounds read access and potentially, memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10, Thunderbird \u003c 138, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-4083:\n\tA process isolation vulnerability in Firefox stemmed from improper handling of javascript: URIs, which could allow content to execute in the top-level document's process instead of the intended frame, potentially enabling a sandbox escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.23, Thunderbird \u003c 138, and Thunderbird ESR \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-3523:\n\tWhen an email contains multiple attachments with external links via the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header, only the last link is shown when hovering over any attachment. Although the correct link is used on click, the misleading hover text could trick users into downloading content from untrusted sources. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 137.0.2 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.9.2.\n\nCVE-2025-3522:\n\tThunderbird processes the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header to handle attachments which can be hosted externally. When an email is opened, Thunderbird accesses the specified URL to  determine file size, and navigates to it when the user clicks the attachment. Because the URL is not validated or sanitized, it can reference internal resources like chrome:// or SMB share file:// links, potentially leading to hashed Windows credential leakage and opening the door to more serious security issues. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 137.0.2 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.9.2.\n\nCVE-2025-29088:\n\tAn issue in sqlite v.3.49.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_LOOKASIDE component\n\nCVE-2025-2830:\n\tBy crafting a malformed file name for an attachment in a multipart message, an attacker can trick Thunderbird into including a directory listing of /tmp when the message is forwarded or edited as a new message. This vulnerability could allow attackers to disclose sensitive information from the victim's system. This vulnerability is not limited to Linux; similar behavior has been observed on Windows as well. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 137.0.2 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.9.2.\n\nCVE-2022-45404:\n\tThrough a series of popup and \u003ccode\u003ewindow.print()\u003c/code\u003e calls, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 102.5, Thunderbird \u003c 102.5, and Firefox \u003c 107.\n",
