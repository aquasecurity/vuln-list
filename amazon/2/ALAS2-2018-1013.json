  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-1100:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell check path functionality. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted message file, which, if used to set a custom \u0026quot;you have new mail\u0026quot; message, leads to code execution in the context of the user who receives the message. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.\n1563395: \nCVE-2018-1100 zsh: buffer overflow in utils.c:checkmailpath() can lead to local arbitrary code execution\n\nCVE-2018-1083:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell auto-complete functionality. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which leads to code execution in the context of the user who tries to use auto-complete to traverse the before mentioned path. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.\n1557382: \nCVE-2018-1083 zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in gen_matches_files() at compctl.c\n\nCVE-2018-1071:\n\tzsh through version 5.4.2 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow in the exec.c:hashcmd() function. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.\n1553531: \nCVE-2018-1071 zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in exec.c:hashcmd()\n",
