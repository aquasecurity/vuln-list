  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2018-1126:\n\tA flaw was found where procps-ng provides wrappers for standard C allocators that took `unsigned int` instead of `size_t` parameters. On platforms where these differ (such as x86_64), this could cause integer truncation, leading to undersized regions being returned to callers that could then be overflowed. The only known exploitable vector for this issue is CVE-2018-1124.\n1575853: \nCVE-2018-1126 procps-ng, procps: incorrect integer size in proc/alloc.* leading to truncation / integer overflow issues\n\nCVE-2018-1124:\n\tMultiple integer overflows leading to heap corruption flaws were discovered in file2strvec(). These vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation for a local attacker who can create entries in procfs by starting processes, which will lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution in proc utilities run by other users (eg pgrep, pkill, pidof, w).\n1575465: \nCVE-2018-1124 procps-ng, procps: Integer overflows leading to heap overflow in file2strvec\n",
