With root access, an attacker can trigger a race condition that results in a fill_kobj_path out-of-bounds write.\n\nCVE-2023-2985:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in hfsplus_put_super in fs/hfsplus/super.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local user to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-1998:\n\tWhen plain IBRS is enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the logic in spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation() determines that STIBP is not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target\ninjection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit is cleared on returning to userspace for performance reasons which leaves userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\nCVE-2023-1829:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28.\n\nCVE-2023-1118:\n\tA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1077:\n\tkernel: Type confusion in pick_next_rt_entity(), which can result in memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1076:\n\tDue to a type confusion during initializations, the tun and tap sockets in the Linux Kernel have their socket UID hardcoded to 0, i.e. root. While it will be often correct, as TUN/TAP devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case. The socket UID may be used for network filtering and routing, thus TUN/TAP sockets may be incorrectly managed, potentially bypassing network filters based on UID.\n\nCVE-2023-1032:\n\tA double-free vulnerability was found in the handling of IORING_OP_SOCKET operation with io_uring on the Linux kernel.\n",
