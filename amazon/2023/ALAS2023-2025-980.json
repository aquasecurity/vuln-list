  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-22872:\n\tThe tokenizer incorrectly interprets tags with unquoted attribute values that end with a solidus character (/) as self-closing. When directly using Tokenizer, this can result in such tags incorrectly being marked as self-closing, and when using the Parse functions, this can result in content following such tags as being placed in the wrong scope during DOM construction, but only when tags are in foreign content (e.g. \u003cmath\u003e, \u003csvg\u003e, etc contexts).\n\nCVE-2025-22871:\n\tThe net/http package accepted data in the chunked transfer encoding containing an invalid chunk-size line terminated by a bare LF. When used in conjunction with a server or proxy which incorrectly interprets a bare LF in a chunk extension as part of the extension, this could permit request smuggling.\n",
