  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-8556:\n\tA flaw was found in CIRCL's implementation of the FourQ elliptic curve. This vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise session security via low-order point injection and incorrect point validation during Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nCVE-2025-61729:\n\tWithin HostnameError.Error(), when constructing an error string, there is no limit to the number of hosts that will be printed out. Furthermore, the error string is constructed by repeated string concatenation, leading to quadratic runtime. Therefore, a certificate provided by a malicious actor can result in excessive resource consumption.\n\nCVE-2025-61727:\n\tcrypto/x509: excluded subdomain constraint does not restrict wildcard SANs\n\nAn excluded subdomain constraint in a certificate chain does not restrict the usage of wildcard SANs in the leaf certificate. For example a constraint that excludes the subdomain test.example.com does not prevent a leaf certificate from claiming the SAN *.example.com.\n\nCVE-2025-61725:\n\tnet/mail: excessive CPU consumption in ParseAddress\n\nThe ParseAddress function constructed domain-literal address components through repeated string concatenation. When parsing large domain-literal components, this could cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\nCVE-2025-61724:\n\tnet/textproto: excessive CPU consumption in Reader.ReadResponse\n\nThe Reader.ReadResponse function constructed a response string through\nrepeated string concatenation of lines. When the number of lines in a response is large,\nthis could cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\nCVE-2025-61723:\n\tencoding/pem: quadratic complexity when parsing some invalid inputs\n\nDue to the design of the PEM parsing function, the processing time for some\ninputs scales non-linearly with respect to the size of the input.\n\nThis affects programs which parse untrusted PEM inputs.\n\nCVE-2025-58189:\n\tcrypto/tls: ALPN negotiation errors can contain arbitrary text\n\nThe crypto/tls conn.Handshake method returns an error on the server-side when ALPN negotation fails which can contain arbitrary attacker controlled information provided by the client-side of the connection which is not escaped.\n\nThis affects programs which log these errors without any additional form of sanitization, and may allow injection of attacker controlled information into logs.\n\nCVE-2025-58188:\n\tcrypto/x509: panic when validating certificates with DSA public keys\n\nValidating certificate chains which contain DSA public keys can cause programs\nto panic, due to a interface cast that assumes they implement the Equal method.\n\nThis affects programs which validate arbitrary certificate chains.\n\nCVE-2025-58187:\n\tcrypto/x509: quadratic complexity when checking name constraints\n\nDue to the design of the name constraint checking algorithm, the processing time\nof some inputs scales non-linearly with respect to the size of the certificate.\n\nThis affects programs which validate arbitrary certificate chains.\n\nCVE-2025-58186:\n\tnet/http: lack of limit when parsing cookies can cause memory exhaustion\n\nDespite HTTP headers having a default limit of 1 MB, the number of cookies that can be parsed did not have a limit.\nBy sending a lot of very small cookies such as \"a=;\", an attacker can make an HTTP server allocate a large amount of structs, causing large memory consumption.\n\nnet/http now limits the number of cookies accepted to 3000, which can be adjusted using the httpcookiemaxnum GODEBUG option.\n\nCVE-2025-58185:\n\tencoding/asn1: pre-allocating memory when parsing DER payload can cause memory exhaustion\n\nWhen parsing DER payloads, memories were being allocated prior to fully validating the payloads.\nThis permits an attacker to craft a big empty DER payload to cause memory exhaustion in functions such as asn1.Unmarshal, x509.ParseCertificateRequest, and ocsp.ParseResponse.\n\nCVE-2025-58183:\n\tarchive/tar: unbounded allocation when parsing GNU sparse map\n\ntar.Reader did not set a maximum size on the number of sparse region data blocks in GNU tar pax 1.0 sparse files. A maliciously-crafted archive containing a large number of sparse regions could cause a Reader to read an unbounded amount of data from the archive into memory. When reading from a compressed source, a small compressed input could result in large allocations.\n\nCVE-2025-47912:\n\tnet/url: insufficient validation of bracketed IPv6 hostnames\n\nThe Parse function permitted values other than IPv6 addresses to be included in square brackets within the host component of a URL. RFC 3986 permits IPv6 addresses to be included within the host component, enclosed within square brackets. For example: \"http://[::1]/\". IPv4 addresses and hostnames must not appear within square brackets. Parse did not enforce this requirement.\n\nCVE-2025-4673:\n\tProxy-Authorization and Proxy-Authenticate headers persisted on cross-origin redirects potentially leaking sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2025-22874:\n\tCalling Verify with a VerifyOptions.KeyUsages that contains ExtKeyUsageAny unintentionally disabledpolicy validation. This only affected certificate chains which contain policy graphs, which are rather uncommon.\n",
