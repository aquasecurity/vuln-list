  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-46848:\n\tThis problem allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service when sending ftp:// URLs in HTTP Request messages or constructing ftp:// URLs from FTP Native input.\n\nThis issue is triggered during access control security checks, meaning clients may not have been permitted to use the proxy yet.\n\nFTP support is always enabled and cannot be disabled completely.\n\nCVE-2023-46846:\n\tDue to chunked decoder lenience Squid is vulnerable to Request/Response smuggling attacks when parsing HTTP/1.1 and ICAP messages.\n\nCVE-2023-46728:\n\tSquid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Squid's Gopher gateway. The gopher protocol is always available and enabled in Squid prior to Squid 6.0.1. Responses triggering this bug are possible to be received from any gopher server, even those without malicious intent. Gopher support has been removed in Squid version 6.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reject all gopher URL requests.\n\nCVE-2023-46724:\n\tSquid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.\n",
