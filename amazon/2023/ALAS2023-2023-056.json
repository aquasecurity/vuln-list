  "severity": "Important",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-24801:\n\tA flaw was found in python-twisted. This vulnerability occurs due to the parsing of illegal constructs in the twisted.web.http module. The illegal constructs include '+/-' in the Content-Length header, '\\n and \\t' etc. Non-conformant parsing leads to a desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers. This flaw allows a remote attacker to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack.\n\nCVE-2022-21716:\n\tAn uncontrolled resource consumption flaw was found in python-twisted in the dataReceived() function. This flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a simple command to use all available memory and crash the server.\n\nCVE-2022-21712:\n\tA flaw was found in the twisted Python library when WebClient redirects via the RedirectAgent and BrowserLikeRedirectAgent methods. This flaw allows an attacker to take advantage of these cross-origin redirects and leak the cookie and authorization headers.\n",
