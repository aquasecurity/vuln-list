  "severity": "Medium",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2023-4535:\n\tOut-of-bounds read in MyEID driver handling encryption using symmetric keys\n\nThis issue require physical access to the computer running opensc and crafted USB device or smart card that would present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs so they are considered a high-complexity and low-severity.\n\nThis issue is in the code handling symmetric keys, which are not widely used for example for desktop login so most of the deployments are not affected.\n\nCVE-2023-40661:\n\tmultiple memory issues with pkcs15-init (enrollment tool)\n\nCVE-2023-40660:\n\tPotential PIN bypass.\nWhen the token/card was plugged into the computer and authenticated from one process, it could be used to provide cryptographic operations from different process when the empty, zero-length PIN and the token can track the login status using some of its internals. This is dangerous for OS logon/screen unlock and small tokens that are plugged permanently to the computer.\n",
