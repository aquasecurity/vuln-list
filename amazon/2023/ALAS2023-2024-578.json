  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-54574:\n\tSquid is a caching proxy for the Web. In versions 6.3 and below, Squid is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow and possible remote code execution attack when processing URN due to incorrect buffer management. This has been fixed in version 6.4. To work around this issue, disable URN access permissions.\n\nCVE-2024-25111:\n\tSquid is a web proxy cache. Starting in version 3.5.27 and prior to version 6.8, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Chunked decoder due to an uncontrolled recursion bug. This problem allows a remote attacker to cause Denial of Service when sending a crafted, chunked, encoded HTTP Message. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.8. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. There is no workaround for this issue.\n\nCVE-2024-23638:\n\tSquid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer reference bug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Cache Manager error responses. This problem allows a trusted client to perform Denial of Service when generating error pages for Client Manager reports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have not been tested and should be assumed to be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround, prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control: `http_access deny manager`.\n\nCVE-2023-5824:\n\tSQUID-2023:2 Multiple issues in HTTP response caching\n\nCVE-2023-49288:\n\tSquid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Affected versions of squid are subject to a a Use-After-Free bug which can lead to a Denial of Service attack via collapsed forwarding. All versions of Squid from 3.5 up to and including 5.9 configured with \"collapsed_forwarding on\" are vulnerable. Configurations with \"collapsed_forwarding off\" or without a \"collapsed_forwarding\" directive are not vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should remove all collapsed_forwarding lines from their squid.conf.\n\nCVE-2023-49285:\n\tSquid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a Buffer Overread bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Squid HTTP Message processing. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
