missing IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro for ip_set_hash_netportnet.c\n\nCVE-2023-52886:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix race by not overwriting udev-\u003edescriptor in hub_port_init()\n\nCVE-2023-52628:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write\n\nIf priv-\u003elen is a multiple of 4, then dst[len / 4] can write past\nthe destination array which leads to stack corruption.\n\nThis construct is necessary to clean the remainder of the register\nin case -\u003elen is NOT a multiple of the register size, so make it\nconditional just like nft_payload.c does.\n\nThe bug was added in 4.1 cycle and then copied/inherited when\ntcp/sctp and ip option support was added.\n\nBug reported by Zero Day Initiative project (ZDI-CAN-21950,\nZDI-CAN-21951, ZDI-CAN-21961).\n\nCVE-2023-4921:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nWhen the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue().\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.\n\nCVE-2023-4623:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nIf a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.\n\nCVE-2023-45871:\n\tAn issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.\n\nCVE-2023-42755:\n\tA flaw was found in rsvp_change(). The root cause is an slab-out-of-bound access, but since the offset to the original pointer is an `unsign int` fully controlled by users, the behavior is usually a wild pointer access.\n\nCVE-2023-42753:\n\tThe upstream commit describes this issue as follows:\n\nThe missing IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro in ip_set_hash_netportnet can lead to the use of wrong `CIDR_POS(c)` for calculating array offsets, which can lead to integer underflow. As a result, it leads to slab out-of-bound access.\n\nCVE-2023-42752:\n\tAn integer overflow in kmalloc_reserve() in the Linux kernel may allow a local user to crash the system, or in some cases obtain code execution in kernel space.\n\nCVE-2023-39193:\n\tA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The sctp_mt_check did not validate the flag_count field. This flaw allows a local privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-39192:\n\tA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-39189:\n\tnftables out-of-bounds read in nf_osf_match_one()\n\nCVE-2023-37453:\n\tAn issue was discovered in the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel through 6.4.2. There is an out-of-bounds and crash in read_descriptors in drivers/usb/core/sysfs.c.\n",
