  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-4093:\n\tMemory safety bug present in Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10 and Thunderbird \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-4091:\n\tMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 137, Thunderbird 137, Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10, Thunderbird \u003c 138, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-4087:\n\tA vulnerability was identified in Thunderbird where XPath parsing could trigger undefined behavior due to missing null checks during attribute access. This could lead to out-of-bounds read access and potentially, memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10, Thunderbird \u003c 138, and Thunderbird \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-4083:\n\tA process isolation vulnerability in Firefox stemmed from improper handling of javascript: URIs, which could allow content to execute in the top-level document's process instead of the intended frame, potentially enabling a sandbox escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 138, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.10, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.23, Thunderbird \u003c 138, and Thunderbird ESR \u003c 128.10.\n\nCVE-2025-29088:\n\tAn issue in sqlite v.3.49.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_LOOKASIDE component\n",
