  "severity": "Important",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-46421:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. When libsoup clients encounter an HTTP redirect, they mistakenly send the HTTP Authorization header to the new host that the redirection points to. This allows the new host to impersonate the user to the original host that issued the redirect.\n\nCVE-2025-46420:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. It is vulnerable to memory leaks in the soup_header_parse_quality_list() function when parsing a quality list that contains elements with all zeroes.\n\nCVE-2025-32913:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() function is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows a malicious HTTP peer to crash a libsoup client or server that uses this function.\n\nCVE-2025-32912:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where SoupAuthDigest is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. The HTTP server may cause the libsoup client to crash.\n\nCVE-2025-32911:\n\tlibsoup: Double free on  soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() through  \"soup-message-headers.c\" via \"params\" GHashTable value\n\nCVE-2025-32910:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where soup_auth_digest_authenticate() is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This issue may cause the libsoup client to crash.\n\nCVE-2025-32909:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. SoupContentSniffer may be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the sniff_mp4 function. The HTTP server may cause the libsoup client to crash.\n\nCVE-2025-32906:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_headers_parse_request() function may be vulnerable to an out-of-bound read. This flaw allows a malicious user to use a specially crafted HTTP request to crash the HTTP server.\n\nCVE-2025-32053:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. A vulnerability in sniff_feed_or_html() and skip_insignificant_space() functions may lead to a heap buffer over-read.\n\nCVE-2025-32052:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. A vulnerability in the sniff_unknown() function may lead to heap buffer over-read.\n\nCVE-2025-32051:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The libsoup soup_uri_decode_data_uri() function may crash when processing malformed data URI. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS).\n\nCVE-2025-32050:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The libsoup append_param_quoted() function may contain an overflow bug resulting in a buffer under-read.\n\nCVE-2025-2784:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The package is vulnerable to a heap buffer over-read when sniffing content via the skip_insight_whitespace() function. Libsoup clients may read one byte out-of-bounds in response to a crafted HTTP response by an HTTP server.\n",
