  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-32913:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() function is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows a malicious HTTP peer to crash a libsoup client or server that uses this function.\n\nCVE-2025-32912:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where SoupAuthDigest is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. The HTTP server may cause the libsoup client to crash.\n\nCVE-2025-32911:\n\tlibsoup: Double free on  soup_message_headers_get_content_disposition() through  \"soup-message-headers.c\" via \"params\" GHashTable value\n\nCVE-2025-32910:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where soup_auth_digest_authenticate() is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This issue may cause the libsoup client to crash.\n\nCVE-2025-32909:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. SoupContentSniffer may be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the sniff_mp4 function. The HTTP server may cause the libsoup client to crash.\n\nCVE-2025-32906:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup, where the soup_headers_parse_request() function may be vulnerable to an out-of-bound read. This flaw allows a malicious user to use a specially crafted HTTP request to crash the HTTP server.\n\nCVE-2025-32053:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. A vulnerability in sniff_feed_or_html() and skip_insignificant_space() functions may lead to a heap buffer over-read.\n\nCVE-2025-32052:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. A vulnerability in the sniff_unknown() function may lead to heap buffer over-read.\n\nCVE-2025-32051:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The libsoup soup_uri_decode_data_uri() function may crash when processing malformed data URI. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS).\n\nCVE-2025-32050:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The libsoup append_param_quoted() function may contain an overflow bug resulting in a buffer under-read.\n\nCVE-2025-2784:\n\tA flaw was found in libsoup. The package is vulnerable to a heap buffer over-read when sniffing content via the skip_insight_whitespace() function. Libsoup clients may read one byte out-of-bounds in response to a crafted HTTP response by an HTTP server.\n",
