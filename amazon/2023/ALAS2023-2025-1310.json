  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2025-4969:\n\tA vulnerability was found in the libsoup package. This flaw stems from its failure to correctly verify the termination of multipart HTTP messages. This can allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted multipart HTTP body, causing the libsoup-consuming server to read beyond its allocated memory boundaries (out-of-bounds read).\n\nCVE-2025-4945:\n\tA flaw was found in the cookie parsing logic of the libsoup HTTP library, used in GNOME applications and other software. The vulnerability arises when processing the expiration date of cookies, where a specially crafted value can trigger an integer overflow. This may result in undefined behavior, allowing an attacker to bypass cookie expiration logic, causing persistent or unintended cookie behavior. The issue stems from improper validation of large integer inputs during date arithmetic operations within the cookie parsing routines.\n\nCVE-2025-4476:\n\tA denial-of-service vulnerability has been identified in the libsoup HTTP client library. This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response containing a specifically crafted domain parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing this malformed header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An attacker could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a user's application using the vulnerable libsoup library connects to this malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service. Successful exploitation requires tricking a user's client application into connecting to the attacker's malicious server.\n",
