reported a warning of netns tracker [0] followed by KASAN splat [1] and another ref tracker warning [1]. syzkaller could not find a repro, but in the log, the only suspicious sequence was as follows: 18:26:22 executing program 1: r0 = socket$inet6_mptcp(0xa, 0x1, 0x106) ... connect$inet6(r0, \u0026(0x7f0000000080)={0xa, 0x4001, 0x0, @loopback}, 0x1c) (async) The notable thing here is 0x4001 in connect(), which is RDS_TCP_PORT.\n\nCVE-2024-26864:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: Fix refcnt handling in __inet_hash_connect().\n\nCVE-2024-26863:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhsr: Fix uninit-value access in hsr_get_node()\n\nCVE-2024-26862:\n\tIn the Linux

resolved:\n\nwireguard: receive: annotate data-race around receiving_counter.counter\n\nCVE-2024-26860:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-integrity: fix a memory leak when rechecking the data\n\nCVE-2024-26816:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86, relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section\n\nCVE-2024-26815:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: taprio: proper TCA_TAPRIO_TC_ENTRY_INDEX check\n\nCVE-2024-26812:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler\n\nCVE-2024-26810:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/pci: Lock external INTx masking ops\n\nCVE-2024-26809:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_set_pipapo: release elements in clone only from destroy path\n\nCVE-2024-26643:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout\n\nCVE-2024-26642:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: disallow anonymous set with timeout flag\n\nCVE-2024-26585:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: fix race between tx work scheduling and socket close\n\nSimilarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg)\nmay exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete().\nReorder scheduling the work before calling complete().\nThis seems more logical in the first place, as it's\nthe inverse order of what the submitting thread will do.\n\nCVE-2024-26584:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests\n\nSince we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our\nrequests to the crypto API, crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return\n -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when\nthe cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an\nartificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued\nto the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback\nwill also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it\nseems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.\n\nCompared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new\ntls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to\nEINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling\npaths. The handling is identical.\n\nCVE-2024-25742:\n\tA malicious hypervisor can potentially break confidentiality and integrity of Linux SEV-SNP guests by injecting interrupts.\n\nCVE-2024-23307:\n\tInteger Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability in Linux kernel on x86 and ARM (md, raid, raid5 modules) allows Forced Integer Overflow.\n\nCVE-2023-53151:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes\n\nCVE-2023-52656:\n\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: drop any code related to SCM_RIGHTS\n",
