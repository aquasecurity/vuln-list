  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2023 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-29599:\n\torg.apache.maven.shared:maven-shared-utils is a functional replacement for plexus-utils in Maven. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection. The Commandline class can emit double-quoted strings without proper escaping, allowing shell injection attacks. The BourneShell class should unconditionally single-quote emitted strings (including the name of the command itself being quoted), with {{\\'\"\\'\"\\'}} used for embedded single quotes, for maximum safety across shells implementing a superset of POSIX quoting rules.\n",
