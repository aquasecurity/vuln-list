Delve should be easy to invoke and easy to use. Chances are if you're using a debugger, things aren't going your way. With that in mind, Delve should stay out of your way as much as possible.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* net/http: Request smuggling due to acceptance of invalid chunked data in net/http (CVE-2025-22871)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
