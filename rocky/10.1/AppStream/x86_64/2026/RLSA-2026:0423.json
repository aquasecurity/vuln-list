  "description": "Libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.  libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who want it), but the SOAP parts were removed long ago.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* libsoup: libsoup: Duplicate Host Header Handling Causes Host-Parsing Discrepancy (First- vs Last-Value Wins) (CVE-2025-14523)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
