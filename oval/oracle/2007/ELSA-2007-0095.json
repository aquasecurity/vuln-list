  "Description": "[1.3.4-46]\n - fix bug ID in changelog\n \n [1.3.4-45]\n - add preliminary patch to fix buffer overflow in krb5kdc and kadmind\n   (#231528, CVE-2007-0957)\n - add preliminary patch to fix double-free in kadmind (#231537, CVE-2007-1216)\n \n [1.3.4-44]\n - temporarily disable bug fixes for #143289, #179062, #180671, #202191, #223669\n   for security update\n - add preliminary patch to correct unauthorized access via krb5-aware telnet\n   daemon (#229782, CVE-2007-0956)\n \n [1.3.4-43]\n - re-enable fixes for #143289, #223669 and rebuild\n \n [1.3.4-42]\n - temporarily back out fixes for #143289, #223669 and rebuild\n \n [1.3.4-41]\n - update rcp non-fatal error patch to fix hangs on write errors, too (Jose\n   Plans, #223669)\n \n [1.3.4-40]\n - report a non-fatal error to the remote rcp when the client fails to open a\n   file for writing (#223669)\n \n [1.3.4-39]\n - refrain from killing any lingering members of our child's process group when\n   logging that the child process has exited (Jose Plans, #143289)\n \n [1.3.4-38]\n - correct syntax error in krb5-config.sh\n \n [1.3.4-37]\n - update to revised upstream patches for CVE-2006-3083 and CVE-2006-3084\n   (MITKRB5-SA-2006-001) to avoid unnecessary error messages from ksu (#209512)\n \n [1.3.4-36]\n - add missing shebang headers to krsh and krlogin wrapper scripts (#209238)\n \n [1.3.4-35]\n - backport changes to make krb5-devel multilib-safe (#202191, prereq for\n \n [1.3.4-34]\n - reapply changes for #198633, #179062, #180671\n \n [1.3.4-33]\n - temporarily revert changes for #198633\n \n [ 1.3.4-32]\n - rebuild\n \n [1.3.4-31]\n - temporarily revert changes for #179062\n - temporarily revert changes for #180671\n - apply patch to fix unchecked calls to setuid() (CVE-2006-3083) and\n   seteuid() (CVE-2006-3084) (#197818)\n \n [1.3.4-30]\n - incorporate fixes for hangs in the rsh client and server (#198633)\n \n [1.3.4-29]\n - if we fail to determine the name of a master KDC in\n   krb5_get_init_creds_keytab(), return the error we got from the non-master\n   rather than the can't-determine-the-name error, which isn't so useful,\n   matching the current release's behavior (#180671)\n \n [1.3.4-28]\n - reenable the fix for #179062",
