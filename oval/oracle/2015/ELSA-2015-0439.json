  "Title": "ELSA-2015-0439:  krb5 security, bug fix and enhancement update (MODERATE)",
  "Description": "[1.12.2-14]\n- fix for kinit -C loops (#1184629, MIT/krb5 issue 243, 'Do not\n  loop on principal unknown errors').\n\n[1.12.2-13]\n- fix for CVE-2014-5352 (#1179856) 'gss_process_context_token()\n  incorrectly frees context (MITKRB5-SA-2015-001)'\n- fix for CVE-2014-9421 (#1179857) 'kadmind doubly frees partial\n  deserialization results (MITKRB5-SA-2015-001)'\n- fix for CVE-2014-9422 (#1179861) 'kadmind incorrectly\n  validates server principal name (MITKRB5-SA-2015-001)'\n- fix for CVE-2014-9423 (#1179863) 'libgssrpc server applications\n  leak uninitialized bytes (MITKRB5-SA-2015-001)'\n\n[1.12.2-12]\n- fix for CVE-2014-5354 (#1174546) 'krb5: NULL pointer\n  dereference when using keyless entries'\n\n[1.12.2-11]\n- fix for CVE-2014-5353 (#1174543) 'Fix LDAP misused policy\n  name crash'\n\n[1.12.2-10]\n- In ksu, without the -e flag, also check .k5users (#1105489)\n  When ksu was explicitly told to spawn a shell, a line in .k5users which\n  listed '*' as the allowed command would cause the principal named on the\n  line to be considered as a candidate for authentication.\n  When ksu was not passed a command to run, which implicitly meant that\n  the invoking user wanted to run the target user's login shell, knowledge\n  that the principal was a valid candidate was ignored, which could cause\n  a less optimal choice of the default target principal.\n  This doesn't impact the authorization checks which we perform later.\n  Patch by Nalin Dahyabhai \u003cnalin@redhat.com\u003e\n\n[1.12.2-9]\n- Undo libkadmclnt SONAME change (from 8 to 9) which originally\n  happened in the krb5 1.12 rebase (#1166012) but broke\n  rubygem-rkerberos (sort of ruby language bindings for\n  libkadmclnt\u0026co.) dependicies, as side effect of\n  rubygem-rkerberos using private interfaces in libkadmclnt.\n\n[1.12.2-8]\n- fix the problem where the %license file has been a dangling symlink\n- ksu: pull in fix from pull #206 to avoid breakage when the\n  default_ccache_name doesn't include a cache type as a prefix\n- ksu: pull in a proposed fix for pull #207 to avoid breakage when the\n  invoking user doesn't already have a ccache\n\n[1.12.2-7]\n- pull in patch from master to load plugins with RTLD_NODELETE, when\n  defined (RT#7947)\n\n[1.12.2-6]\n- backport patch to make the client skip checking the server's reply\n  address when processing responses to password-change requests, which\n  between NAT and upcoming HTTPS support, can cause us to erroneously\n  report an error to the user when the server actually reported success\n  (RT#7886)\n- backport support for accessing KDCs and kpasswd services via HTTPS\n  proxies (marked by being specified as https URIs instead as hostnames\n  or hostname-and-port), such as the one implemented in python-kdcproxy\n  (RT#7929, #109919), and pick up a subsequent patch to build HTTPS\n  as a plugin\n\n[1.12.2-5]\n- backport fix for trying all compatible keys when not being strict about\n  acceptor names while reading AP-REQs (RT#7883, #1078888)\n- define _GNU_SOURCE in files where we use EAI_NODATA, to make sure that\n  it's declared (#1059730,#1084068,#1109102)\n\n[1.12.2-4]\n- kpropd hasn't bothered with -S since 1.11; stop trying to use that flag\n  in the systemd unit file\n\n[1.12.2-3]\n- pull in upstream fix for an incorrect check on the value returned by a\n  strdup() call (#1132062)\n\n[1.12.1-15]\n- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_21_22_Mass_Rebuild\n\n[1.12.2-2]\n- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_21_22_Mass_Rebuild\n\n[1.12.2-1]\n- update to 1.12.2\n  -
