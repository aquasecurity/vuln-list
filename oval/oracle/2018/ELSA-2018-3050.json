  "Title": "ELSA-2018-3050:  gnutls security, bug fix, and enhancement update (MODERATE)",
  "Description": "[3.3.29-8.0.1]\n- Include ECDSA KAT into selftests for FIPS140-2 compliance [Orabug 27484156]\n\n[3.3.29-8]\n- Backported --sni-hostname option which allows overriding the hostname\n  advertised to the peer (#1444792)\n- Improved counter-measures in TLS CBC record padding for lucky13 attack\n  (CVE-2018-10844, #1589704, CVE-2018-10845, #1589707)\n- Added counter-measures for 'Just in Time' PRIME + PROBE cache-based attack\n  (CVE-2018-10846, #1589708)\n- Address p11tool issue in object deletion in batch mode (#1375307)\n- Backport PKCS#11 tests from master branch. Some tests were disabled due to\n  unsupported features in 3.3.x (--load-pubkey and --test-sign options, ECC key\n  generation without login, and certificates do not inherit ID from the private\n  key)\n- p11tool explicitly marks certificates and public keys as NOT private objects\n  and private keys as private objects\n- Enlarge buffer size to support resumption with large keys (#1542461)\n- Legacy HMAC-SHA384 cipher suites were disabled by default\n- Added DSA key generation to p11tool (#1464896)\n- Address session renegotiation issue using client certificate (#1434091)\n- Address issue when importing private keys into Atos HSM (#1460125)",
