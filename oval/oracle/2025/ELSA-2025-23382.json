The spurious conflicts\n    in the previous version are gone; ambiguously-defined types and those\n    depending on them are properly shuffled into per-CU dicts; the\n    share-duplicated link mode used by ctfarchive where types only used in\n    one CU end up in a per-CU dict is fully implemented.  This is the\n    version that is upstream.\n    The linker is much faster, uses much less memory, and generates much\n    smaller CTF output (usually better than dwarf2ctf despite emitting\n    function types where dwarf2ctf did not) and is much more robust and\n    more heavily tested.\n  - Remove the nondeduplicating CTF linker, and dead code supporting\n    impossible things unnamed typedefs and basic types\n  - Backport the new ld-ctf and libctf testsuites\n  - New linker options --ctf-variables (off by default), --ctf-share-types\n  - func info / data object support (needs compiler changes for\n    working func info support, but all the code is there in binutils now);\n    new API functions to add symbols to a dict, look them up, and iterate over\n    them: ctf_symbol_next, ctf_add_objt_sym, ctf_add_func_sym,\n    ctf_link_add_linker_symbol, ctf_arc_lookup_symbol, ctf_lookup_by_symbol_name,\n    ctf_arc_lookup_symbol_name\n  - Backport numerous bugfixes: fix handling of function types' arglists,\n    allow ctf_type_reference of dynamic slices; prevent some causes of\n    munmap()s of random chunks of memory; improved handling of corrupted\n    dicts; improve dump output some more; fix some error handling bugs;\n    fix opening CTF in binaries with a strtab but no symtab; use a more reliable\n    method to ensure the output has exactly one .ctf section; use the dynamic\n    sections for strings and symbols so that CTF is not corrupted by strip(1);\n    improve the CTF dumper; support unnamed structure members better; fix a\n    theoretical buffer overrun when looking up symbols by name; improve\n    pointer lookup by name in dicts with parents; don't lose types or corrupt\n    the dict when looking up or adding more types in writable dicts after\n    serializing the dict\n  - more armoring against invalid CTF and prevention of wrong results when\n    asking for things like the size of opaque forwards or the encoding of enums\n  - gettextization\n  - New public API also used by the deduplicator: improved error reporting and\n    assertion failures; improved _next iterators with most _iter iterators\n    reimplemented using them, new API functions *_next, ctf_type_name_raw,\n    ctf_type_kind_forwarded, ctf_ref, ctf_member_count, ctf_archive_count,\n    ctf_arc_flush_caches, ctf_getsymsect, ctf_getstrsect, ctf_symsect_endianness,\n    ctf_arc_symsect_endianness, ctf_add_unknown; add ctf_dict_t as a recommended\n    new typename for the deprecated ctf_file_t, and new functions with _dict in\n    the name; add the ability to filter out variables from the link\n  - New internal infrastructure: new internal dynhash functions and a new dynset\n    type; higher-efficiency dynhashes; removal of unnecessary duplication in\n    type lookup paths; add optional lazy loading of CTF \u003eat link time (not used\n    by ld); make cu-mapping links (as used by ctfarchive) take much less memory\n  - Run make check in libctf too.\n  - Reviewed-by: David Faust \u003cdavid.faust@oracle.com\u003e\n  May-18-2021 David Faust  \u003cdavid.faust@oracle.com\u003e - 2.30-93.0.1\n  - Forward-port Oracle patches from 2.30-90.0.1\n  - Reviewed-by: Elena Zannoni \u003celena.zannoni@oracle.com\u003e\n  April-02-2021 David Faust  \u003cdavid.faust@oracle.com\u003e - 2.30-90.0.1\n  - Forward-port Oracle patches from 2.30-79.0.1\n  - Reviewed-by: Jose E.
