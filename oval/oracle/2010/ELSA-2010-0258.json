  "Title": "ELSA-2010-0258:  pam_krb5 security and bug fix update (LOW)",
  "Description": "[2.2.14-15]\n- update backport for selecting which key to use for validation so that it\n  prefers services with the local host name as the instance, from HEAD (more\n  of #450776)\n\n[2.2.14-14]\n- backport the 'multiple_ccaches' option from HEAD, requiring that it\n  be enabled to not immediately remove an old ccache when asked to create\n  a new one (#463417)\n\n[2.2.14-13]\n- add patch to add the 'chpw_prompt' option, to allow the older behavior\n  of attempting a password-change during authentication if libkrb5 detects\n  an expired password, based on patch from Olivier Fourdan (#509092)\n\n[2.2.14-12]\n- dont vary the password prompt depending on whether or not the user exists\n  or is known to the KDC (CVE-2009-1384, #505265)\n- prefer using the 'host' service when verifying that a TGT isnt forged,\n  from HEAD (#450776)\n\n[2.2.14-11]\n- dont enforce minimum_uid when no_user_check is also used, from\n  HEAD (#490404)\n- dont try to get password-changing creds with all of the flags set\n  that we would request for a TGT (#489015)",
