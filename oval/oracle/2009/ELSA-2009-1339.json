  "Title": "ELSA-2009-1339:  rgmanager security, bug fix, and enhancement update (LOW)",
  "Description": "[2.0.52-1.0.1]\n- Update summary and description to be vendor neutral\n\n[2.0.52-1]\n- When vm.sh does a status check and gets 'no state' it is now treated as a\n  running state.\n- Resolves: rhb#514044\n\n[2.0.51-1]\n- In some cases virtual machines will be restarted after a successful migration\n  when the cluster configuration is updated.\n- Resolves: rhbz#505340\n\n[2.0.50-1]\n- Extra checks from the oracle agents have been removed.\n- Several fixes to prevent DOS attacks through insecure use of /tmp/ files have\n  been implemented.\n- vm.sh now uses libvirt\n- Users can now define an explicit service processing order when\n  central_processing is enabled\n- Resolves: rhbz#470917 rhbz#412911 rhbz#468691 rhbz#492828\n\n[2.0.49-1]\n- Rgmanger now checks to see if it has been killed by the OOM killer and if\n  so, reboots the node.\n- Resolves: rhbz#488072\n\n[2.0.48-1]\n- clulog now accepts '-' as the first character in messages.\n- If expire_time is 0 max_restarts is no longer ignored.\n- SAP scripts have been updated.\n- Empty PID files no longer cause resource start failures.\n- Recovery policy of type restart now works properly when using a resource\n  based on ra-skelet.sh\n- startup_wait option has been added to the mysql resource agent.\n- samba.sh now kills the pid listed in the proper pid file.\n- Handling of '-F' has been improved to fix issues with rgmanager crashing if\n  no members of a restricted failover domain are online and rgmanager failing\n  to correctly restart service is they fail on the first node.\n- Enabled ability to prioritize services.\n- It is now possible to cap the number of simultaneious status checks to\n  prevent load spikes.\n- Enabling a frozen service no longer fails and leaves the service in a failed\n  state.\n- Forking and cloning during status checks has been optimized to reduce load\n  spikes.\n- rg_test no longers hangs when running against a cluster due to the removal\n  of an 8MB memory cap.\n- Resolves: rhbz#471431 rhbz#475826 rhbz#474444 rhbz#449394 rhbz#481058 rhbz#483093 rhbz#486711 rhbz#486717 rhbz#482858 rhbz#487598 rhbz#488714 rhbz#250718 rhbz#490455",
