  "Description": "[2.0.115-1]\n- RSA II fencing agent has been fixed.\n- Resolves: rhbz#493802\n\n[2.0.114-1]\n- local variable 'verbose_filename' referenced before assignment has been fixed\n- RSA II fencing agent has been fixed.\n- Resolves: rhbz#493802 rhbz#514758\n\n[2.0.113-1]\n- Limitations with 2-node fence_scsi are now properly documented in the man\n  page.\n- Resolves: rhbz#512998\n\n[2.0.112-1]\n- The pexpect exception is now properly checked in fence agents.\n- Resolves: rhbz#501586\n\n[2.0.111-1]\n- cman_tool leave remove does now properly reduces quorum.\n- Resolves: rhbz#505258\n\n[2.0.110-1]\n- Updated fence_lpar man page to remove options that do not yet exist.\n- Resolves: rhbz#498045\n\n[2.0.108-1]\n- A semaphore leak in cman has been fixed.\n- Resolves: rhbz#505594\n\n[2.0.107-1]\n- Added man page for lpar fencing agent (fence_lpar). \n- Resolves: rhbz#498045\n\n[2.0.106-1]\n- The lssyscfg command can take longer than the shell timeout which will\n  cause fencing to fail, we now wait longer for the lssyscfg command to\n  complete.\n- Resolves: rhbz#504705\n\n[2.0.105-1]\n- The fencing agents no longer fail with pexpect exceptions.\n- Resolves: rhbz#501586\n\n[2.0.104-1]\n- Broadcast communcations are now possible with cman\n- fence_lpar can now login to IVM systems\n- Resolves: rhbz#502674 rhbz#492808\n\n[2.0.103-1]\n- fence_apc no longer fails with a pexpect exception\n- symlink vulnerabilities in fance_apc_snmp were fixed\n- The virsh fencing agent was added.\n- Resolves: rhbz#496629 rhbz#498952 rhbz#501586\n\n[2.0.102-1]\n- Correct return code is checked during disk scanning check.\n- Resolves: rhbz#484956\n\n[2.0.101-1]\n- The SCSI fence agent now verifies that sg_persist is installed properly.\n- The DRAC5 fencing agent now properly handles a modulename.\n- QDisk now logs warning messages if it appears it's I/O to shared storage\n  is hung.\n- Resolves: rhbz#496724 rhbz#500450 rhbz#500567\n\n[2.0.100-1]\n- Support has been added for ePowerSwitch 8+ devices\n- cluster.conf files can now have more than 52 entries inside a block inside\n[block]\n- The output of the group_tool dump sub commands are no longer NULL padded.\n- Using device='' instead of label='' no longer causes qdiskd to incorrectly\n  exit\n- The IPMI fencing agent has been modified to timeout after 10 seconds.  It is\n  also now possible to specify a different timeout with the '-t' option.\n- The IPMI fencing agent now allows punctuation in the password\n- Quickly starting and stopping the cman service no longer causes the cluster\n  membership to become inconsistent across the cluster\n- An issue with lock syncing causing 'receive_own from ...' errors in syslog\n  has been fixed\n- An issue which caused gfs_controld to segfault when mounting hundreds of\n  filesystems has been fixed\n- The LPAR fencing agent now properly reports status when an LPAR is in\n  Open Firmware\n- The APC SNMP fencing agent now properly recognizes outletStatusOn and\n  outletStatusOff returns codes from the SNMP agent\n- WTI Fencing agent can now connect to fencing devices with no password\n- The rps-10 fencing agent now properly performs a reboot when run with no\n  options.\n- The IPMI fencing agent now supports different cipher types with the '-C'\n  option\n- Qdisk now properly scans devices and partitions\n- Added support for LPAR/HMC v3\n- cman now checks to see if a new node has state to prevent killing the first\n  node during cluster setup\n- service qdiskd start now works properly\n- The McData fence agent now works properly with the Sphereon 4500 model\n- The Egenera fence agent can now specify an ssh login name\n- APC Fence agent works with non-admin accounts with firmware 3.5.x\n- fence_xvmd now tries two methods to reboot a virtual machine\n- Connections to openais are now allowed from unprivileged CPG clients with\n  user and group of 'ais'\n- Support has been added for Cisco 9124/9134 SAN switches\n- groupd no longer allows the default fence domain to be '0' which would cause\n  rgmanager to hang\n- The RSA fence agent now supports ssh enabled RSA II devices\n- DRAC fence agent now works with iDRAC on the Dell M600 Blade Chassis\n- fence_drac5 now shows proper usage instructions\n- cman no longer uses the wrong node name when getnameinfo() fails\n- The SCSI fence agent now verifies that sg_persist is installed properly\n- Resolves: rhbz#467112 rhbz#468966 rhbz#470318 rhbz#276541 rhbz#447964 rhbz#472786 rhbz#474163 rhbz#480401 rhbz#481566 rhbz#484095 rhbz#481664 rhbz#322291 rhbz#447497 rhbz#484956 rhbz#485700 rhbz#485026 rhbz#485199 rhbz#470983 rhbz#488958 rhbz#487501 rhbz#491640 rhbz#480178 rhbz#485469 rhbz#480836 rhbz#493207 rhbz#493802 rhbz#462390 rhbz#498329 rhbz#488565 rhbz#499871",
