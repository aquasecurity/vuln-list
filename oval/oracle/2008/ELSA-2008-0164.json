  "Description": "[1.6.1-17.el5_1.1]\n - add preliminary patch to fix use of uninitialized pointer / double-free in\n   KDC (CVE-2008-0062,CVE-2008-0063) (#432620, #432621)\n - add backported patch to fix use-after-free in libgssapi_krb5 \n (CVE-2007-5901)\n   (#415321)\n - add backported patch to fix double-free in libgssapi_krb5 (CVE-2007-5971)\n   (#415351)\n - add preliminary patch to fix incorrect handling of high-numbered \n descriptors\n   in the RPC library (CVE-2008-0947) (#433596)\n - fix storage of delegated krb5 credentials when they've been wrapped up in\n   spnego (#436460)\n - return a delegated credential handle even if the application didn't pass a\n   location to store the flags which would be used to indicate that \n credentials\n   were delegated (#436465)\n - add patch to fall back to TCP kpasswd servers for kdc-unreachable,\n   can't-resolve-server, and response-too-big errors (#436467)\n - use the right sequence numbers when generating password-set/change \n requests\n   for kpasswd servers after the first one (#436468)\n - backport from 1.6.3 to initialize a library-allocated get_init_creds_opt\n   structure the same way we would one which was allocated by the calling\n   application, to restore kinit's traditional behavior of doing a password\n   change right when it detects an expired password (#436470)",
