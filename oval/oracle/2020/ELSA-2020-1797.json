  "Title": "ELSA-2020-1797:  binutils security and bug fix update (LOW)",
  "Description": "[2.30-73.0.1]\n- Forward-port of Oracle patches from 2.30-68.0.2.\n- Reviewed-by: Elena Zannoni \u003celena.zannoni@oracle.com\u003e\n\n[2.30-68.0.2]\n- Backport the non-cycle-detecting-capable deduplicating CTF linker\n- Backport a fix for an upstream hashtab crash (no upstream bug number),\n  triggered by the above.\n- Fix deduplication of ambiguously-named types in CTF.\n- CTF types without names are not ambiguously-named.\n- Stop the CTF_LINK_EMPTY_CU_MAPPINGS flag crashing.\n- Only emit ambiguous types as hidden if they are named and there is already\n  a type with that name.\n- Make sure completely empty dicts get their header written out properly\n- Do not fail if adding anonymous struct/union members to structs/unions that\n  already contain other anonymous members at a different offset\n- Correctly look up pointers to non-root-visible structures\n- Emit error messages in dumping into the dump stream\n- Do not abort early on dump-time errors\n- Elide likely duplicates (same name, same kind) within a single TU (cross-\n  TU duplicate/ambiguous-type detection works as before).\n- Fix linking of the CTF variable section\n- Fix spurious conflicts of variables (also affects the nondeduplicating linker)\n- Defend against CUs without names\n- When linking only a single input file, set the output CTF CU name to the\n  name of the input\n- Support cv-qualified bitfields\n- Fix off-by-one error in SHA-1 sizing\n\n[2.30-73]\n- Remove bogus assertion.  (#1801879)\n\n[2.30-72]\n- Allow the BFD library to handle the copying of files containing secondary reloc sections.  (#1801879)\n\n[2.30-68.0.1]\n- Ensure 8-byte alignment for AArch64 stubs.\n- Add CTF support to OL8: CTF machinery, including libctf.so and\n  libctf-nonbfd.so.  The linker does not yet deduplicate the CTF type section.\n- Backport of fix for upstream bug 23919, required by above\n- [Orabug: 30102938] [Orabug: 30102941]\n\n[2.30-71]\n- Fix a potential seg-fault in the BFD library when parsing pathalogical debug_info sections.  (#1779245)\n- Fix a potential memory exhaustion in the BFD library when parsing corrupt DWARF debug information.\n\n[2.30-70]\n- Re-enable strip merging build notes.  (#1777760)\n\n[2.30-69]\n- Fix linker testsuite failures triggered by annobin update.\n\n[2.30-68]\n- Backport H.J.Lus patch to add a workaround for the JCC Errata to the assembler.  (#1777002)\n\n[2.30-67]\n- Fix a buffer overrun in the note merging code.  (#1774507)\n\n[2.30-66]\n- Fix a seg-fault in gold when linking corrupt input files.  (#1739254)\n\n[2.30-65]\n- NVR bump to allow rebuild with reverted version of glibc in the buildroot.\n\n[2.30-64]\n- Stop note merging with no effect from creating null filled note sections.\n\n[2.30-63]\n- Stop objcopy from generating a exit failure status when merging corrupt notes.\n\n[2.30-62]\n- Fix binutils testsuite failure introduced by -60 patch.  (#1767711)\n\n[2.30-61]\n- Enable threading in the GOLD linker.  (#1729225)\n- Add check to readelf in order to prevent an integer overflow.\n\n[2.30-60]\n- Add support for SVE Vector PCS on AArch64.  (#1726637)\n- Add fixes for coverity test failures.\n- Improve objcopys ability to merge GNU build attribute notes.\n\n[2.30-59]\n- Stop the linker from merging groups with different settings of the SHF_EXCLUDE flag.
