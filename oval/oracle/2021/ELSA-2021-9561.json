  "Title": "ELSA-2021-9561:  openssl security update (MODERATE)",
  "Description": "[1:1.1.1k-4]\n- Fixes bugs in s390x AES code.\n- Uses the first detected address family if IPv6 is not available\n- Reverts the changes in https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13305\n  as it introduces a regression if server has a DSA key pair, the handshake fails\n  when the protocol is not explicitly set to TLS 1.2. However, if the patch is reverted,\n  it has an effect on the 'ssl_reject_handshake' feature in nginx. Although, this feature\n  will continue to work, TLS 1.3 protocol becomes unavailable/disabled. This is already\n  known - https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/2071#comment:1\n  As per https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/16075#issuecomment-879939938, nginx\n  could early callback instead of servername callback.\n- Resolves: rhbz#1978214\n- Related: rhbz#1934534\n\n[1:1.1.1k-3]\n- Cleansup the peer point formats on renegotiation\n- Resolves rhbz#1965362\n\n[1:1.1.1k-2]\n- Fixes FIPS_selftest to work in FIPS mode. Resolves: rhbz#1940085\n- Using safe primes for FIPS DH self-test\n\n[1.1.1k-1]\n- Update to version 1.1.1k\n\n[1.1.1g-16]\n- Use AI_ADDRCONFIG only when explicit host name is given\n- Allow only curves defined in RFC 8446 in TLS 1.3",
