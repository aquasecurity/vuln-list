works on x86/AMD64 because declaring a\n  variable |char| results in an |unsigned char| by default while\n  most other platforms (e.g. { s390x, ppc64, ppc64le, ...})\n  default to |signed char| (still have to use lint(1) to clean\n  up 38 more instances of this kind of bug).\n\n[1.13.2-7]\n- Obsolete multilib versions of server packages to fix RH\n  bug #1251913 ('krb5 should obsolete the multilib

#1252454 ('testsuite complains\n  'Lifetime has increased by 32436 sec while 0 sec passed!',\n  while rhel5-libkrb5 passes') so that krb5 resolves GSS creds\n  if |time_rec| is requested.\n\n[1.13.2-5]\n- Add a patch to fix RedHat bug #1251586 ('KDC sends multiple\n  requests to ipa-otpd for the same authentication') which causes\n  the KDC to send multiple retries to ipa-otpd for TCP transports\n  while it should only be done for UDP.\n\n[1.13.2-4]\n- the rebase to krb5 1.13.2 in vers 1.13.2-0 also fixed:\n  - Redhat Bug #1247761 ('RFE: Minor krb5 spec file cleanup and sync\n    with recent Fedora 22/23 changes')\n  - Redhat Bug #1247751 ('krb5-config returns wrong -specs path')\n  - Redhat Bug #1247608 ('Add support for multi-hop preauth mechs\n    via |KDC_ERR_MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED| for RFC 6113 ('A\n    Generalized Framework for Kerberos Pre-Authentication')')\n- Removed 'krb5-1.10-kprop-mktemp.patch' and\n  'krb5-1.3.4-send-pr-tempfile.patch', both are no longer used since\n  the rebase to krb5 1.13.1\n\n[1.13.2-3]\n- Add patch to fix Redhat Bug #1222903 ('[SELinux] AVC denials may appear\n  when kadmind starts'). The issue was caused by an unneeded |htons()|\n  which triggered SELinux AVC denials due to the 'random' port usage.\n\n[1.13.2-2]\n- Add fix for RedHat Bug #1164304 ('Upstream unit tests loads\n  the installed shared libraries instead the ones from the build')\n\n[1.13.2-1]\n- the rebase to krb5 1.13.1 in vers 1.13.1-0 also fixed:\n  - Bug 1144498 ('Fix the race condition in the libkrb5 replay cache')\n  - Bug 1163402 ('kdb5_ldap_util view_policy does not shows ticket flags on s390x and ppc64')\n  - Bug 1185770 ('Missing upstream test in krb5-1.12.2: src/tests/gssapi/t_invalid.c')\n  - Bug 1204211 ('CVE-2014-5355 krb5: unauthenticated denial of service in recvauth_common() and other')\n\n[1.13.2-0]\n- Update to krb5-1.13.2\n  - drop patch for krb5-1.13.2-CVE_2015_2694_requires_preauth_bypass_in_PKINIT_enabled_KDC, fixed in krb5-1.13.2\n  - drop patch for krb5-1.12.1-CVE_2014_5355_fix_krb5_read_message_handling, fixed in krb5-1.13.2\n\n[1.13.1-2]\n- the rebase to krb5 1.13.1 in vers 1.13.1-0 also fixed RH\n  bug #1156144 ('krb5 upstream test t_kdb.py failure')\n\n[1.13.1-1]\n- fix for CVE-2015-2694 (#1218020) 'requires_preauth bypass\n  in PKINIT-enabled KDC'.\n  In MIT krb5 1.12 and later, when the KDC is configured with\n  PKINIT support, an unauthenticated remote attacker can\n  bypass the requires_preauth flag on a client principal and\n  obtain a ciphertext encrypted in the principal's long-term\n  key.  This ciphertext could be used to conduct an off-line\n  dictionary attack against the user's password.\n\n[1.13.1-0]\n- Update to krb5-1.13.1\n  - patch krb5-1.12-selinux-label was updated and renamed

ksu, without the -e flag, also check .k5users (#1105489)\n  When ksu was explicitly told to spawn a shell, a line in .k5users which\n  listed '*' as the allowed command would cause the principal named on the\n  line to be considered as a candidate for authentication.\n  When ksu was not passed a command to run, which implicitly meant that\n  the invoking user wanted to run the target user's login shell, knowledge\n  that the principal was a valid candidate was ignored, which could cause\n  a less optimal choice of the default target principal.\n  This doesn't impact the authorization checks which we perform later.\n  Patch by Nalin Dahyabhai \u003cnalin@redhat.com\u003e\n\n[1.12.2-9]\n- Undo libkadmclnt SONAME change (from 8 to 9) which originally\n  happened in the krb5 1.12 rebase

builds (zmraz)\n\n[1.10.3-6]\n- actually pull up the patch for RT#7063, and not some other ticket (#773496)\n\n[1.10.3-5]\n- add patch based on one from Filip Krska to not call poll() with a negative\n  timeout when the caller's intent is for us to just stop calling it (#838548)\n\n* Fri Sep 07 2012 Nalin Dahyabhai \u003cnalin@redhat.com\u003e\n- on EL6, conflict with libsmbclient before 3.5.10-124, which is when it\n  stopped linking with a symbol which we no longer export (#771687)\n- pull up patch for RT#7063, in which not noticing a prompt for a long\n  time throws the client library's idea of the time difference between it\n  and the KDC really far out of whack (#773496)\n- add a backport of more patches to set the client's list of supported enctypes\n  when using a keytab to be the list of types of keys in the keytab, plus the\n  list of other types the client supports but for which it doesn't have keys,\n  in that order, so that KDCs have a better chance of being able to issue\n  tickets with session keys of types that the client can use (#837855)\n\n[1.10.3-4]\n- cut down the number of times we load SELinux labeling configuration from\n  a minimum of two times to actually one (more of #845125)\n\n[1.10.3-3]\n- backport patch to disable replay detection in krb5_verify_init_creds()\n  while reading the AP-REQ that's generated in the same function

the list of selinux contexts, freeing and reloading\n  it only when the file we read it from is modified, freeing it when the\n  shared library is being unloaded (#845125)\n\n[1.10.2-6]\n- go back to not messing with library file paths on Fedora 17: it breaks\n  file path dependencies in other packages, and since Fedora 17 is already\n  released, breaking that is our fault\n\n[1.10.2-5]\n- add upstream patch to fix freeing an uninitialized pointer and dereferencing\n  another uninitialized pointer in the KDC (MITKRB5-SA-2012-001, CVE-2012-1014\n  and CVE-2012-1015, #844779 and #844777)\n-

SignedData, but which\n  is available as an anchor or intermediate on the client (RT#7183)\n\n[1.10.2-2]\n- back out this labeling change (dwalsh):\n  - when building the new label for a file we're about to create, also mix\n    in the current range, in addition to the current user\n\n[1.10.2-1]\n- update to 1.10.2\n  - when building the new label for a file we're about to create, also mix\n    in the current range, in addition to the current user\n  - also package the PDF format admin, user, and install guides\n  - drop some PDFs that no longer get built right\n- add a backport of Stef's patch to set the client's list of supported\n  enctypes to match the types of keys that we have when we are using a\n  keytab to try to get initial credentials, so that a KDC won't send us\n  an AS reply that we can't encrypt (RT#2131, #748528)\n- don't shuffle around any shared libraries on releases with no-separate-/usr,\n  since /usr/lib is the same place as /lib\n- add explicit buildrequires: on 'hostname', for the tests, on systems where\n  it's in its own package, and require net-tools, which used to provide the\n  command, everywhere\n\n* Mon May 07 2012 Nalin Dahyabhai

Walter, #805320)\n\n[1.10.1-1]\n- update to 1.10.1\n  - drop the KDC crash fix\n  - drop the KDC lookaside cache fix\n  - drop the fix for kadmind RPC ACLs (CVE-2012-1012)\n\n[1.10-5]\n- when removing -workstation, remove our files from the info index while\n  the file is still there, in %preun, rather than %postun, and use the\n  compressed file's name (#801035)\n\n[1.10-4]\n- Fix string RPC ACLs (RT#7093); CVE-2012-1012\n\n[1.10-3]\n- Add upstream lookaside cache behavior fix (RT#7082)\n\n[1.10-2]\n- add patch to accept keytab entries with vno==0 as matches when we're\n  searching for an

#761317)\n  so that the default principal name can be set to that of the client for which\n  it is proxying, which results in the ccache looking more normal to consumers\n  of the ccache that don't care that there's proxying going on\n- pull in patch for RT#7047: allow tickets obtained via S4U2Proxy to be cached\n  (more of #761317)\n- pull in patch for RT#7048: allow PAC verification to only

for other reasons (#727829, #734172)\n\n[1.9.1-9]\n- override the default build rules to not delete temporary y.tab.c files,\n  so that they can be packaged, allowing debuginfo files which point to them\n  do so usefully (#729044)\n\n[1.9.1-8]\n- build shared libraries with partial RELRO support (#723995)\n- filter out potentially multiple instances of -Wl,-z,relro from krb5-config\n  output,
