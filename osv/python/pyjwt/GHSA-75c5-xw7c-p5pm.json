  "summary": "PyJWT Issuer field partial matches allowed",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe wrong string if check is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `\"acb\"` being accepted for `\"_abc_\"`.\n\n### Details\nThis is a bug introduced in version [2.10.0](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/commit/1570e708672aa9036bc772476beae8bfa48f4131#diff-6893ad4a1c5a36b8af3028db8c8bc3b62418149843fc382faf901eaab008e380R366): checking the \"iss\" claim\nchanged from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer,\nSequence)`.\n\n```diff\n-        if isinstance(issuer, list):\n+        if isinstance(issuer, Sequence):\n            if payload[\"iss\"] not in issuer:\n                raise InvalidIssuerError(\"Invalid issuer\")\n        else:\n```\n\nSince str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for string\ncomparison. This results in `if \"abc\" not in \"__abcd__\":` being\nchecked instead of `if \"abc\" != \"__abc__\":`.\n### PoC\nCheck out the unit tests added here: https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt-ghsa-75c5-xw7c-p5pm\n```python\n        issuer = \"urn:expected\"\n\n        payload = {\"iss\": \"urn:\"}\n\n        token = jwt.encode(payload, \"secret\")\n\n        # decode() succeeds, even though `\"urn:\" != \"urn:expected\". No exception is raised.\n        with pytest.raises(InvalidIssuerError):\n            jwt.decode(token, \"secret\", issuer=issuer, algorithms=[\"HS256\"])\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nI would say the real world impact is not that high, seeing as the signature still has to match. We should still fix it.\n",
