  "summary": "Moonraker affected by LDAP search filter injection",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nInstances of Moonraker configured with the `ldap` component enabled are vulnerable to LDAP search filter injection techniques via the login endpoint.   The 401 error response message can be used to determine whether or not a search was successful, allowing for brute force methods to discover LDAP entries on the server such as user IDs and user attributes.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to Moonraker 0.10.0 which patches this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAdmins can set the `max_login_attempts` option in the `[authorization]` section to a reasonable value.    Any IP attempting to exploit this vulnerability will be locked out after it has reached the specified number of consecutive failed login attempts.  This condition is cleared after a Moonraker restart.   Note that if an attacker knows a valid user password they can bypass this protection by successfully logging in.\n\nThe most secure workaround for users unable to upgrade is to remove the `ldap` section from `moonraker.conf` and rely on the built in user authentication.",
