  "summary": "Scancode.io Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in license endpoint",
  "details": "### Summary\nIn the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist.\n\n### Details\nIn the `/license/` endpoint, the `license_details_view` function is vulnerable to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack due to inadequate validation and sanitization of the `key` parameter. This vulnerability arises when attempting to access a key with malicious javascript.\n\n```python\ndef license_details_view(request, key):\n    \"\"\"\n    Display all available information about a given license `key` followed by\n    the full license text.\n    \"\"\"\n    licenses = get_licenses()\n    try:\n        data = saneyaml.dump(licenses[key].to_dict())\n        text = licenses[key].text\n    except KeyError:\n        return HttpResponseNotFound(f\"License {key} not found.\") # Leads to cross-site scripting when key is malicious javascript\n    return HttpResponse(f\"\u003cpre\u003e{data}\u003c/pre\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cpre\u003e{text}\u003c/pre\u003e\")\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n1. Access following endpoint on scancode.io instance: http://localhost/license/%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie);%3C/script%3E/\n\n### Impact\nAttackers can exploit the vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information.\n",
