  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe initial vulnerability identified in Streamlit apps using custom components, allowing for directory traversal attacks, was addressed in version 1.11.1.

Users are strongly advised to update to version 1.30.0 immediately for optimal security.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo additional workarounds are necessary once the update to version 1.30.0 is applied.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@streamlit.io](mailto:security@streamlit.io)",
