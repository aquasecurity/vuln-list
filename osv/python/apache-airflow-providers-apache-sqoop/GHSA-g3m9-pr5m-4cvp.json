  "summary": "Airflow Sqoop Provider RCE Vulnerability",
  "details": "Apache Airflow Sqoop Provider, versions before 4.0.0, is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker pass parameters with the connections, which makes it possible to implement RCE attacks via ‘sqoop import --connect’, obtain airflow server permissions, etc. The attacker needs to be logged in and have authorization (permissions) to create/edit connections.\n\n It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected.\nThis issue was reported independently by happyhacking-k, And Xie Jianming and LiuHui of Caiji Sec Team also reported it.",
