  ],
  "summary": "Unauthenticated db-file-storage views",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n In Nautobot 1.x and 2.0.x, the URLs `/files/get/?name=...` and `/files/download/?name=...` are used to provide admin access to files that have been uploaded as part of a run request for a Job that has FileVar inputs. Under normal operation these files are ephemeral and are deleted once the Job in question runs. \n\nIt was reported by @kircheneer that in the default implementation used in Nautobot, as provided by `django-db-file-storage`, these URLs do not by default require any user authentication to access; they should instead be restricted to only users who have permissions to view Nautobot's `FileProxy` model instances.\n\nNote that no URL mechanism is provided for listing or traversal of the available file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user would have to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user knows the file name/path value, they can access it without authenticating, so we are considering this a vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixes will be included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround other than applying the patches included in https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4959/files (2.0.x) or https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4964/files (1.6.x)\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/victor-o-silva/db_file_storage/blob/master/db_file_storage/views.py",
