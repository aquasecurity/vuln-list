  ],
  "summary": "Remote Code Execution via unsafe classes in otherwise permitted modules",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. \n\nThe policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution.\n\nBy default, you need to have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2.\nOnly AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7.\n\n### Workarounds\nA site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [AccessControl issue tracker](https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/issues)\n* Email us at [security@plone.org](mailto:security@plone.org)\n",
