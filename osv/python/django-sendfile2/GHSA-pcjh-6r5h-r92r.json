  "summary": "django-sendfile2 before 0.7.0 contains reflected file download vulnerability",
  "details": "Similar to CVE-2022-36359 for Django, django-sendfile2 did not protect against a reflected file download attack in version 0.6.1 and earlier. If the file name used by django-sendfile2 was derived from user input, then it would be possible to perform a such an attack. A new version of django-sendfile2 will be released. Either download django-sendfile2 0.7.0 as a workaround or sanitize user input yourself, using Django's patch as a template: https://github.com/django/django/commit/bd062445cffd3f6cc6dcd20d13e2abed818fa173",
