  "details": "JSNAPy is an open source python version of Junos Snapshot Administrator developed by Juniper available through github.

This insecure file and directory permission allows unprivileged local users to alter the files under this directory including inserting operations not intended by the package maintainer, system administrator, or other users. This issue only affects users who downloaded and installed JSNAPy from github.",
