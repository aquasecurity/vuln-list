  "summary": "Use after free / memory leak in `CollectiveReduceV2`",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe [async implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/collective_ops.cc#L604-L615) of `CollectiveReduceV2` suffers from a memory leak and a use after free:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ntf.raw_ops.CollectiveReduceV2(\n  input=[],\n  group_size=[-10, -10, -10],\n  group_key=[-10, -10],\n  instance_key=[-10],\n  ordering_token=[],\n  merge_op='Mul',\n  final_op='Div')\n``` \n\nThis occurs due to the asynchronous computation and the fact that objects that have been `std::move()`d from are still accessed:\n\n```cc\nauto done_with_cleanup = [col_params, done = std::move(done)]() {\n  done();\n  col_params-\u003eUnref();\n};\nOP_REQUIRES_OK_ASYNC(c,\n                     FillCollectiveParams(col_params, REDUCTION_COLLECTIVE,\n                                          /*group_size*/ c-\u003einput(1),\n                                          /*group_key*/ c-\u003einput(2),\n                                          /*instance_key*/ c-\u003einput(3)),\n                     done);\n```\n\nHere, `done` is already moved from by the time `OP_REQUIRES_OK_ASYNC` macro needs to invoke it in case of errors. In this case, we get an undefined behavior, which can manifest via crashes, `std::bad_alloc` throws or just memory leaks.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ca38dab9d3ee66c5de06f11af9a4b1200da5ef75](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ca38dab9d3ee66c5de06f11af9a4b1200da5ef75).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.\n",
