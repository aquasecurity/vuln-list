  "summary": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound in Google TensorFlow",
  "details": "### Issue Description\nGoogle TensorFlow 1.7.x and earlier is affected by a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. The type of exploitation is context-dependent. The block size in meta file might contain a large int64 value which causes an integer overflow upon addition. Subsequent code using n as index may cause an out-of-bounds read.\n\n### Impact\nA maliciously crafted meta checkpoint could be used to cause the TensorFlow process to perform an out of bounds read on in process memory.\n",
