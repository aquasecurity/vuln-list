  "details": "### Impact\nAny users whom would not desire a traceback to be included in their logs whenever an error is raised in their code will be affected.\n\nIf users have inadvertently created a scenario in their code that could cause a traceback to include sensitive information _and_ a malicious entity gained access to their log stream, this could create an issue.\n\n### Patches\nNone yet... users will need to upgrade to `0.4.*`\n\n### Workarounds\nNo particularly reasonable ones at present.\n\n### References\n* https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/453.html\n* https://www.invicti.com/web-vulnerability-scanner/vulnerabilities/stack-trace-disclosure-python/",
