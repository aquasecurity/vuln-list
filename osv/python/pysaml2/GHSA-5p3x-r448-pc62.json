  "summary": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in PySAML2",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAll users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 \u003c= 6.4.1` does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend is using the `xmlsec1` binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default, `xmlsec1` accepts any type of key found within the given document. `xmlsec1` needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround provided at this point.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue has been reported in the past at the xmlsec1 mailing list:\nhttps://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2013/009717.html\n\n### Credits\n\n- Brian Wolff\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pysaml2](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2)\n* Email us at [the incident-response address](mailto:incident-response@idpy.org)\n",
