Then, a process running in background periodically connects to a remote host and waits for the next code to execute.\n\nThe malicious code was in version 1.3.0, but the package itself was clearly uploaded with malclious intentions.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-11-spellcheckers\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n",
