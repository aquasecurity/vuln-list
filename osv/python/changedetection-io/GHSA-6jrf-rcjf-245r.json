  "summary": "changedetection.io path traversal using file URI scheme without supplying hostname",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe validation for the file URI scheme falls short, and results in an attacker being able to read any file on the system. This issue only affects instances with a webdriver enabled, and `ALLOW_FILE_URI` false or not defined.\n\n### Details\n\nThe check used for URL protocol, `is_safe_url`, allows `file:` as a URL scheme:\n\nhttps://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/blob/e0abf0b50507a8a3d0c1d8522ab23519b3e4cdf4/changedetectionio/model/Watch.py#L11-L13\n\nIt later checks if local files are permitted, but one of the preconditions for the check is that the URL starts with `file://`. The issue comes with the fact that the file URI scheme is not required to have double slashes.\n\n\u003e A valid file URI must therefore begin with either `file:/path` (no hostname), `file:///path` (empty hostname), or `file://hostname/path`.\n\u003e â€” [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme#Number_of_slash_characters)\n\nhttps://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/blob/e0abf0b50507a8a3d0c1d8522ab23519b3e4cdf4/changedetectionio/processors/__init__.py#L37-L41\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Open up a changedetection.io instance with a webdriver configured\n2. Create a new watch: `file:/etc/passwd` or a similar path for your operating system. Enable webdriver mode\n3. Wait for it to be checked\n4. Open preview\n5. Notice contents of the file\n",
