  "details": "### Impact\nVia a type confusion bug in the CPython interpreter when using `try/except*` RestrictedPython could be bypassed.\n\nWe believe this should be fixed upstream in Python itself until that we remove support for `try/except*` from RestrictedPython.\n(It has been fixed for some Python versions.)\n\n### Patches\nPatched in version 8.0 by removing support for `try/except*` clauses\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround.\n\n### References\nnone\n",
