  ],
  "summary": "OctoPrint vulnerable to XSS in Action Commands Notification and Prompt",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nOctoPrint versions up to and including 1.11.3 are affected by a vulnerability that allows injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into Action Command notification and prompt popups generated by the printer.\n\nAn attacker who successfully convinces a victim to print a specially crafted file could exploit this issue to disrupt ongoing prints, extract information (including sensitive configuration settings, if the targeted user has the necessary permissions for that), or perform other actions on behalf of the targeted user within the OctoPrint instance.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability will be patched in version 1.11.4.\n\n### Workaround\n\nOctoPrint administrators can mitigate the risk by disabling popups:\n- for Action Command notifications, uncheck _OctoPrint Settings -\u003e Printer Notifications -\u003e Enable popups_\n- for Action Command prompts, set _OctoPrint Settings -\u003e Printer Dialogs -\u003e Enable support -\u003e Never_\n\nIt is also strongly recommended to ensure that files being printed originate from trusted sources, and, whenever possible, are sliced with your own slicer.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by [Jacopo Tediosi](https://github.com/jacopotediosi).",
