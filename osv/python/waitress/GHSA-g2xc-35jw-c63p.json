  "summary": "HTTP Request Smuggling: Invalid Transfer-Encoding in Waitress",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWaitress would parse the `Transfer-Encoding` header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not `chunked` it would fall through and use the `Content-Length` header instead.\n\nAccording to the HTTP standard `Transfer-Encoding` should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with `chunked`.\n\nRequests sent with:\n\n```\nTransfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\n```\n\nWould incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a `Content-Length` header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message.\n\nThis could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0. This brings a range of changes to harden Waitress against potential HTTP request confusions, and may change the behaviour of Waitress behind non-conformist proxies. \n\nWaitress will now return a 501 Not Implemented error if the `Transfer-Encoding` is not `chunked` or contains multiple elements. Waitress does not support any transfer codings such as `gzip` or `deflate`.\n\nThe Pylons Project recommends upgrading as soon as possible, while validating that the changes in Waitress don\u0026#39;t cause any changes in behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nVarious reverse proxies may have protections against sending potentially bad HTTP requests to the backend, and or hardening against potential issues like this. If the reverse proxy doesn\u0026#39;t use HTTP/1.1 for connecting to the backend issues are also somewhat mitigated, as HTTP pipelining does not exist in HTTP/1.0 and Waitress will close the connection after every single request (unless the Keep Alive header is explicitly sent... so this is not a fool proof security method).\n\n### Issues/more security issues:\n\n* open an issue at https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)",
