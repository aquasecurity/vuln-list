  "summary": "Catastrophic backtracking in regex allows Denial of Service in Waitress",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen waitress receives a header that contains invalid characters it will cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use 100% CPU time and blocking any other interactions.\n\nThis would allow an attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the service offline.\n\nInvalid header example:\n\n```\nBad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\x10\n```\n\nIncreasing the number of `x`'s in the header will increase the amount of time Waitress spends in the regular expression engine.\n\nThis issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression was updated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associated with RFC7230.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe regular expression that is used to validate incoming headers has been updated in version 1.4.3, it is recommended that people upgrade to the new version of Waitress as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you have deployed a reverse proxy in front of Waitress it may already be rejecting requests that include invalid headers.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThe Pylons Project would like to thank [Fil Zembowicz](https://github.com/fzembow) for reaching out and disclosing this vulnerability!\n\n### References\n\nCatastrophic backtracking explained: https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- open an issue at https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n- email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)",
