  "summary": "OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo account cannot process transactions on Goerli",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability affects all accounts (vanilla and ethereum flavors) in the [v0.2.0 release of OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.0), which are not whitelisted on StarkNet mainnet, so only goerli deployments of v0.2.0 accounts are affected.\n\nThis faulty behavior is not observed in [StarkNet's testing framework](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/testing/starknet.py), so don't rely on it passing to detect this issue on custom accounts.\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been patched in [v0.2.1](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.1).\n\n### References\nThe issue is detailed in https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/386.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Contracts for Cairo repo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com)\n",
