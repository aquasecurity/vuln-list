  "summary": "Implementation trusts the \"me\" field returned by the authorization server without verifying it",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA malicious user can sign in as a user with any IndieAuth identifier. This is because the implementation does not verify that the final `\"me\"` URL value returned by the authorization server belongs to the same domain as the initial value entered by the user.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 1.1 fixes this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround. Upgrade to 1.1 immediately.\n\n### References\n\n- [Security Considerations: Differing User Profile URLs](https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#differing-user-profile-urls-li-1) in the IndieAuth specification.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [simonw/datasette-indieauth](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-indieauth/issues)",
