  "summary": "Python-Future Module Arbitrary Code Execution via Unintended Import of test.py",
  "details": "A vulnerability in Python-Future modules 0.14.0 and above allows for arbitrary code execution via the unintended import of a file named test.py. When the module is loaded, it automatically imports test.py, if present in the same directory or in the sys.path. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to write files to the server, allowing the execution of arbitrary code.",
