  "summary": "Withdrawn Advisory: Python-Future Module Arbitrary Code Execution via Unintended Import of test.py",
  "details": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it describes a documented feature of Python’s import system in the handling of sys.path. For more information, see https://github.com/PythonCharmers/python-future/issues/650.\n\n## Original Description\n\nA vulnerability in the Python-Future 1.0.0 module allows for arbitrary code execution via the unintended import of a file named test.py. When the module is loaded, it automatically imports test.py, if present in the same directory or in the sys.path. This behavior can be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to write files to the server, allowing the execution of arbitrary code. NOTE: Multiple third parties have disputed this issue and stated that it is not a security flaw in python-future and is a documented feature of Python’s import system in the handling of sys.path.",
