  "details": "OMERO.web is open source Django-based software for managing microscopy imaging. OMERO.web before version 5.9.0 loads various information about the current user such as their id, name and the groups they are in, and these are available on the main webclient pages. This represents an information exposure vulnerability. Some additional information being loaded is not used by the webclient and is being removed in this release. This is fixed in version 5.9.0.",
