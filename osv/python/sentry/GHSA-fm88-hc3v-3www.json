  "summary": "Sentry vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform integration allows the storage of arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side. This payload could subsequently be rendered on the Issues page, creating a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability might lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of a userâ€™s browser.\n\nSelf-hosted Sentry users may be impacted if untrustworthy Integration platform integrations send external issues to their Sentry instance.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch has been released in [Sentry 24.7.1](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/24.7.1)\n\n### Workarounds\nFor Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed. This has been patched on July 22, and even prior to the fix, the exploitation was not possible due to the strict Content Security Policy deployed on sentry.io site.\n\nFor self-hosted users, we strongly recommend upgrading Sentry to the latest version. If it is not possible, you could [enable CSP on your self-hosted installation](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/csp/) with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY = False` (enforcing mode). This will mitigate the risk of XSS.\n\n### References\n* Sentry Docs: [Integration platform / Create an External Issue](https://docs.sentry.io/api/integration/create-an-external-issue/)\n* Sentry Docs: [Self-hosted CSP](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/csp/)\n* The fix: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/74648\n* PortSwigger: [Stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored)",
