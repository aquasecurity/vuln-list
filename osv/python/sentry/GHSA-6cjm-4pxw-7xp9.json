  "summary": "Sentry vulnerable to leaking superuser cleartext password in logs",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen authenticating as a superuser to a self-hosted Sentry instance with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser.\n\n### Patches\n- Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later.\n- Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. This vulnerability is not applicable to SaaS.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or higher. For details on configuring self-hosted Sentry's logging level see our documentation at: https://develop.sentry.dev/config/#logging\n\n### References\n- Bug introduced in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/66393\n- Security fix in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/69148",
