Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110\n* https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [d0c-s4vage/lookatme](https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme)",
