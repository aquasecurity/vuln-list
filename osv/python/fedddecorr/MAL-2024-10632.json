Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author.

It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (cc66a9468084778c64db11788f56ad9ed1de1440f2ed8536ccbeecca7c5102af)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'fedddecorr' @ 94.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
