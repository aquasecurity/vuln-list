  ],
  "summary": "Nautobot Single Source of Truth (SSoT) has an unauthenticated ServiceNow configuration URL",
  "details": "The servicenow config URL is using a generic django View with no authentication.\n\nURL: `/plugins/ssot/servicenow/config/`\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nAn Unauthenticated attacker could access this page to view the Service Now public instance name e.g. `companyname.service-now.com`. This is considered **low-value information**.  This does not expose the Secret, the Secret Name, or the Secret Value for the Username/Password for Service-Now.com. An unauthenticated member would not be able to change the instance name, nor set a Secret. There is not a way to gain access to other pages Nautobot through the unauthenticated Configuration page.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\nWe highly recommend upgrading to SSoT v3.10.0 which includes this patch.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nDisable the servicenow SSoT integration",
