In this version, the exfiltrating is masked as connecting to an AWS component. The URL to the component is expected to be hex-encoded. In fact, the related GitHub project uses it as a dependency and sets as the URL the attacker-controlled domain. In this way, the AWS libraries are abused to generate the request to the malicious infrastructure and exfiltrate credentials.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-08-aws-enumerate\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - exfiltration-generic\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - exfiltration-credentials\n",
