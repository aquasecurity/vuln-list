It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (beb1552081b1c9dbb3ac3a02af3a0736a378b9c23dedfda4944d73a797611557)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'tiketoken' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
