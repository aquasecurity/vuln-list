  "summary": "DB-GPT vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery",
  "details": "In version 0.6.0 of eosphoros-ai/db-gpt, the `uvicorn` app created by `dbgpt_server` uses an overly permissive instance of `CORSMiddleware` which sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` for all requests. This configuration makes all endpoints exposed by the server vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to interact with any endpoints of the instance, even if the instance is not publicly exposed to the network.",
