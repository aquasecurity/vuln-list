  "summary": "scikit-learn Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
  "details": "scikit-learn (aka sklearn) through 0.23.0 can unserialize and execute commands from an untrusted file that is passed to the `joblib.load()` function, if `__reduce__` makes an `os.system call`.\nNOTE: third parties dispute this issue because the joblib.load() function is documented as unsafe and it is the user's responsibility to use the function in a secure manner.",
