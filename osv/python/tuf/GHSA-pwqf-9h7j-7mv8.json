  ],
  "summary": "Incorrect threshold signature computation in TUF",
  "details": "### Impact\nMetadadata signature verification, as used in `tuf.client.updater`, counted each of multiple signatures with identical authorized keyids  separately towards the threshold. Therefore, an attacker with access to a valid signing key could create multiple valid signatures in order to meet the minimum threshold of keys before the metadata was considered valid.\n\nThe tuf maintainers would like to thank Erik MacLean of Analog Devices, Inc. for reporting this issue.\n\n### Patches\nA [fix](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/974) is available in version [0.12.2](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.12.2) or newer.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are known for this issue.\n\n### References\n* [CVE-2020-6174](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6174)\n* Pull request resolving the issue [PR 974](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/974)",
