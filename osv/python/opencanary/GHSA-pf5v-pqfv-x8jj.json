  "summary": "OpenCanary Executes Commands From Potentially Writable Config File",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nOpenCanary directly executed commands taken from its config file. Where the config file is stored in an unprivileged user directory but the daemon is executed by root, itâ€™s possible for the unprivileged user to change the config file and escalate permissions when root later runs the daemon.\n\nThanks to the folks at [Whirlylabs](https://whirlylabs.com/) for finding and fixing this.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.9.4 or higher.",
