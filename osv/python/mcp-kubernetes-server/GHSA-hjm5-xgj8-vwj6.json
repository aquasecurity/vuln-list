  ],
  "summary": "mcp-kubernetes-server has a Command Injection vulnerability",
  "details": "`mcp-kubernetes-server` does not correctly enforce the `--disable-write` / `--disable-delete` protections when commands are chained. The server only inspects the first token to decide whether an operation is write/delete, which allows a read-like command to be followed by a write action using shell metacharacters (e.g., `kubectl version; kubectl delete pod \u003cname\u003e`). A remote attacker who can invoke the server may therefore bypass the intended write/delete restrictions and perform state-changing operations against the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n**Affected versions:** through `0.1.11` (no patched release available as of now).\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Run with `--disable-kubectl` and/or `--disable-helm` to fully block those execution paths.\n- Put the server behind an allow-list proxy restricting allowed subcommands.",
