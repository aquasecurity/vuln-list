  "summary": "Bugsink is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote DoS via crafted Brotli input (via CPU)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIn affected versions, a specially crafted Brotli-compressed envelope can cause Bugsink to spend excessive CPU time in decompression, leading to denial of service.\n\nThis can be done if the DSN is known, which it is in many common setups (JavaScript, Mobile Apps).\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in Bugsink 2.0.6\n\n### References\n\nThe vulnerability in this security advisory is similar to, but distinct from, another brotli-related problem in Bugsink:\n\nhttps://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/security/advisories/GHSA-fc2v-vcwj-269v",
