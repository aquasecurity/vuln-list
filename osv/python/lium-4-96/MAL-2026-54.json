The script then downloads an archive with malicious executable in the version appropriate to the system architecture, and ensures persistency by adding automatically started service entries. The remote code is a Go-based inforstealer and backdoor previously attributed to Nordkorean cybercrime activities. In this campaign, the malicious code is not immediately introduced in the typosquatted package, but added with an update.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-01-gztensor-cli\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - crypto-related\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote executable.\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - peristence-autorun\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - backdoor\n\n\n - infostealer\n",
