  "summary": "Gakido vulnerable to HTTP Header Injection (CRLF Injection) ",
  "details": "A vulnerability was discovered in Gakido that allowed HTTP Header Injection through CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences in user-supplied header values and names.\n\nWhen making HTTP requests with user-controlled header values containing `\\r\\n` (CRLF), `\\n` (LF), or `\\x00` (null byte) characters, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker who can control header values passed to Gakido's `Client.get()`, `Client.post()`, or other request methods could:\n\n1. **Inject arbitrary HTTP headers** - Add malicious headers to requests\n2. **HTTP Response Splitting** - Potentially manipulate responses in certain proxy configurations\n3. **Cache Poisoning** - Inject headers that could poison intermediate caches\n4. **Session Fixation** - Inject session-related headers\n5. **Bypass Security Controls** - Inject headers that bypass server-side security checks\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n```python\nfrom gakido import Client\n\n# Before fix: X-Injected header would be sent as a separate header\nc = Client(impersonate=\"chrome_120\")\nr = c.get(\"https://httpbin.org/headers\", headers={\n    \"User-Agent\": \"test\\r\\nX-Injected: pwned\"\n})\n\n# The server would receive:\n# User-Agent: test\n# X-Injected: pwned\n```\n\n## Affected Code\n\nThe vulnerability existed in the header processing logic where user-supplied headers were not sanitized before being sent in HTTP requests.\n\n**File:** `gakido/headers.py`  \n**Function:** `canonicalize_headers()`\n\n## Fix\n\nThe fix adds a `_sanitize_header()` function that strips `\\r`, `\\n`, and `\\x00` characters from both header names and values before they are included in HTTP requests.\n\n```python\ndef _sanitize_header(name: str, value: str) -\u003e tuple[str, str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sanitize header name and value to prevent HTTP header injection (CRLF injection).\n    Strips CR, LF, and null bytes from both name and value.\n    \"\"\"\n    clean_name = name.replace(\"\\r\", \"\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\").replace(\"\\x00\", \"\")\n    clean_value = value.replace(\"\\r\", \"\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\").replace(\"\\x00\", \"\")\n    return clean_name, clean_value\n```",
