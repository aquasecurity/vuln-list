  "summary": "dmlc/dgl Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution by Pickle Deserialization via rpc.recv_request()",
  "details": "### Impact\nDgl implements rpc server (start_server() in rpc_server.py) for supporting the RPC communications among different remote users over networks. It relies on pickle serialize and deserialize to pack and unpack network messages. The is a known risk in pickle deserialization functionality that can be used for remote code execution.\n\n### Patches\nTBD.\n\n### Workarounds\nWhen running DGL distributed training and inference (DistDGL) make sure you do not assign public IPs to any instance in the cluster.\n\n### References\nIssue #7874\n\n### Reported by\nPinji Chen ([cpj24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:cpj24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)) from NISL lab (https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/about) at Tsinghua University",
