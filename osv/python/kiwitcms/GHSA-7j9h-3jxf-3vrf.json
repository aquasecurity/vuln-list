  ],
  "summary": "Denial of service vulnerability on Password reset page",
  "details": "### Impact\nPrevious versions of Kiwi TCMS do not impose rate limits which makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. \n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v12.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS such as Nginx and/or configure rate limits on their email server when possible.\n\n### References\n[Disclosed by Ahmed Rabeaa Mosaa](https://huntr.dev/bounties/3b712cb6-3fa3-4f71-8562-7a7016c6262e)\n",
