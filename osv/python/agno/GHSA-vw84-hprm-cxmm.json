  "summary": "Agno session state overwrites between different sessions/users",
  "details": "### Impact\nUnder certain conditions (under high concurrency), when `session_state` is passed to an Agent or Team during run or arun calls, a race condition can occur, causing a `session_state` to be assigned and persisted to the incorrect session. This may result in user data from one session being exposed to another user.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in version 2.2.2. Upgrade with `pip install -U agno`.",
