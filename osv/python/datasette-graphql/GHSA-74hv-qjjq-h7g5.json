  "summary": "datasette-graphql leaks details of the schema of private database files",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen running against a Datasette instance with private databases, `datasette-graphql` would expose the schema of those database tables - but not the table contents.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in version 1.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis issue is only present if a Datasette instance that includes private databases and has the `datasette-graphql` plugin installed is available on the public internet. Uninstalling the `datasette-graphql` plugin or preventing public access to the instance can workaround this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [datasette-graphql](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql)\n* Contact [@simonw](https://twitter.com/simonw) by Twitter direct message",
