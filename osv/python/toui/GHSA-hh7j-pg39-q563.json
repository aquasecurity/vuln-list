  "summary": "toui allows user-specific variables to be shared between users",
  "details": "### Impact\nWebsites that use `Website.user_vars` property in versions.\n\n### Patches\nIt affects versions v2.0.1 to v2.4.0. Please upgrade to v2.4.1\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use `Website.user_vars` in websites when using versions v2.0.1 to v2.4.0. Also, do not use `Website.signin_user()` in version v2.4.0 only.\n\n### Explanation\nToUI is using Flask-Caching (SimpleCache) to store user variables. My misunderstanding was that these caches are stored in the client's browser, but it seems that these are stored in the server side.\n",
