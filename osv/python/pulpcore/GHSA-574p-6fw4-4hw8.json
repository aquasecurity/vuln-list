  "details": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the package [pulpcore](https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore/) deals with pulp 3 only. This advisory concerns [pulp 2](https://github.com/pulp/pulp), which is not in a [supported ecosystem](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/README.md#supported-ecosystems).\n\n## Original Description\npulp 2.16.x and possibly older is vulnerable to an improper path parsing. A malicious user or a malicious iso feed repository can write to locations accessible to the 'apache' user. This may lead to overwrite of published content on other iso repositories.",
