  "summary": "Exiv2  has a denial of service due to unbounded recursion in QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder",
  "details": "### Impact\nA denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1: an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2 to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0 (see https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337), so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected.  Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug is fixed in version v0.28.2.\n\n### For more information\nPlease see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.\n\n### Credit\nThis bug was found by [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz).",
