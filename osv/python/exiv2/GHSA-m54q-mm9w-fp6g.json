  "summary": "Exiv2 has quadratic performance in ICC profile parsing in JpegBase::readMetadata",
  "details": "### Impact\nA denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.5: a quadratic algorithm in the ICC profile parsing code in `jpegBase::readMetadata()` can cause Exiv2 to run for a long time. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted jpg image file.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug is fixed in version v0.28.6.\n\n### References\nIssue: https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/3333\nFixes: https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3335 (main branch), https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3345 (0.28.x branch)\n\n### For more information\nPlease see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.",
