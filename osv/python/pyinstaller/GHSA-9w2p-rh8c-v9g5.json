  ],
  "summary": "Local Privilege Escalation in Windows",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to.\n\nA user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied:\n\n* The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`.\n* The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker).\n* The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location).\n* Either:\n  - The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between [`shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0fb18b02c8ad56299d6a2910be0bab8ad601ef24/Lib/shutil.py#L623) and the deletion itself\n  - The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pull/7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller \u003e= 5.13.1`\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nNo workaround, although the attack complexity becomes much higher if the application is built with Python \u003e= 3.8.0.",
