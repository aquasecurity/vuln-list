Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (d69af157f61ff28637034b3cb784df9d0c93481f481b86c320576c4dc9177ddf)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'omgd' @ 92.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
