Versions before 0.1.2 do not perform any active action.\n\nThe original umap package existed in the past, but was removed by the author. The last version was 0.1.1 published as a source package. Years later, the same name was registered by another user, who managed to publish a wheel package of version 0.1.1 as it's not prohibited to upload alternative build packages for existing versions. This hijacked version was an empty package. In 0.1.2, a beacon webhook was added. \n\nMore context: https://github.com/kam193/package-campaigns/issues/5\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n",
