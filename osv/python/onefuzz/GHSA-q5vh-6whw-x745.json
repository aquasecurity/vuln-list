  "summary": "Improper Authorization and Origin Validation Error in OneFuzz",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nStarting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance.\n\nTo be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be:\n* Version 2.12.0 or greater\n* Deployed with the non-default [`--multi_tenant_domain`](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/blob/2.30.0/src/deployment/deploy.py#L1021) option\n\nThis can result in read/write access to private data such as:\n* Software vulnerability and crash information\n* Security testing tools\n* Proprietary code and symbols\n\nVia authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance \u003c 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.\n\n## References\n\nYou can find an overview of the Microsoft Identity Platform [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview).  This vulnerability applies to the multi-tenant application pattern, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant).\n\n## For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [OneFuzz](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz)\n* Email us at [fuzzing@microsoft.com](mailto:fuzzing@microsoft.com)",
