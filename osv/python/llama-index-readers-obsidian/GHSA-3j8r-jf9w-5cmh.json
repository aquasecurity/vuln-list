  "summary": "LlamaIndex vulnerability in its ObsidianReader class can lead to Path Traversal exploit",
  "details": "A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, before version 0.5.2 (specifically in version 0.12.27 of llama-index), allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd, by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in llama-index-readers-obsidian version 0.5.2.",
