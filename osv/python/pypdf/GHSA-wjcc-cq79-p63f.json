  "summary": "Possible Infinite Loop when PdfWriter(clone_from) is used with a PDF",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop.\nThis infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage.\n\nThat is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was fixed with #2264\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot update your version of pypdf, you should modify `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` just like #2264 did.",
