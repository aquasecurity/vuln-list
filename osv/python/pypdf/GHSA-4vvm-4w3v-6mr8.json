  ],
  "summary": "pypdf and PyPDF2 possible Infinite Loop when a comment isn't followed by a character",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF.\n\nExample Code and a PDF that causes the issue:\n\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader\n\n# https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-repository-file-5c1aeb/3119517/11367871?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20230627%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20230627T201018Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=300\u0026X-Amz-Signature=d71c8fd9181c4875f0c04d563b6d32f1d4da6e7b2e6be2f14479ce4ecdc9c8b2\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026actor_id=1658117\u0026key_id=0\u0026repo_id=3119517\u0026response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DMiFO_LFO_FEIS_NOA_Published.3.pdf\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fpdf\nreader = PdfReader(\"MiFO_LFO_FEIS_NOA_Published.3.pdf\")\npage = reader.pages[0]\npage.extract_text()\n```\n\nThe issue was introduced with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/969\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was fixed with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1828\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt is recommended to upgrade to `pypdf\u003e=3.9.0`. PyPDF2 users should migrate to pypdf.\n\nIf you cannot update your version of pypdf, you should modify `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`:\n\n```\nOLD: while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\"):\nNEW: while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\", b\"\"):\n```",
