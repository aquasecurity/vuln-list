  "summary": "BlackSheep's ClientSession is vulnerable to CRLF injection",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe HTTP Client implementation in BlackSheep is vulnerable to CRLF injection. Missing headers validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP requests (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request.\nExploitation requires developers to pass unsanitized user input directly into headers.\nThe server part is not affected because BlackSheep delegates to an underlying ASGI server handling of response headers.\n\n**Attack vector:** Applications using user input in HTTP client requests (method, URL, headers).\n\n### Patches\nUsers who use the HTTP Client in BlackSheep should upgrade to `2.4.6`.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf users handle headers from untrusted parties, they might reject values for header names and values that contain carriage returns.\n\n### References\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection",
