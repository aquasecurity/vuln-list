Later the behaviour was changed and looks like being a toolkit to install malware, yet, depending on version, containing an automated infostealer installation. The exact code is partially hidden behind different obfuscation methods.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-pojang-resorter\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - infostealer\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n\n - \n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote executable.\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - exfiltration-generic\n",
