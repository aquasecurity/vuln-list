  ],
  "summary": "Rebuild-bot workflow may allow unauthorised repository modifications",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the \"main\" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit to the \"main\" repository.\n\nThe rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made).\n\nRepositories that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was mitigated in version `0.16.41` of the `projen` tool, which removes the `issue_comment` trigger from this workflow. Version `0.17.0` of projen completely removes the `rebuild-bot.yml` workflow.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe recommended way to address the vulnerability is to upgrade `projen`. Users who cannot upgrade `projen` may also remove the `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` file and add it to their `.gitignore` file (via `projenrc.js`) to mitigate the issue.\n\n### References\n\nThe `rebuild-bot.yml` workflow managed by `projen` is only one occurrence of a GitHub Workflows mis-configuration, but it may also be present in other workflows not managed by `projen` (either hand-written, or managed by other tools). For more information on this class of issues, the [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Preventing pwn requests][1] article provides a great overview of the problem.\n \n\n[1]: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests",
