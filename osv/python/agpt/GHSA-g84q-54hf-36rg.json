  "summary": "AutoGPT bypass of the shell commands denylist settings",
  "details": "A vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version 0.5.1 allows an attacker to bypass the shell commands denylist settings. The issue arises when the denylist is configured to block specific commands, such as `whoami` and `/bin/whoami`. An attacker can circumvent this restriction by executing commands with a modified path, such as `/bin/./whoami`, which is not recognized by the denylist.",
