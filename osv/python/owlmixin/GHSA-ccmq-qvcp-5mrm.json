  "summary": "Unsafe deserialization in owlmixin",
  "details": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML loading functionality of util.py in OwlMixin before 2.0.0a12. A \"Load YAML\" string or file (aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.",
