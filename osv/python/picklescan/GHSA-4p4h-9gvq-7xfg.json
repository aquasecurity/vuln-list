  "details": "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-93mv-x874-956g. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nThe unsafe globals in Picklescan before 0.0.25 do not include ssl. Consequently, ssl.get_server_certificate can exfiltrate data via DNS after deserialization.",
