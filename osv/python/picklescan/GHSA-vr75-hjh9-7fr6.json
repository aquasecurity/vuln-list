  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-655q-fx9r-782v. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\npicklescan before 0.0.21 does not treat 'pip' as an unsafe global. An attacker could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package (hosted, for example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`. Because pip is not a restricted global, the model, when scanned with picklescan, would pass security checks and appear to be safe, when it could instead prove to be problematic.",
