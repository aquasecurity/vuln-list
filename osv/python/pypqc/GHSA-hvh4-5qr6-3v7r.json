  "details": "### Impact\n`kyber512`, `kyber768`, and `kyber1024` on Mac OS \\(or when compiled with clang\\) only: An attacker able to submit many decapsulation requests against a single private key, and to gain timing information about the decapsulation, could recover the private key. Proof-of-concept exploit exists for a local attacker.\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:C  \n\n### Patches\nNo patch is currently available / pending upstream [PQClean#556](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/556).\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds have been reported. The 0.0.7 -\u003e 0.0.7.1 upgrade, when available, should be a drop-in replacement\u003c!--; it has no known breaking changes--\u003e.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/\n\nhttps://github.com/antoonpurnal/clangover\n\nhttps://www.github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/556\n\nhttps://www.github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/9b8d30698a3e7449aeb34e62339d4176f11e3c6c",
