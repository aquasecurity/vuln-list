  "summary": "pypqc private key retrieval vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nFor `kyber512`, `kyber768`, and `kyber1024` only: An attacker able to submit many ciphertexts against a single private key, and to get responses in real-time, could recover the private key. This attack has been named KyberSlash\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.0.6.1 and newer of PyPQC is patched.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds have been reported. The 0.0.6 -\u003e 0.0.6.1 upgrade should be a drop-in replacement; it has no known breaking changes.\n\n### References\n1.
