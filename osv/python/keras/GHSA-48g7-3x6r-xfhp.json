  "summary": "Arbitrary Code Execution via Crafted Keras Config for Model Loading",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe Keras `Model.load_model` function permits arbitrary code execution, even with `safe_mode=True`, through a manually constructed, malicious `.keras` archive. By altering the `config.json` file within the archive, an attacker can specify arbitrary Python modules and functions, along with their arguments, to be loaded and executed during model loading.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is fixed starting with version `3.9`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOnly load models from trusted sources and model archives created with Keras.\n\n### References\n\n- https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-1550\n- https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/20751",
