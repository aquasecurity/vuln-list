  "summary": "Keras framework vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data",
  "details": "Deserialization of untrusted data can occur in versions of the Keras framework running versions 3.11.0 up to but not including 3.11.3, enabling a maliciously uploaded Keras file containing a TorchModuleWrapper class to run arbitrary code on an end user’s system when loaded despite safe mode being enabled. The vulnerability can be triggered through both local and remote files.",
