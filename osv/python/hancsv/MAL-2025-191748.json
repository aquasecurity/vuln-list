The script collects information about the host (including e.g. startup applications) and also downloads the next stage executable. \n\nWhile the package contains a security disclaimer, the behaviour is still malicious and crosses the researching line.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-06-hancsv\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote executable.\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username.
