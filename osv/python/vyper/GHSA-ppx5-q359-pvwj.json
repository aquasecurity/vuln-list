  "summary": "vyper's range(start, start + N) reverts for negative numbers",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nWhen looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert.\n \n### Details\n\nThis issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range (`stmt.parse_For_range()`):\n\nhttps://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba/vyper/codegen/stmt.py#L286-L287\n\nThis assertion was introduced in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868 to fix https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. \n### PoC\n\n```Vyper\n@external\ndef foo():\n    x:int256 = min_value(int256)\n    # revert when it should not since we have the following assertion that fails:\n    # [assert, [le, min_value(int256), max_value(int256) + 1 - 10]],\n    for i in range(x, x + 10):\n        pass\n```\n\n### Patches\n\npatched in v0.4.0, specifically, https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3679 disallows this form of `range()`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert.",
