  "summary": "Vyper sha3 codegen bug",
  "details": "### Summary\nThere is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated.\nThe vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand. That is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code, it can only be triggered by using the `fang` binary directly (this binary used to be called `vyper-ir` prior to v0.3.4).\n\n### Details\nTo compile `sha3_64`, the `arg[0]` and `arg[1]` have to be compiled:\nhttps://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586\n\nAs can be seen, after compiling the 0th arg, the `height` variable isn't increased. If new `withargs` are defined in the inner scope, they are manipulated correctly, because both their `height` is off and also the global `height` is off and thus their placement on the stack is computed correctly.\n\n`sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found, the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`.\n\n### PoC\nSuppose the following hand-written IR:\n```lisp\n(with _loc\n\t(with val 1 \n\t\t(with key 2 \n\t\t\t(sha3_64 val key))) \n\t\t\t\t(seq \n\t\t\t\t\t(sstore _loc \n\t\t\t\t\t(with x (sload _loc) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t(with ans (add x 1) (seq (assert (ge ans x)) ans))))))\n```\nafter compilation:\n```\nthe generated bytecode: 6001600281806020525f5260405f2090509050805460018101818110610026579050815550005b5f80fd\n\n0000    60  PUSH1 0x01\n0002    60  PUSH1 0x02\n0004    81  DUP2\n0005    80  DUP1       *********** bad code here!!!!!!\n0006    60  PUSH1 0x20\n0008    52  MSTORE\n```\n\nIt can be seen that the second `DUP` will dup the item on the top of the stack which is incorrect.\n\n### Impact\nVersions v0.2.0-v0.3.10 were evaluated, and access of the variable with the invalid height is not reachable from IR generated by the vyper front-end. Because the issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code, the impact is considered low.\n",
