  "summary": "CVE-2025-24357 Malicious model remote code execution fix bypass with PyTorch \u003c 2.6.0",
  "details": "## Description\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-rh4j-5rhw-hr54 reported a vulnerability where loading a malicious model could result in code execution on the vllm host. The fix applied to specify `weights_only=True` to calls to `torch.load()` did not solve the problem prior to PyTorch 2.6.0.\n\nPyTorch has issued a new CVE about this problem: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6\n\nThis means that versions of vLLM using PyTorch before 2.6.0 are vulnerable to this problem.\n## Background Knowledge\nWhen users install VLLM according to the official manual\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d17e0bdb-26f2-46d6-adf6-0b17e5ddf5c7)\n\nBut the version of PyTorch is specified in the requirements. txt file\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94aad622-ad6d-4741-b772-c342727c58c7)\n\nSo by default when the user install VLLM, it will install the PyTorch with version 2.5.1\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04ff31b0-aad1-490a-963d-00fda91da47b)\n\nIn CVE-2025-24357, weights_only=True was used for patching, but we know this is not secure.\nBecause we found that using Weights_only=True in pyTorch before 2.5.1 was unsafe\n\nHere, we use this interface to prove that it is not safe.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d86efcd-2aad-42a2-8ac6-cc96b054c925)\n\n\n## Fix\nupdate PyTorch version to 2.6.0\n\n## Credit\nThis vulnerability was found By Ji'an Zhou and Li'shuo Song",
