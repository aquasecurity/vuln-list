  "summary": "vLLM affected by RCE via auto_map dynamic module loading during model initialization",
  "details": "# Summary\n\nvLLM loads Hugging Face `auto_map` dynamic modules during model resolution **without gating on `trust_remote_code`**, allowing attacker-controlled Python code in a model repo/path to execute at server startup.\n\n---\n\n# Impact\n\nAn attacker who can influence the model repo/path (local directory or remote Hugging Face repo) can achieve **arbitrary code execution** on the vLLM host during model load.  \nThis happens **before any request handling** and does **not require API access**.\n\n---\n\n# Affected Versions\n\nAll versions where `vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py` resolves `auto_map` entries with `try_get_class_from_dynamic_module` **without checking `trust_remote_code`** (at least current `main`).\n\n---\n\n# Details\n\nDuring model resolution, vLLM unconditionally iterates `auto_map` entries from the model config and calls `try_get_class_from_dynamic_module`, which delegates to Transformers’ `get_class_from_dynamic_module` and **executes the module code**.\n\nThis occurs even when `trust_remote_code` is `false`, allowing a malicious model repo to embed code in a referenced module and have it executed during initialization.\n\n### Relevant code\n\n- `vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py:856` — auto_map resolution  \n- `vllm/transformers_utils/dynamic_module.py:13` — delegates to `get_class_from_dynamic_module`, which executes code\n\n---\n\n# Fixes\n\n* https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32194\n\n# Credits\n\nReported by **bugbunny.ai**",
