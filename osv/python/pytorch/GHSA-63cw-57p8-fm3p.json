  "summary": "PyTorch Vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Untrusted Checkpoint Files",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA vulnerability in PyTorch's `weights_only` unpickler allows an attacker to craft a malicious checkpoint file (`.pth`) that, when loaded with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`, can corrupt memory and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\nThe `weights_only=True` unpickler failed to properly validate pickle opcodes and storage metadata, allowing:\n\n1. **Heap memory corruption** via `SETITEM`/`SETITEMS` opcodes applied to non-dictionary types\n2. **Storage size mismatch** between declared element count and actual data in the archive\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker who can convince a user to load a malicious checkpoint file may achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's process.\n\n\n# Credit\nJi'an Zhou",
