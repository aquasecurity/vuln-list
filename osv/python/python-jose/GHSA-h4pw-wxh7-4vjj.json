  "details": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-cjwg-qfpm-7377. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nIn python-jose 3.3.0 (specifically jwe.decrypt), a vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with an exceptionally high compression ratio. When this token is processed by the server, it results in significant memory allocation and processing time during decompression.",
