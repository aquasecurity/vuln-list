Package targets a typo in the Binance documentation:  https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python/blob/f1703c54c3059423a8568b2300597210b19b938e/clients/rebate/docs/migration_guide_rebate_sdk.md\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\n\n\nCampaign: GENERIC-standard-pypi-install-pentest\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n",
