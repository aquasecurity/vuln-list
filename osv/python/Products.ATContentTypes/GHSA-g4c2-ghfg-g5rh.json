  "summary": "Cross-site Scripting and Open Redirect in Products.ATContentTypes",
  "details": "### Impact\nPlone is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish.\nThe technique is known as cache poisoning.\nAny later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page.\nUsually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on your cache settings.\n\n### Patches\nA new version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix.\nThis version works on Plone 5.2 (Python 2 only) and will be included in Plone 5.2.7.\n\nNote that the Products.CMFPlone package has the same problem in the 4.3 series.\n`plone.app.contenttypes` has the same problem in all versions, see [advisory](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/security/advisories/GHSA-f7qw-5fgj-247x).\nFor all unpatched versions of the three packages, you can use the following workaround.\n\n### Workaround\nMake sure the image_view_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache.\nIn Plone:\n\n* Login as Manager and go to Site Setup.\n* Go to the 'Caching' control panel. If this does not exist, or 'Enable caching' is not checked, you should normally not be vulnerable.\n* Click on the tab 'Caching operations'.\n* Under 'Legacy template mappings' locate the ruleset 'Content item view'.\n* From the last column ('Templates')  remove 'image_view_fullscreen'.\n* Click on Save.\n\n### Reporter\nThis vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the Plone Security Team by Gustav Hansen, F-Secure Consulting. Thank you!\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@plone.org](mailto:security@plone.org)\nThis is also the correct address to use when you want to report a possible vulnerability.\nSee [our security report policy](https://plone.org/security/report).",
