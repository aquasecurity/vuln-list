  "summary": "Eventlet affected by HTTP request smuggling in unparsed trailers",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe Eventlet WSGI parser is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer sections.\n\nThis vulnerability could enable attackers to:\n- Bypass front-end security controls\n- Launch targeted attacks against active site users\n- Poison web caches\n\n### Patches\nProblem has been patched in eventlet 0.40.3.\n\nThe patch just drops trailers. If a backend behind eventlet.wsgi proxy requires trailers, then this patch BREAKS your setup.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use eventlet.wsgi facing untrusted clients.\n\n### References\n- Patch https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/pull/1062\n- This issue is similar to https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9548-qrrj-x5pj",
