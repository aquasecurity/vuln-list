  "summary": "Issue with Amazon Redshift Python Connector and the BrowserAzureOAuth2CredentialsProvider plugin",
  "details": "### Summary\n[Amazon Redshift Python Connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/python-redshift-driver.html) is a pure Python connector to Redshift (i.e., driver) that implements the [Python Database API Specification 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/).\n\nWhen the Amazon Redshift Python Connector is configured with the BrowserAzureOAuth2CredentialsProvider plugin, the driver skips the SSL certificate validation step for the Identity Provider. \n\n### Impact\n\nAn insecure connection could allow an actor to intercept the token exchange process and retrieve an access token.\n\n**Impacted versions:** \u003e=2.0.872;\u003c=2.1.6\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade Amazon Redshift Python Connector to version 2.1.7 and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page [1] or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com). Please do not create a public GitHub issue.\n\n[1] Vulnerability reporting page: https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting",
