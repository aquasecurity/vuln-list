  "summary": "Username spoofing in OnionShare",
  "details": "Between September 26, 2021 and October 8, 2021, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a penetration test of OnionShare 2.4, funded by the Open Technology Fund's [Red Team lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/). This is an issue from that penetration test.\n\n- Vulnerability ID: OTF-005\n- Vulnerability type: Improper Input Sanitization\n- Threat level: Low\n\n## Description:\n\nIt is possible to change the username to that of another chat participant with an additional space character at the end of the name string.\n\n## Technical description:\n\nAssumed users in Chat:\n\n- Alice\n- Bob\n- Mallory\n\n1. Mallory renames to `Alice `.\n2. Mallory sends message as `Alice `.\n3. Alice and Bob receive a message from Mallory disguised as `Alice `, which is hard to distinguish from the `Alice`\nin the web interface.\n\n![otf-005-a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156128/140666112-8febd4d8-6761-41aa-955c-48be76f3c657.png)\n![otf-005-b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156128/140666113-1713ddf7-cef6-4dac-b718-9af1dc4ffdcd.png)\n\nOther (invisible) whitespace characters were found to be working as well.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with access to the chat environment can use the rename feature to impersonate other participants by adding whitespace characters at the end of the username.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Remove non-visible characters from the username",
