  "summary": "Possible XSS attack in Wagtail",
  "details": "### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on the page revision comparison view within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).\n\n### Workarounds\nSite owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable the revision comparison view by adding the following URL route to the top of their project's `urls.py` configuration:\n\n    from django.views.generic.base import RedirectView\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        url(r'^admin/pages/(\\d+)/revisions/compare/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/admin/')),\n        # ...\n    ]\n\n### Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to Vlad Gerasimenko for reporting this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Visit Wagtail's [support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html)\n* Email us at [security@wagtail.io](mailto:security@wagtail.io) (if you wish to send encrypted email, the public key ID is `0x6ba1e1a86e0f8ce8`)",
