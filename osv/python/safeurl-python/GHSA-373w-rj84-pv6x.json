  "summary": "SafeURL-Python's hostname blocklist does not block FQDNs",
  "details": "### Description\nIf a hostname was blacklisted, it was possible to bypass the blacklist by requesting the FQDN of the host (e.g. adding `.` to the end).\n\n### Impact\nThe main purpose of this library is to block requests to internal/private IPs and these cannot be bypassed using this finding. But if a library user had specifically set certain hostnames as blocked, then an attacker would be able to circumvent that block to cause SSRFs to request those hostnames.\n\n### Patches\nFixed by https://github.com/IncludeSecurity/safeurl-python/pull/6\n\n### Credit\nhttps://github.com/Sim4n6\n",
