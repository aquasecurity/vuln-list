  "summary": "CodeChecker has a buffer overflow in the log command",
  "details": "### Summary\nCodeChecker versions up to 6.26.1 contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in the internal `ldlogger` library, which is executed by the `CodeChecker log` command.\n\n### Details\nUnsafe usage of `strcpy()` function in the internal `ldlogger` library allows attackers to trigger a buffer overflow by supplying crafted inputs from the command line. Specifically, the destination buffer is stack-allocated with a fixed size of 4096 bytes, while `strcpy()` is called without any length checks, enabling an attacker to overrun the buffer.\n\n### PoC\nExample script is included below to illustrate how this vulnerability can be exploited.\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport CC_LOGGER_DEF_DIRS=1; \npayload=''; for i in $(seq 1 4090); do payload+='A'; done\n\nCodeChecker log -b \"/very/long/path/to/$payload/gcc a.c\" -o compilation.json\n```\n\n### Impact\nAny environment where the vulnerable `CodeChecker log` command is executed with untrusted user input is affected by this vulnerability.",
