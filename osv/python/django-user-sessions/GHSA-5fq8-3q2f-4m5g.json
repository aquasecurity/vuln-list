  "summary": "Session key exposure through session list in Django User Sessions",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe views provided by django-user-sessions allow users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the attacker and a session takeover could happen.\n\n### Patches\nPatch is under way.\n\n### Workarounds\nRemove the session_key from the template.\n\n### References\n_None._\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Bouke/django-user-sessions](https://github.com/Bouke/django-user-sessions/issues)\n* Email us at [bouke@haarsma.eu](mailto:bouke@haarsma.eu)",
