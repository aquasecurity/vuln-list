  "summary": "Improper Authorization in cobbler",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIf PAM is correctly configured and a user account is set to expired, the expired user-account is still able to successfully log into Cobbler in all places (Web UI, CLI \u0026 XMLRPC-API).\n\nThe same applies to user accounts with passwords set to be expired.\n\n### Patches\n\nThere is a patch for the latest Cobbler `3.3.2` available, however a backport will be done for `3.2.x`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Delete expired accounts which are able to access Cobbler via PAM.\n- Use `chage -l \u003cusername\u003e` to lock the account. If the account has SSH-Keys attached then remove them completely.\n\n### References\n\n- Originally discovered by @ysf at https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/c458b868-63df-414e-af10-47e3745caa1d/\n\n### How to test if my Cobbler instance is affected?\n\nThe following `pytest` test assumes that your PAM setup is correct. In case the added user is not able to login, this test does not make sense to be executed.\n\n```python\ndef test_pam_login_with_expired_user():\n    # Arrange\n    # create pam testuser\n    test_username = \"expired_user\"\n    test_password = \"password\"\n    test_api = CobblerAPI()\n    subprocess_1 = subprocess.run(\n        [\"perl\", \"-e\", \"'print crypt(\\\"%s\\\", \\\"%s\\\")'\" % (test_username, test_password)],\n        stdout=subprocess.PIPE\n    )\n    subprocess.run([\"useradd\", \"-p\", subprocess_1.stdout, test_username])\n    # change user to be expired\n    subprocess.run([\"chage\", \"-E0\", test_username])\n\n    # Act\n    result = pam.authenticate(test_api, test_username, test_password)\n\n    # Assert - login should fail\n    assert not result\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Cobbler repository](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/new/choose)\n* Ask in the [Gitter/Matrix Chat](https://gitter.im/cobbler/community)\n* Email us at [cobbler.project@gmail.com](mailto:cobbler.project@gmail.com)\n",
