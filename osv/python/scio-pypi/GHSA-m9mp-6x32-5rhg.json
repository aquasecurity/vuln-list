  "details": "### Impact\nPyTorch reported a [**critical** vulnerability](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/advisories/GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6) when using `torch.load`, even with option `weights_only=True`, for `torch \u003c= 2.5.1`.\n\nIn `scio \u003c= 1.0.0`, the lower bound for `torch` is `2.3`.\n\n### Patches\nThe lower bound was changed to `torch \u003e= 2.6`, starting from `scio \u003e= 1.0.1` (currently in dev state).\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can manually check that you are using `torch \u003e= 2.6`.",
