  "summary": "PyPDF2 vulnerable to possible Infinite Loop when reading malformed objects",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop.\nThis infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted metadata from such a malformed PDF.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was fixed with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot update your version of `PyPDF2` (preferably to `pypdf\u003e3.1.0` as PyPDF2 is deprecated), you should modify `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py::read_object`.\n\nReplace:\n\n```python\n    else:\n        # number object OR indirect reference\n        peek = stream.read(20)\n        stream.seek(-len(peek), 1)  # reset to start\n        if IndirectPattern.match(peek) is not None:\n            return IndirectObject.read_from_stream(stream, pdf)\n        else:\n            return NumberObject.read_from_stream(stream)\n```\n\nby\n\n```python\n    elif tok in b\"0123456789+-.\":\n        # number object OR indirect reference\n        peek = stream.read(20)\n        stream.seek(-len(peek), 1)  # reset to start\n        if IndirectPattern.match(peek) is not None:\n            return IndirectObject.read_from_stream(stream, pdf)\n        else:\n            return NumberObject.read_from_stream(stream)\n    else:\n        raise PdfReadError(\n            f\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with {tok} @{stream.tell()}\"\n        )\n```\n\n### References\n* [pypdf issue #1329](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/1329)\n* [pypdf PR #1331](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331)",
