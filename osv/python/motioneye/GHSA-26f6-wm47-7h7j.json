  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-j945-qm58-4gjx. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nMotionEye v0.43.1b4 and before is vulnerable to OS Command Injection in configuration parameters such as image_file_name. Unsanitized user input is written to Motion configuration files, allowing remote authenticated attackers with admin access to achieve code execution when Motion is restarted.",
