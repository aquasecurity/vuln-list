  "summary": "Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP) client library for Python vulnerable to Trust Boundary Violation through Manual JSON specification",
  "details": "The vulnerability arises when a client fetches a tools’ JSON specification, known as a Manual, from a remote Manual Endpoint. While a provider may initially serve a benign manual (e.g., one defining an HTTP tool call), earning the clients’ trust, a malicious provider can later change the manual to exploit the client.",
