  "summary": "badkeys vulnerable to ASCII control character injection on console via malformed input",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker may inject content with ASCII control characters like vertical tabs, ANSI escape sequences, etc., that can create misleading output of the `badkeys` command-line tool. This impacts scanning DKIM keys (both `--dkim` and `--dkim-dns`), SSH keys (`--ssh-lines` mode), and filenames in various modes.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed with the following commits:\nhttps://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/de631f69f040974bb5fb442cdab9a1d904c64087\nhttps://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/commit/635a2f3b1b50a895d8b09ec8629efc06189f349a\n\nAll users should upgrade `badkeys` to version 0.0.16.\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://github.com/badkeys/badkeys/issues/40",
