  "summary": "PyOpenSSL Use-After-Free vulnerability",
  "details": "It was discovered that pyOpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when handling X509 objects. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause pyOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This attack appears to be exploitable via Depends on the calling application and if it retains a reference to the memory. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 17.5.0.",
