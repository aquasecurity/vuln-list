They are identified as malicious by VT and the tracks of Telegram URLs suggests attempting data exfiltration. The package itself looks like a copy of requests.\nIn flophttp, using exactly the same obfuscation method, the infostealer is directly embeded into package code and exfiltrates data to a telegram channel.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2024-08-invokehttp\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - infostealer\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote executable.\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n",
