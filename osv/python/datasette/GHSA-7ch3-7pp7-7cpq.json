  "summary": "Datasette 1.0 alpha series leaks names of databases and tables to unauthenticated users",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0 alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords).\n\nThe `/-/api` API explorer endpoint could reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents - to an unauthenticated user.\n\n### Patches\n\nDatasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo work around this issue, block all traffic to the `/-/api` endpoint. This can be done with a proxy such as Apache or NGINX, or by installing the [datasette-block](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-block) plugin and adding the following configuration to your `metadata.json` or `metadata.yml` file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"plugins\": {\n        \"datasette-block\": {\n            \"prefixes\": [\"/-/api\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will block access to the API explorer but will still allow access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use different URL patterns within the Datasette `/database` hierarchy.",
