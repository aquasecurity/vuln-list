  "details": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can cause a floating point exception by calling inplace operations with crafted arguments that would result in a division by 0. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/inplace_ops.cc#L283) has a logic error: it should skip processing if `x` and `v` are empty but the code uses `||` instead of `\u0026\u0026`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit e86605c0a336c088b638da02135ea6f9f6753618. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
