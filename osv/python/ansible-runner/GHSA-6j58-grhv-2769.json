  "summary": "ansible-runner vulnerable to shell command injection",
  "details": "A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the `ansible_runner.interface.run_command`, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.",
