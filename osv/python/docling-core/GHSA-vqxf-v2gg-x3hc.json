  "summary": "docling-core vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via unsafe PyYAML usage",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA PyYAML-related Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, namely CVE-2020-14343, is exposed in `docling-core \u003e=2.21.0, \u003c2.48.4` and, specifically only if the application uses `pyyaml \u003c 5.4` and invokes `docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument.load_from_yaml()` passing it untrusted YAML data.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in `docling-core` version **2.48.4**.\nThe fix mitigates the issue by switching `PyYAML` deserialization from `yaml.FullLoader` to `yaml.SafeLoader`, ensuring that untrusted data cannot trigger code execution.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers who cannot immediately upgrade `docling-core` can alternatively ensure that the installed version of `PyYAML` is **5.4 or greater**, which supposedly patches CVE-2020-14343.\n\n### References\n\n* GitHub Issue: #482\n* Upstream Advisory: CVE-2020-14343\n* Fix Release: [v2.48.4](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/releases/tag/v2.48.4)",
