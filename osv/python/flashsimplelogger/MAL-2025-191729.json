This makes a few checks and downloads the next stage, which is a code obfuscated with PyArmor with unclear behaviour.\n\nThe way the malicious code has been embedded could be called a \"sophisticated\" threat. The code is in the _logger.py in two places: the payload in L2242 as a long string constraint of only whitespaces, which are then transformed into bits and bytes, and later compiled and executed using \"types.FunctionType\" during initialisation of Core class.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2025-07-loquru\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - clones-real-package\n\n\n - Downloads and executes a remote malicious script.\n",
