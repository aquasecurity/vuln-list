  "summary": "markdown2 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in `markdown2` (aka python-markdown2) through 2.3.5. The `safe_mode` feature, which is supposed to sanitize user input against XSS, is flawed and does not escape the input properly. With a crafted payload, XSS can be triggered, as demonstrated by omitting the final `\u003e` character from an IMG tag.",
