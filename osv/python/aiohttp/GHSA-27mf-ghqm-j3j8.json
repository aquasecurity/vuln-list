  "summary": "aiohttp has a memory leak when middleware is enabled when requesting a resource with a non-allowed method",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA memory leak can occur when a request produces a `MatchInfoError`. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each `MatchInfoError` producing a unique cache entry.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf the user is making use of any middlewares with `aiohttp.web` then it is advisable to upgrade immediately.\n\nAn attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/bc15db61615079d1b6327ba42c682f758fa96936",
