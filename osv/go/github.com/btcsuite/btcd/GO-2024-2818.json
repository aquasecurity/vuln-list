  "summary": "Consensus failures in github.com/btcsuite/btcd",
  "details": "Incorrect implementation of the consensus rules outlined in BIP 68 and BIP 112 making btcd susceptible to consensus failures. Specifically, it uses the transaction version as a signed integer when it is supposed to be treated as unsigned. There can be a chain split and loss of funds.",
