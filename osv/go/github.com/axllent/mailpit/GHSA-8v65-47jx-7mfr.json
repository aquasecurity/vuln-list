  "summary": "Mailpit Proxy Endpoint has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nA Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in Mailpit's `/proxy` endpoint that allows attackers to make requests to internal network resources.\n\n\n## Description\n\nThe `/proxy` endpoint allows requests to internal network resources. While it validates `http://` and `https://` schemes, it does not block internal IP addresses, allowing attackers to access internal services and APIs.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Basic SSRF Request\n```\nGET /proxy?url=http://127.0.0.1:8025/api/v1/info\n```\n\nThis returns internal API data including database path and runtime statistics.\n \n## Impact Assessment\n\n### 1. Internal Network Scanning\nAttacker can probe and discover internal services on the network.\n\n### 2. Information Disclosure\nAccess to internal API data, database paths, and runtime statistics.\n\n### 3. Email Content Access\nAbility to read all captured emails via internal API endpoints.\n\n### 4. Cloud Metadata Access\nIf deployed in cloud environments (AWS/GCP/Azure), potential access to instance metadata services (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`).\n\n## Attack Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Development Environment Exposure\nIf Mailpit is accidentally exposed to the internet, attackers can leverage SSRF to access internal development resources and services.\n\n### Scenario 2: Container Escape Information\nIn containerized deployments, SSRF can reveal container metadata and internal service configurations.\n\n### Scenario 3: Lateral Movement\nIn corporate networks, SSRF can be used to discover and interact with internal services, facilitating lateral movement.\n\n## Mitigating Factors\nThis vulnerability is limited to HTTP GET requests with minimal headers. Additionally, Mailpit's web UI \u0026 API should be protected by basic authentication when exposed to the internet, which prevents access to the proxy endpoint. \n\n## References\n\n- [MDN Web Security - SSRF Attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/SSRF)\n- [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n- [OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)",
