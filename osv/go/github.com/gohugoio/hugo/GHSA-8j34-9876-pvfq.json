  "summary": "Hugo can execute a binary from the current directory on Windows",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nHugo depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. However, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.\n\nWindows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected.\n\n## Patches\nUsers should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1.",
