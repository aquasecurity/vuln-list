  "summary": "http-swagger XSS via PUT requests",
  "details": "http-swagger before 1.2.6 allows XSS via PUT requests, because a file that has been uploaded (via httpSwagger.WrapHandler and *webdav.memFile) can subsequently be accessed via a GET request. NOTE: this is independently fixable with respect to CVE-2022-24863, because (if a solution continued to allow PUT requests) large files could have been blocked without blocking JavaScript, or JavaScript could have been blocked without blocking large files.",
