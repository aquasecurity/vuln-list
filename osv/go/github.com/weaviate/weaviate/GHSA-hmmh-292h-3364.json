  "summary": "Weaviate OSS has path traversal vulnerability via the Shard Movement API",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in Weaviate OSS before 1.33.4. Due to a lack of validation of the fileName field in the transfer logic, an attacker who can call the GetFile method while a shard is in the \"Pause file activity\" state and the FileReplicationService is reachable can read arbitrary files accessible to the service process.",
