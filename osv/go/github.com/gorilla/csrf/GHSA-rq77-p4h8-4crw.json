  "summary": "gorilla/csrf CSRF vulnerability due to broken Referer validation",
  "details": "### Summary\n\ngorilla/csrf is vulnerable to CSRF via form submission from origins that share a top level domain with the target origin.\n\n### Details\n\ngorilla/csrf does not validate the Origin header against an allowlist. Its executes its validation of the Referer header for cross-origin requests only when it believes the request is being served over TLS. It determines this by inspecting the `r.URL.Scheme` value. However, this value is never populated for \"server\" requests [per the Go spec](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request), and so this check does not run in practice. \n```\n\t// URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server\n\t// requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).\n\t//\n\t// For server requests, the URL is parsed from the URI\n\t// supplied on the Request-Line as stored in RequestURI.  For\n\t// most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be\n\t// empty. (See [RFC 7230, Section 5.3](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230.html#section-5.3))\n\t//\n\t// For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to\n\t// connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally\n\t// specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP\n\t// request.\n\tURL *[url](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url).[URL](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#URL)\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n- create trusted origin `target.example.test` protected with gorilla/csrf and served over TLS hosting form on `/submit`\n- create attacker origin `attack.example.test` served over TLS\n- attacker exfiltrates token \u0026 cookie combination from `target.example.test` \n- attacker sets exfiltrated cookie with `domain=.example.test and path=/submit`\n  - as the cookie has a more specific path than `/` (the default for CSRF cookies) it will be sent first by the browser on submit to our target origin\n- submit form from `attack.example.test` with exfiltrated CSRF form token\n- observe valid form submission as `attack.example.test` Origin / Referer headers are not validated. \n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker who has gained XSS on a subdomain or top level domain to perform authenticated form submissions against gorilla/csrf protected targets that share the same top level domain.\n\nThis bug has existed in gorilla/csrf since its initial release in 2015.",
