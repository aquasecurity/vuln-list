  "summary": "WITHDRAWN: Directory traversal in FilesystemStore in github.com/gorilla/sessions",
  "details": "(This report has been withdrawn on the grounds that it generates too many false positives. Session IDs are documented as not being suitable to hold user-provided data.)\n\nFilesystemStore does not sanitize the Session.ID value, making it vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. If an attacker has control over the contents of the session ID, this can be exploited to write to arbitrary files in the filesystem.\n\nPrograms which do not set session IDs explicitly, or which only set session IDs that will not be interpreted by the filesystem, are not vulnerable.",
