  "summary": "go-tuf affected by client DoS via malformed server response",
  "details": "# Security Disclosure: Client DoS via malformed server response\n\n## Summary\n\nIf the TUF repository (or any of its mirrors) returns invalid TUF metadata JSON (valid JSON but not well formed TUF metadata), the client will panic _during parsing_, causing a DoS. The panic happens before any signature is validated. This means that a compromised repository/mirror/cache can DoS clients without having access to any signing key.\n\n## Impact \n\nClient crashes upon receiving and parsing malformed TUF metadata. This can cause long running services to enter an restart/crash loop.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nNone currently. \n\n## Affected code\n\nThe `metadata.checkType` function did not properly type assert the (untrusted) input causing it to panic on malformed data.",
