  ],
  "summary": "Drainage of FeeCollector's Block Transaction Fees in cronos",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn Cronos nodes running versions before v0.6.5, it is possible to take transaction fees from Cosmos SDK's FeeCollector for the current block by sending a custom crafted MsgEthereumTx.\n\nUser funds and balances are safe.\n\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in Cronos v0.6.5 on the mempool level.\nThe next network upgrade with consensus-breaking changes will patch it on the consensus level.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no tested workarounds. All validator node operators are recommended to upgrade to Cronos v0.6.5 at their earliest possible convenience.\n\n### Credits\nThank you to @zb3 for reporting this issue on [Cronos Immunefi Bug Bounty Program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/), to @cyril-crypto for reproducing the issue and to @yihuang and @thomas-nguy for patching the issue on the CheckTx (mempool) and the DeliverTx (consensus) levels.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a discussion in [crypto-org-chain/cronos](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/discussions/new)\n* Email us at [chain@crypto.org](mailto:chain@crypto.org)\n",
