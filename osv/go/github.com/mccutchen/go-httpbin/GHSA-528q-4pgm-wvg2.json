Visit one of the above mentioned URLs.\n2. XSS window will popup\n\n### Suggested fix\n- Allow Only Safe Content-Type Values Or give users option to define whitelisted Content-Type headers\n\n\n### Criticality\nThe following can be major impacts of the issue:\n* Access to victim's sensitive Personal Identifiable Information.\n* Access to CSRF token\n* Cookie injection\n* Phishing\n* And any other thing Javascript can perform",
