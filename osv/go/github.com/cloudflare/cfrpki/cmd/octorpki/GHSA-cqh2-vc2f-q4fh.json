  "summary": "Arbitrary filepath traversal via URI injection ",
  "details": "OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing \"..\", this allows a repository to create a file, (ex.  `rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa`), which would then be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow for remote code execution on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on. \n\n## Patches\n\n## For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at security@cloudflare.com\n",
