  "summary": "A failed upgrade may lead to hung goroutines",
  "details": "### Impact\nProcesses using tableflip may encounter hung goroutines in the parent process, after a failed upgrade.\n\nThe Go runtime has annoying behaviour around setting and clearing\nO_NONBLOCK: exec.Cmd.Start() ends up calling os.File.Fd() for any\nfile in exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles. os.File.Fd() disables both the use\nof the runtime poller for the file and clears O_NONBLOCK from\nthe underlying open file descriptor.\n\nThis can lead to goroutines hanging in a parent process, after at least\none failed upgrade. The bug manifests in goroutines which rely on\neither a deadline or interruption via Close() to be unblocked being stuck\nin read or accept like syscalls. As far as I can tell we've not experienced\nthis problem in production, so it's most likely quite rare.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in v1.2.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip/commit/cae714b289e199db5da5f08af861ea65be6232c0",
