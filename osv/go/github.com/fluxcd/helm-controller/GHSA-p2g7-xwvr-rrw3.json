  "summary": "Helm Controller denial of service",
  "details": "Helm controller is tightly integrated with the Helm SDK. [A vulnerability](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh) found in the Helm SDK allows for specific data inputs to cause high memory consumption, which in some platforms could cause the controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations.\n\n### Impact\nIn a shared cluster multi-tenancy environment, a tenant could create a HelmRelease that makes the controller panic, denying all other tenants from their Helm releases being reconciled.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe initial crash bug was reported by [oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz). The Flux Security team produced the first exploit and worked together with the Helm Security team to ensure that both projects were patched timely.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Open an issue in any of the affected repositories.\n- Contact us at the CNCF Flux Channel.\n\n### References\n\n- https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=48360\n- https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=44996\n- https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh\n",
