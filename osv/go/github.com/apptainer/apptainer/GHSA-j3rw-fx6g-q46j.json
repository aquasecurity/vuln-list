  "summary": "Apptainer ineffectively applies selinux and apparmor --security options",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn Apptainer versions less than 1.4.5, a container can disable two of the forms of the little used `--security` option, in particular the forms `--security=apparmor:\u003cprofile\u003e` and `--security=selinux:\u003clabel\u003e` which otherwise put restrictions on operations that containers can do.  The `--security` option has always been mentioned in Apptainer documentation as being a feature for the root user, although these forms do also work for unprivileged users on systems where the corresponding feature is enabled.  Apparmor is enabled by default on Debian-based distributions and SElinux is enabled by default on RHEL-based distributions, but on SUSE it depends on the distribution version.\n\nIn addition, a bug in the detection of selinux support in Apptainer's suid mode means that `--security selinux:\u003clabel\u003e` flags may not be applied, even in the absence of an attack.  In that case a warning message is emitted indicating that selinux is unavailable, but the warning may be may be overlooked, mis-interpreted, or not seen when apptainer is run from a script or other tool.  Failure to apply requested restrictions should result in a fatal error rather than just a warning message.\n\n### Patches\nIneffective write of selinux process labels is addressed via an update to the containers/selinux dependency in https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/pull/3226. That update brings in the upstream fix for https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm which was for a different but related vulnerability.\n\nIneffective write of apparmor process profiles is addressed in commit 4313b42.\n\nFailure to detect apparmor / selinux support, when --security flags are provided, is made an error rather than a warning in commit 82f1790.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds, other than to define system-wide apparmor / selinux policy for Apptainer itself. This would apply to all containers, not just those run with the `--security` flags, and could impact the operation of Apptainer itself.\n\n### References\nThanks to Sylabs for finding this issue, fixing it in https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-wwrx-w7c9-rf87 which was easy to import into Apptainer, and disclosing it early to the Apptainer project for a coordinated release.\n\nThe related upstream runc disclosure which inspired the investigation is https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrx-mc8f-2prm.",
