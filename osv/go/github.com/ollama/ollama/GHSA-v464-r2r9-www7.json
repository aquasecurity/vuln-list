  "summary": "Ollama Vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via Crafted GZIP",
  "details": "An Out-Of-Memory (OOM) vulnerability exists in the `ollama` server version 0.3.14. This vulnerability can be triggered when a malicious API server responds with a gzip bomb HTTP response, leading to the `ollama` server crashing. The vulnerability is present in the `makeRequestWithRetry` and `getAuthorizationToken` functions, which use `io.ReadAll` to read the response body. This can result in excessive memory usage and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.",
