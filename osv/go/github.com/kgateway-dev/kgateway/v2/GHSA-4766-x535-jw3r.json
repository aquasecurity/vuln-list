  "summary": "kgateway is missing xDS authorization",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nThe xDS interface in Kgateway versions 2.0.0 through 2.0.4 lacks authentication, allowing any client with unrestricted network access to the xDS port to retrieve potentially sensitive configuration data including certificate data, backend service information, routing rules, and cluster metadata.\n\n## Description\n\n### Impact\n\nKgateway xDS interface did not have authorization, so anonymous clients with unrestricted network access could gain access to the xDS data. This could expose sensitive information about your gateway configuration, certificate data, backend services, and routing topology to unauthorized parties.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to version 2.0.5 or 2.1.0. These versions enable JWT-based authentication for the xDS interface by default, ensuring that only authenticated clients can access the xDS configuration data.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf immediate upgrade is not possible, NetworkPolicies can be used to block access to kgateway's xDS port, restricting network access to only trusted sources.\n\n## References\n\n- Fix in 2.1.0: https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/pull/12471\n- Backport to 2.0.5: https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/pull/12535\n- Related issue: https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/issues/10651\n\n## Credits\n\nKindly reported by @rikatz\n\n## For More Information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out in slack https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C080D3PJMS4",
