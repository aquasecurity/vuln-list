  ],
  "summary": "vet MCP Server SSE Transport DNS Rebinding Vulnerability",
  "details": "SafeDep `vet` is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack due to lack of HTTP `Host` and `Origin` header validation. \n\nTo exploit this vulnerability following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A `vet` scan is executed and reports are saved as `sqlite3` database\n2. A `vet` MCP server is running on default port with SSE transport that has access to the report database\n3. The attacker lures the victim to attacker controlled website\n4. Attacker leverages DNS rebinding to access `vet` SSE server on `127.0.0.1` through the website\n5. Attacker uses MCP tools to read information from report database\n\n### Impact\n\nData from `vet` scan sqlite3 database may be exposed to remote attackers when `vet` is used as an MCP server in SSE mode with default ports through the sqlite3 query MCP tool.\n\n### Patches\n\n* `v1.12.5` is released that patches the issue with `Host` and `Origin` header allow list and validation\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Use `stdio` (default) transport for SSE server",
