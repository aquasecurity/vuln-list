  ],
  "summary": "Dragonfly incorrectly handles a task structure’s usedTrac field",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe processPieceFromSource method (figure 4.1) is part of a task processing mechanism. The method writes pieces of data to storage, updating a Task structure along the way. The method does not update the structure’s usedTraffic field, because an uninitialized variable n is used as a guard to the AddTraffic method call, instead of the result.Size variable.\n\n```golang\nvar n int64\nresult.Size, err = pt.GetStorage().WritePiece([skipped])\nresult.FinishTime = time.Now().UnixNano()\nif n \u003e 0 {\n       pt.AddTraffic(uint64(n))\n}\n```\n\nA task is processed by a peer. The usedTraffic metadata is not updated during the processing. Rate limiting is incorrectly applied, leading to a denial-of-service condition for the peer.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Trail of Bits, you can see the [full report](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com).",
