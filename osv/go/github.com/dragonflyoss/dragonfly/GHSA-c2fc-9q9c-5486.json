  "summary": "Dragonfly vulnerable to timing attacks against Proxy’s basic authentication",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe access control mechanism for the Proxy feature uses simple string comparisons and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker may try to guess the password one character at a time by sending all possible characters to a vulnerable mechanism and measuring the comparison instruction’s execution times.\nThe vulnerability is shown in figure 8.1, where both the username and password are compared with a short-circuiting equality operation.\n\n```golang\nif user != proxy.basicAuth.Username || pass != proxy.basicAuth.Password {\n```\n\nIt is currently undetermined what an attacker may be able to do with access to the proxy password.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Trail of Bits, you can see the [full report](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com).",
