  ],
  "summary": "containerd affected by a local privilege escalation via wide permissions on CRI directory",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn overly broad default permission vulnerability was found in containerd.\n\n- `/var/lib/containerd` was created with the permission bits 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n  - Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the metadata store and the content store\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri` was created with 0o755, while it should be created with 0o700\n  - Allowed local users on the host to potentially access the contents of Kubernetes local volumes. The contents of volumes might include setuid binaries, which could allow a local user on the host to elevate privileges on the host.\n- `/run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim` was created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700\n\nThe directory paths may differ depending on the daemon configuration.\nWhen the `temp` directory path is specified in the daemon configuration, that directory was also created with 0o711, while it should be created with 0o700.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in the following containerd versions:\n\n* 2.2.0\n* 2.1.5\n* 2.0.7\n* 1.7.29\n\nUsers should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\nThese updates automatically change the permissions of the existing directories.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e\n\u003e `/run/containerd` and `/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task` are still created with 0o711.\n\u003e This is an expected behavior for supporting userns-remapped containers.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe system administrator on the host can manually chmod the directories to not \nhave group or world accessible permisisons:\n\n```\nchmod 700 /var/lib/containerd\nchmod 700 /run/containerd/io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\nchmod 700 /run/containerd/io.containerd.sandbox.controller.v1.shim\n```\n\nAn alternative mitigation would be to run containerd in [rootless mode](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/rootless.md).\n\n### Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank David Leadbeater for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\n\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\n\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)",
