  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers running using the Argo Server with `--auth-mode=server` (which is the default \u003c v3.0.0) AND have exposed their UI to the Internet may allow remote users to execute arbitrary code on their cluster, e.g. crypto-mining.\n\n### Resolution\n\n* Do not expose your user interface to the Internet. \n* Change configuration. `--auth-mode=client`. \n\nFor users using an older 2.x version of Argo Server, consider upgrading to Argo Server version 3.x or later.\n",
