  "summary": " RCE via ZipSlip and symbolic links in argoproj/argo-workflows",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe patch deployed against CVE-2025-62156 is ineffective against malicious archives containing symbolic links.\n\n### Details\nThe untar code that handles symbolic links in archives is unsafe. Concretely, the computation of the link's target and the subsequent check are flawed: \nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5291e0b01f94ba864f96f795bb500f2cfc5ad799/workflow/executor/executor.go#L1034-L1037\n\n### PoC\n1. Create a malicious archive containing two files: a symbolik link with path \"./work/foo\" and target \"/etc\", and a normal text file with path \"./work/foo/hostname\".\n2. Deploy a workflow like the one in https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-p84v-gxvw-73pf with the malicious archive mounted at /work/tmp.\n3. Submit the workflow and wait for its execution. \n4. Connect to the corresponding pod and observe that the file \"/etc/hostname\" was altered by the untar operation performed on the malicious archive. The attacker can hence alter arbitrary files in this way. \n\n### Impact\nThe attacker can overwrite the file /var/run/argo/argoexec with a script of their choice, which will be executed at the pod's start.",
