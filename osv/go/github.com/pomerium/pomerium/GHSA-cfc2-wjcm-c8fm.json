  "summary": "Incorrect Authorization with specially crafted requests",
  "details": "Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities:\n\n- [CVE-2021-32777](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32779): incorrectly transform a URL containing a `#fragment` element, causing a mismatch in path-prefix based authorization decisions.\n- [CVE-2021-32779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32777): incorrectly handle duplicate headers, dropping all but the last.  This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions.\n\n### Impact\nWith specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.\n\n### Patches\n\nPomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy.  Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n\n### References\n[envoy GSA CVE-2021-32777](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-r222-74fw-jqr9)\n[envoy GSA CVE-2021-32779](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-6g4j-5vrw-2m8h)\n[envoy announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/5xBpsEZZDfE/m/wD05NZBbAgAJ)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pomerium/pomerium](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues)\n* Email us at [security@pomerium.com](mailto:security@pomerium.com)\n",
