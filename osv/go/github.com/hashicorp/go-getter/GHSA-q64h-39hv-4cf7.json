  "summary": "HashiCorp go-getter Vulnerable to Argument Injection When Fetching Remote Default Git Branches",
  "details": "When go-getter is performing a Git operation, go-getter will try to clone the given repository. If a Git reference is not passed along with the Git url, go-getter will then try to check the remote repositoryâ€™s HEAD reference of its default branch by passing arguments to the Git binary on the host it is executing on.\n\nAn attacker may format a Git URL in order to inject additional Git arguments to the Git call.\n\nConsumers of the go-getter library should evaluate the risk associated with these issues in the context of their go-getter usage and upgrade go-getter to 1.7.4 or later.
