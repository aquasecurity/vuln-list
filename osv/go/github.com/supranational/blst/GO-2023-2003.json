  "summary": "Group signature validation bypass in github.com/supranational/blst",
  "details": "When complemented with a check for infinity, blst skips performing a signature group-check. Formally speaking, infinity is the identity element of the elliptic curve group and as such it is a member of the group, so the group-check should be performed. The fix performs the check even in the presence of infinity.",
