  "summary": "Netmaker vulnerable to Insufficient Granularity of Access Control",
  "details": "### Impact\nImproper Authorization functions leads to non-privileged users running privileged API calls. If you have added users to your Netmaker platform who whould not have admin privileges, they could use their auth token to run admin-level functions via the API.\n\nIn addition, differing response codes based on function calls allowed non-users to potentially brute force the determination of names of networks on the system.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in v0.15.1. To apply:\n\n1. docker-compose down\n2. docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.15.1\n3. docker-compose up -d\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail us at [info@netmaker.io](mailto:info@netmaker.io)\nThis vulnerability was brought to our attention by @tweidinger",
