  "summary": "SiYuan vulnerable to RCE via zip slip and Command Injection via PandocBin",
  "details": "### Summary\nSiyuan is vulnerable to RCE. The issue stems from a \"Zip Slip\" vulnerability during zip file extraction, combined with the ability to overwrite system executables and subsequently trigger their execution.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Authenticate\n2. Create zip slip payload with path traversal entry `../../../../opt/siyuan/startup.sh`. startup.sh contains malicious code like:\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\necho 'you have been pwned' \u003e /siyuan/workspace/data/pwned.txt\necho \"pandoc 3.1.0\"\n```\n3. Upload zip to workspace via `/api/file/putFile`\n4. Extract zip via `/api/archive/unzip`, overwrites the existing executable `startup.sh` while maintaining the +x permission\n5. Trigger execution by calling `/api/setting/setExport` with `pandocBin=/opt/siyuan/startup.sh`. This calls `IsValidPandocBin()` which executes `startup.sh --version` that outputs \"pandoc 3.1.0\" and executes any arbitrary malicious code",
