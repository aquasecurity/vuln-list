  "summary": "OpenBao TOTP Secrets Engine Code Reuse",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nOpenBao's TOTP secrets engine could accept valid codes multiple times rather than strictly-once. This was caused by unexpected normalization in the underlying TOTP library.\n\n### Patches\n\nOpenBao v2.3.2 will patch this issue.\n\nIn patching, codes which were not normalized (strictly N numeric digits) will now be rejected. This is a potentially breaking change.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTOTP code verification is a privileged action; only trusted systems should be verifying codes. Ensure that all codes are first normalized before submitting to the OpenBao endpoint.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was disclosed to HashiCorp and is the OpenBao equivalent of the following tickets:\n\n- https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-17-vault-totp-secrets-engine-code-reuse/76036\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6014",
