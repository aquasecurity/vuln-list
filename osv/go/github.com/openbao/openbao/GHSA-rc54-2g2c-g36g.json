  "summary": "OpenBao and Vault Leak []byte Fields in Audit Logs ",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nOpenBao's audit log did not appropriately redact fields when relevant subsystems sent `[]byte` response parameters rather than `string`s. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- `sys/raw` with use of `encoding=base64`, all data would be emitted unredacted to the audit log.\n- Transit, when performing a signing operation with a derived Ed25519 key, would emit public keys to the audit log.\n\nThird-party plugins may be affected.\n\nThis issue has been present since HashiCorp Vault and continues to impact Vault as of v1.20.4. \n\n### Patches\n\nOpenBao v2.4.2 will patch this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf users do not use the above functionality, they are not impacted. To prohibit the use of `sys/raw` globally, ensure `raw_storage_endpoint=false` is set or missing from the server configuration.",
