  "summary": "OpenBao has a Timing Side-Channel in the Userpass Auth Method",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using OpenBao's `userpass` auth method, user enumeration was possible due to timing difference between non-existent users and users with stored credentials. This is independent of whether the supplied credentials were valid for the given user. \n\n### Patches\n\nOpenBao v2.3.2 will patch this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may use another auth method or apply rate limiting quotas to limit the number of requests in a period of time: https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was disclosed to HashiCorp and is the OpenBao equivalent of the following tickets:\n\n- https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-15-timing-side-channel-in-vault-s-userpass-auth-method/76034\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6011\n\nBarring further information, this is also assumed to cover and remediate the following additional vulnerability:\n\n- https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-21-vault-user-enumeration-in-userpass-auth-method/76095\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6010\n\nIf this is not the case as further details emerge, a new CVE will be assigned for remediating that. Otherwise, no further CVE will be sought.",
