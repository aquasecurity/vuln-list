  "summary": "Coder vulnerable to post-auth URL redirection to untrusted site ('Open Redirect')",
  "details": "### Summary\nAn issue on Coder's login page allows attackers to craft a Coder URL that when clicked by a logged in user could redirect them to a website the attacker controls, e.g. https://google.com.\n\n### Details\nOn the login page, Coder checks for the presence of a `redirect` query parameter. On successful login, the user would be redirected to the location of the parameter. Improper sanitization allows attackers to specify a URL outside of the Coder application to redirect users to.\n\n### Impact\nCoder users could potentially be redirected to a untrusted website if tricked into clicking a URL crafted by the attacker. Coder authentication tokens are **not** leaked to the resulting website.\n\nTo check if your deployment is vulnerable, visit the following URL for your Coder deployment:\n- `https://\u003ccoder url\u003e/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcoder.com%2Fdocs`\n\n### Patched Versions\nThis vulnerability is remedied in\n- v2.16.1\n- v2.15.3\n- v2.14.4\n\nAll versions prior to 2.3.1 are not affected.\n\n### Thanks\n- https://github.com/jchristov\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/coder/coder/security/advisories/GHSA-wcx9-ccpj-hx3c\nhttps://github.com/coder/coder/commit/69c1d981e3131e50d52b01f6a360abadaad699e6",
