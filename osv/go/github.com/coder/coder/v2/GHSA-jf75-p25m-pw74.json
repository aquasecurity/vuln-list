  "details": "## Summary\nWorkspace Agent manifests containing sensitive values were logged in plaintext unsanitized\n\n## Details\nBy default Workspace Agent logs are redirected to [stderr](https://linux.die.net/man/3/stderr)\nhttps://github.com/coder/coder/blob/a8862be546f347c59201e2219d917e28121c0edb/cli/agent.go#L432-L439\n\n[Workspace Agent Manifests](https://coder.com/docs/reference/agent-api/schemas#agentsdkmanifest) containing sensitive environment variables were logged insecurely\nhttps://github.com/coder/coder/blob/7beb95fd56d2f790502e236b64906f8eefb969bd/agent/agent.go#L1090\n\nAn attacker with limited local access to the Coder Workspace (VM, K8s Pod etc.) or a third-party system ([SIEM](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_information_and_event_management_tool), logging stack) could access those logs\n\nThis behavior opened room for unauthorized access and privilege escalation\n\n## Impact\nImpact varies depending on the environment variables set in a given workspace\n\n## Patches\n[Fix](https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/e2a46393fce40bc630df3293c1ee66a596277289) was released \u0026 backported:\n- https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.28.4\n- https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.27.7\n- https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.26.5\n\n## Workarounds\nOne potential workaround is to disable Workspace Agent Logs by setting following configuration option\n`CODER_AGENT_LOGGING_HUMAN=/dev/null` \n\u003e platform operators are advised to upgrade their deployments",
