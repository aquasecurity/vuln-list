  ],
  "summary": "Rancher's Failure to delete orphaned role bindings does not revoke project level access from group based authentication",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability only affects customers using group based authentication in Rancher versions up to and including 2.4.17, 2.5.11 and 2.6.2.\n\nWhen removing a Project Role associated to a group from a project, the bindings that grant access to cluster scoped resources for those subjects do not get deleted. This happens due to an incomplete authorization logic check. A user who is a member of an affected group with authenticated access to Rancher could use this to access resources they should no longer have access to. The exposure level will depend on the original permission level granted to the affected project role.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions include releases 2.4.18, 2.5.12, 2.6.3 and later versions.\n\n### Workarounds\nLimit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.\n\n### References\nCluster and project roles documentation for Rancher [2.6](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/), [2.5](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/) and [2.4](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.0-v2.4/en/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).",
