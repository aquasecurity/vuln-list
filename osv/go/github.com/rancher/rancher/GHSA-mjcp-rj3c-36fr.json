  "summary": "Rancher sends sensitive information to external services through the `/meta/proxy` endpoint",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA vulnerability has been identified within Rancher Manager whereby `Impersonate-Extra-*` headers are being sent to an external entity, for example `amazonaws.com`, via the `/meta/proxy` Rancher endpoint. These headers may contain identifiable and/or sensitive information e.g. email addresses.\n\nIf the authentication provider is configured to have email or other sensitive and/or identifiable information as part of the username and principal ID then when a new cloud credential is being created in Rancher Manager this information is sent to an external entity such as `amazonaws.com`, in case of an AWS cloud credentials, in `Impersonate-Extra-Username` and/or `Impersonate-Extra-Principalid` headers. Please note that neither password, password hashes or Rancherâ€™s related authentication tokens are leaked in those requests.\n\nThe entities to which such information is sent to are limited by the whitelisted domains specified in `nodedrivers.management.cattle.io` objects. \n\nFor example, the Amazon EC2 node driver contains the following whitelisted domains:\n\n- `iam.amazonaws.com`\n- `iam.us-gov.amazonaws.com`\n- `iam.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `iam.global.api.aws`\n- `ec2.%.amazonaws.com`\n- `ec2.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `ec2.%.api.aws`\n- `eks.%.amazonaws.com`\n- `eks.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `eks.%.api.aws`\n- `kms.%.amazonaws.com`\n- `kms.%.amazonaws.com.cn`\n- `kms.%.api.aws`\n\nWhile the DigitalOcean driver contains the following whitelisted domain:\n\n- `api.digitalocean.com`\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability is addressed by filtering all `Impersonate-*` headers from the original request by the `/meta/proxy` endpoint.\n\nPatched versions of Rancher include releases v2.12.2, v2.11.6, v2.10.10, and v2.9.12. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n### References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).",
