  "summary": "Steve doesn’t verify a server’s certificate and is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks",
  "details": "### Impact\nA vulnerability has been identified in Steve where by default it was using an insecure option that did not validate the certificate presented by the remote server while performing a TLS connection. This could allow the execution of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against services using Steve.\n\nFor example, Rancher relies on Steve as a dependency for its user interface (UI) to proxy requests to Kubernetes clusters. Users who have the permission to create a service in Rancher’s local cluster can take over Rancher’s UI and display their own UI to gather sensitive information. This is only possible when the setting `ui-offline-preferred` is manually set to `remote` (by default Rancher sets it to `dynamic`). This enables further attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), or tampering the UI to collect passwords from other users etc.\n\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE ATT\u0026CK - Technique - Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/) for further information about this category of attack.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions of Steve include releases `v0.2.1`, `v0.3.3`, `v0.4.4` and `v0.5.13`.\n\nThis vulnerability is addressed by changing Steve to always verify a server’s certificate based on Go’s TLS settings.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you can't upgrade to a fixed version, please make sure that you are only using Steve to connect to trusted servers.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).",
