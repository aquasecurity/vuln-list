  "summary": "GoUtils's randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected",
  "details": "Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The `RandomAlphaNumeric` and `CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric` functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.",
