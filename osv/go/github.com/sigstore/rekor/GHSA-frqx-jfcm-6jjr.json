  "summary": "malformed proposed intoto entries can cause a panic",
  "details": "### Impact\nA malformed proposed entry of the `intoto/v0.0.2` type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor process. The thread is recovered so the client receives a 500 error message and service still continues, so the availability impact of this is minimal.\n\n### Patches\nThis is fixed in v1.2.0 of Rekor.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo\n\n### References\nDiscovered by OSS-Fuzz",
