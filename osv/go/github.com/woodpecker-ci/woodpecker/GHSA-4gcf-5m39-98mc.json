  "summary": "Woodpecker does not validate webhook before changing any data",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker can post malformed webhook data which leads to an update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of a repository.\nThis is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage.\n\n### Patches\nPlease use either next or the latest v1.0 e.g. v1.0.2\n\n### Workarounds\nSecure the CI system by making it inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall.\n\n### References\nFix: https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2221\nBackport: https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2222",
