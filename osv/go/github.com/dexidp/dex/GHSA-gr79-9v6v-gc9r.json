  "details": "### Summary\n\nDex 2.37.0 is serving HTTPS with insecure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.\n\n\n### Details\nWhile working on https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/2848 and implementing configurable TLS support, I noticed my changes did not have any effect in TLS config, so I started investigating. \n\nhttps://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/70d7a2c7c1bb2646b1a540e49616cbc39622fb83/cmd/dex/serve.go#L425 is seemingly setting TLS 1.2 as minimum version, but the whole tlsConfig is ignored after \"TLS cert reloader\" was introduced in https://github.com/dexidp/dex/pull/2964. Configured cipher suites are not respected either, as seen on the output.\n\n### PoC\nBuild Dex, generate certs with `gencert.sh`, modify `config.dev.yaml` to run on https, using generated certs.\n\n```console\nissuer: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex\n\nstorage:\n  type: sqlite3\n  config:\n    file: dex.db\n\nweb:\n  https: 127.0.0.1:5556\n  tlsCert: examples/k8s/ssl/cert.pem\n  tlsKey: examples/k8s/ssl/key.pem\n\n\u003crest as default\u003e\n```\n\nRun dex `bin/dex serve config.dev.yaml`.\n\nInstall `sslyze`, easy to use SSL connection analyzer:\n\n```console\npip3 install sslyze\nsslyze 127.0.0.1:5556\n```\n\nIn Dex 2.37.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are enabled in addition to expected TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.\n```console\n * TLS 1.0 Cipher Suites:\n     Attempted to connect using 80 cipher suites.\n\n     The server accepted the following 6 cipher suites:\n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA                      256                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA                      128                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA                     168                      \n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA                256       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA                128       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA               168       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n\n     The group of cipher suites supported by the server has the following properties:\n       Forward Secrecy                    OK - Supported\n       Legacy RC4 Algorithm               OK - Not Supported\n\n\n * TLS 1.1 Cipher Suites:\n     Attempted to connect using 80 cipher suites.\n\n     The server accepted the following 6 cipher suites:\n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA                      256                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA                      128                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA                     168                      \n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA                256       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA                128       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA               168       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n\n     The group of cipher suites supported by the server has the following properties:\n       Forward Secrecy                    OK - Supported\n       Legacy RC4 Algorithm               OK - Not Supported\n\n\n * TLS 1.2 Cipher Suites:\n     Attempted to connect using 156 cipher suites.\n\n     The server accepted the following 11 cipher suites:\n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384                   256                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA                      256                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256                   128                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA                      128                      \n        TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA                     168                      \n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256       256       ECDH: X25519 (253 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384             256       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA                256       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256             128       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA                128       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n        TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA               168       ECDH: prime256v1 (256 bits)\n\n     The group of cipher suites supported by the server has the following properties:\n       Forward Secrecy                    OK - Supported\n       Legacy RC4 Algorithm               OK - Not Supported\n\n\n * TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites:\n     Attempted to connect using 5 cipher suites.\n\n     The server accepted the following 3 cipher suites:\n        TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256                      256       ECDH: X25519 (253 bits)\n        TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384                            256       ECDH: X25519 (253 bits)\n        TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256                            128       ECDH: X25519 (253 bits)\n```\n\nIn Dex 2.36.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are disabled as expected.\n```console\n * TLS 1.0 Cipher Suites:\n     Attempted to connect using 80 cipher suites;
