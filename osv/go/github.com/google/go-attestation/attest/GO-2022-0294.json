  "details": "A local attacker can defeat remotely-attested measured boot.\n\nImproper input validation in AKPublic.Verify can cause it to succeed when\nprovided with a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs. Subsequent use\nof the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication\nperformed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker can couple this\nvulnerability with a maliciously-formed TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof\nevents in the TCG log, defeating remotely-attested measured-boot.\n",
