  "summary": "Improper input validation in github.com/google/go-attestation",
  "details": "A local attacker can defeat remotely-attested measured boot.\n\nImproper input validation in AKPublic.Verify can cause it to succeed when provided with a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs. Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker can couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-formed TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG log, defeating remotely-attested measured-boot.",
