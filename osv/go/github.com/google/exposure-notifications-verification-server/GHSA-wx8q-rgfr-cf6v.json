  ],
  "summary": "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control in github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server",
  "details": "### Impact\nUsers or API keys with permission to expire verification codes could have expired codes that belonged to another realm if they guessed the UUID.\n\n### Patches\nv1.1.2+\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds, and there are no indications this has been exploited in the wild. Verification codes can only be expired by providing their 64-bit UUID, and verification codes are already valid for a very short period of time (thus the UUID rotates frequently).\n\n### For more information\nContact exposure-notifications-feedback@google.com",
