  "summary": "Privilege escalation in rbac",
  "details": "### Impact\nUsing a carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, a user with `UserWrite` permissions could create another user with higher privileges than their own due to insufficient checks on the allowed set of permissions. The event would be captured in the Event Log.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in 0.24.0 and 0.23.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are unable to upgrade, we recommend auditing users who have `UserWrite` permissions and regularly reviewing the Event Log for malicious activity.\n\n### Kudos\nThank you to Michael Mazzolini (Ethical Hacker at WHO) for finding and disclosing this vulnerability.",
