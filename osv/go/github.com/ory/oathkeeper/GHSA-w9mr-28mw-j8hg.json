  "summary": "Hop-by-hop abuse to malform header mutator",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nDownstream services relying on the presence of headers set by the `header` mutator could be exploited. A client can drop the header set by the `header` mutator by including that header's name in the `Connection` header. Example minimal config:\n\n```yaml\n- id: 'example'\n  upstream:\n    url: 'https://example.com'\n  match:\n    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4455/'\n    methods:\n      - GET\n  authenticators:\n    - handler: anonymous\n  authorizer:\n    handler: allow\n  mutators:\n    - handler: header\n      config:\n        headers:\n          X-Subject: {{ .Subject }}\n```\n\n```\ncurl -H \"Connection: close,x-subject\" http://127.0.0.1:4455/\n```\n\nThe `X-Subject` header will not arrive at the downstream server. It is completely dropped. In case the downstream server handles such a request in an unexpected way, an attacker can exploit this, assuming they know or guess the internal header name.\n\n### Patches\n\nc5cc7f736dc84185034be4356057d1c7a656d797\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe downstream server should handle the case that an expected header is not set by responding with an appropriate error.\n\n### References\n\nSee background info in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50580",
