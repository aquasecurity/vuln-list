  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-5gjg-jgh4-gppm. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nWeb Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods which may be set, leading to a nil pointer dereference if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass. This issue only affects WebSockets with an AuthenticateMethod hook. Request handlers that do not explicitly use WebSockets are not vulnerable.",
