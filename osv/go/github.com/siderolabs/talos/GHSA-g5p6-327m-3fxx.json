  "summary": "Talos Linux ships runc vulnerable to the escape to the host attack",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nSnyk has discovered a vulnerability in all versions of runc \u003c=1.1.11, as used by the Docker engine, along with other containerization technologies such as Kubernetes. Exploitation of this issue can result in container escape to the underlying host OS, either through executing a malicious image or building an image using a malicious Dockerfile or upstream image (i.e., when using FROM). This issue has been assigned the CVE-2024-21626.\n\n### Patches\n\n`runc` runtime was updated to 1.1.12 in Talos v1.5.6 and v1.6.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInspect the workloads running on the cluster to make sure they are not trying to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv)\n* [Vulnerability: runc process.cwd and leaked fds container breakout](https://snyk.io/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/)\n",
