  "summary": "Karmada Tar Slips in CRDs archive extraction",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nBoth in karmadactl and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a karmada initialization could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFrom karmada version v1.12.0, when processing custom CRDs files, CRDs archive verification is utilized to enhance file system robustness.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nWhen using `karmadactl init` to set up Karmada, if you need to set flag `--crd` to customize the CRD files required for karmada initialization, you can manually inspect the CRD files to check whether they contain sequences such as `../` that would alter file paths, to determine if they potentially include malicious files. \n\nWhen using karmada-operator to set up Karmada, you must upgrade your karmada-operator to one of the fixed versions.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n1. Enhancements made from the Karmada community: https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5713, https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5703\n",
