  "summary": "Karmada PULL Mode Cluster Privilege Escalation",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThe [PULL](https://karmada.io/docs/next/userguide/clustermanager/cluster-registration#pull-mode) mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters.\n\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nSince Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nRestricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to [Karmada Component Permissions Docs](https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/security/component-permission).\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n 1. Enhancements made from the Karmada community: https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5793\n 2.
