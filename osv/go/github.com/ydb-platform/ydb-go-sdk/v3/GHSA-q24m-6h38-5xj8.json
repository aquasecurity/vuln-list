  "summary": "ydb-go-sdk token in custom credentials object can leak through logs",
  "details": "### Impact\nSince [ydb-go-sdk/v3.48.6](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/v3.48.6/internal/balancer/balancer.go#L71) if you use a custom credentials object (implementation of interface [Credentials](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/master/credentials/credentials.go#L10)) it may leak into logs. This happens because this object could be serialized into an error message using `fmt.Errorf(\"something went wrong (credentials: %q)\", credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. Printf func use placeholder `%q` for string representation of argument with quotes. If an argument implements interface `fmt.Stringer`, it will used through `String()` func. In other cases used fallback - serialization with reflection.\n\nIf such logging occurred, a  malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database.\n\nWho is impacted: applications with custom credentials object with an explicit token field.\n\nA leak could have occurred if all of these conditions were met simultaneously:\n1) The credentials object does not implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface (does not have a `String()` method) - potentially these are custom credentials. Official credentials have a `String()` method.\n2) There was an error connecting to YDB during driver creation via `ydb.Open(...)`.\n3) Some logging system was configured (`ydb-go-sdk` does not log such errors by default).\n4) The connection error was logged into a system that a malicious user had access to.\n\n### Patches\n`ydb-go-sdk` contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem has been released in version v3.53.3 ([PR](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/pull/859)).\n\n### Workarounds\nImplement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit stringify of object state.",
