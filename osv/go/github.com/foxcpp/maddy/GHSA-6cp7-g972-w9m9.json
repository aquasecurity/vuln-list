  "summary": "Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date and Insufficient Session Expiration in Maddy Mail Server",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAny configuration on any maddy version \u003c0.5.4 using auth.pam is affected.\n\nNo password expiry or account expiry checking is done when authenticating using PAM.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch is available as part of the 0.5.4 release.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf /etc/shadow authentication is used, it is possible to replace auth.pam with auth.shadow which is not affected.\n\nIt is possible to blacklist expired accounts via existing filtering mechanisms (e.g. auth_map to invalid accounts in storage.imapsql).\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/blob/3412e59a2c92106e194fa69f2f1017c020037c9c/internal/auth/pam/pam.c\n* https://linux.die.net/man/3/pam_acct_mgmt\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy\n* Email fox.cpp@disroot.org\n",
