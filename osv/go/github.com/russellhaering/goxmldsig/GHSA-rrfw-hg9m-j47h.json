  "summary": "Signature Validation Bypass",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn authentication bypass exists in the [goxmldsig](https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/security/advisories/GHSA-q547-gmf8-8jr7) this library uses to determine if SAML assertions are genuine. An attacker could craft a SAML response that would appear to be valid but would not have been genuinely issued by the IDP.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 0.4.2 bumps the dependency which should fix the issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nPlease see [the advisory in goxmldsig](https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/security/advisories/GHSA-q547-gmf8-8jr7)\n\n## Credits\n\nThe original vulnerability was discovered by @jupenur. Thanks to @russellhaering for the heads up.",
