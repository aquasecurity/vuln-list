  "summary": "Zitadel allows brute-forcing authentication factors",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA vulnerability in Zitadel allowed brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP and password allowing to impersonate the attacked user.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can perform an online brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP, and passwords. While Zitadel allows preventing online brute force attacks in scenarios like TOTP, Email OTP, or passwords using a lockout mechanism. The mechanism is not enabled by default and can cause a denial of service for the corresponding user if enabled. Additionally, the mitigation strategies were not fully implemented in the more recent resource-based APIs.\n\n### Affected Versions\n\nAll versions within the following ranges, including release candidates (RCs), are affected:\n- **4.x**: `4.0.0` to `4.4.0` (including RC versions)\n- **3.x**: `3.0.0` to `3.4.2` (including RC versions)\n- **2.x**: `v2.0.0` to `2.71.17`\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in the latest releases. The patch resolves the issue by enforcing the lockout policy on all OTP, TOTP and password checks. Additionally a “tar pit” has been introduced to slow down brute-force attacks by default. Zitadel responses will be delayed by t seconds, where t increases over the number of failed attempts within a given timeframe.\n\n4.x: Upgrade to \u003e=[4.6.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.6.0)\n3.x: Update to \u003e=[3.4.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.3)\n2.x: Update to \u003e=[2.71.18](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.71.18)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe recommended solution is to update Zitadel to a patched version.\n\nThe problem might be mitigated by enabling the optional logout policy (\"Password maximum attempts\") or by implementing more strict rate limits.\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was found by [zentrust partners GmbH](https://zentrust.partners) during a scheduled penetration test. Thank you to the analysts Martin Tschirsich, Joud Zakharia, Christopher Baumann.\nThe full report will be made public after the complete review.",
