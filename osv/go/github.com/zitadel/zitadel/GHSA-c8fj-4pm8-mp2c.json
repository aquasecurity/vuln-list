  "summary": "Broken Authorization in ZITADEL Actions",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n**Actions**, introduced in ZITADEL **1.42.0** on the API and **1.56.0** for Console, is a feature, where users with role `ORG_OWNER` are able to create Javascript Code, which is invoked by the system at certain points during the login.\n**Actions**, for example, allow creating authorizations (user grants) on newly created users programmatically.\nDue to a missing authorization check, **Actions** were able to grant authorizations for projects that belong to other organisations inside the same Instance. Granting authorizations via API and Console is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.x versions are fixed on \u003e= [2.2.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.2.0)\n1.x versions are fixed on \u003e= [1.87.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v1.87.1)\n\nZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround since a patch is already available.\n\n### Who did disclose this\n\nDuring our recurring white box penetration test our external security consultant found this issue.\nThe full report will be made public after the complete review.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://docs.zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/customize/behavior\nhttps://docs.zitadel.com/docs/apis/actions\nhttps://zitadel.com/blog/pentest-results-h1-2021\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n",
