  "summary": "Zitadel Discloses the Total Number of Instance Users",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nZitadel's User Service discloses the total number of instance users to unauthorized users.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe ZITADEL User Service exposes the total number of users within an instance to any authenticated user, regardless of their specific permissions. While this does not leak individual user data or PII, disclosing the total user count via the `totalResult` field constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability that may be sensitive in certain contexts.\n\n### Affected Versions\n\nSystems running one of the following version are affected:\n\n- **4.x**: `4.0.0-rc.1` through `4.7.1`\n- **3.x**: `3.0.0-rc.1` through `3.4.4`\n- **2.x**: `2.44.0` through `2.71.19`\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in the latest release. The patch resolves the issue and returns the `totalResult` value corresponding to the number of instance users for whom the querying user has read permission.\n\n- 4.x: Upgrade to \u003e=[4.7.2](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.7.2)\n- 3.x: Update to \u003e=[3.4.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.5)\n- 2.x: Update to \u003e=[3.4.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.5) (or checkout the workarounds section)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe recommended solution is to update Zitadel to a patched version.\n\nIf a version upgrade is not possible, you can enable the `permissionCheckV2` feature on your instance.\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was found by [zentrust partners GmbH](https://zentrust.partners) during a scheduled penetration test. Thank you to the analysts Martin Tschirsich, Joud Zakharia, Christopher Baumann.\nThe full report will be made public after the complete review.",
