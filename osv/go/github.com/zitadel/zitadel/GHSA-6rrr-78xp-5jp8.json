  "summary": "Zitadel RefreshToken invalidation vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nRefreshTokens is an OAuth 2.0 feature that allows applications to retrieve new access tokens and refresh the user's session without the need for interacting with a UI.\n\nRefreshTokens were not invalidated when a user was locked or deactivated. The deactivated or locked user was able to obtain a valid access token only through a refresh token grant.\n\nWhen the locked or deactivated user’s session was already terminated (“logged out”) then it was not possible to create a new session. Renewal of access token through a refresh token grant is limited to the configured amount of time (RefreshTokenExpiration).\n\n### Patches\n2.x versions are fixed on \u003e= [2.17.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.17.3)\n2.16.x versions are fixed on \u003e= [2.16.4](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.16.4)\n\nZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure the RefreshTokenExpiration in the OIDC settings of your instance is set according to your security requirements.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/instance-settings#oidc-token-lifetimes-and-expiration\n",
