  "summary": "Gin Web Framework does not properly sanitize filename parameter of Context.FileAttachment function",
  "details": "The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of \"setup.bat\u0026quot;;x=.txt\" will be sent as a file named \"setup.bat\".\n\nIf the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.",
