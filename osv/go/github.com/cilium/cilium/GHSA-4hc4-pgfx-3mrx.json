  ],
  "summary": "cilium-agent container can access the host via `hostPath` mount",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker with access to a Cilium agent pod can write to `/opt/cni/bin` due to a `hostPath` mount of that directory in the agent pod. By replacing the CNI binary with their own malicious binary and waiting for the creation of a new pod on the node, the attacker can gain access to the underlying node. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed and is available on versions \u003e=1.11.15, \u003e=1.12.8, \u003e=1.13.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n[Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) should be used to deny users and service accounts `exec` access to Cilium agent pods.\n\nIn cases where a user requires `exec` access to Cilium agent pods, but should not have access to the underlying node, no workaround is possible.\n\n### References\n\n* [PR containing resolution](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/24075)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent and Form3 to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Anastasios Koutlis, Daniel Teixeira, and Magdalena Oczadly for their cooperation. \n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nAs usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority. ",
