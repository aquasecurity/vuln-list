  "summary": "Potential network policy bypass when routing IPv6 traffic ",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nUnder specific conditions, Cilium may misattribute the source IP address of traffic to a cluster, identifying external traffic as coming from the host on which Cilium is running. As a consequence, network policies for that cluster might be bypassed, depending on the specific network policies enabled. Only IPv6 traffic is impacted by this vulnerability.\n\nThis issue only manifests when:\n* Cilium is routing IPv6 traffic, and\n* Kube-proxy is used for service handling, and\n* NodePorts are used to route traffic to pods.\n\nIPv6 is disabled by default. Cilium's kube-proxy replacement feature is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed and is available on versions \u003e=1.11.15, \u003e=1.12.8, \u003e=1.13.1\n\n## Workarounds\n\nDisable IPv6 routing (IPv6 is disabled by default).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Yusuke Suzuki for both highlighting and fixing the issue.\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nAs usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: security@cilium.io - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.",
