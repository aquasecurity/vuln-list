  "summary": "Potential HTTP policy bypass when using header rules in Cilium",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis issue only impacts users who:\n\n- Have a HTTP policy that applies to multiple `toEndpoints` AND\n- Have an allow-all rule in place that affects only one of those endpoints\n\nIn such cases, a wildcard rule will be appended to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass of HTTP policies.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in Cilium 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRewrite HTTP rules for each endpoint separately. For example, if the initial rule looks like:\n\n```\n  egress:\n    - toEndpoints:\n        - matchLabels:\n            k8s:kind: echo\n        - matchLabels:\n            k8s:kind: example\n      toPorts:\n        - ports:\n            - port: \"8080\"\n              protocol: TCP\n          rules:\n            http:\n              - method: \"GET\"\n```\n\nIt should be rewritten to:\n \n```\n  egress:\n    - toEndpoints:\n        - matchLabels:\n            k8s:kind: echo\n      toPorts:\n        - ports:\n            - port: \"8080\"\n              protocol: TCP\n          rules:\n            http:\n              - method: \"GET\"\n    - toEndpoints:\n        - matchLabels:\n            k8s:kind: example\n      toPorts:\n        - ports:\n            - port: \"8080\"\n              protocol: TCP\n          rules:\n            http:\n              - method: \"GET\"\n```     \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @jrajahalme for investigating and fixing the issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nAs usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io) - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top priority.\n",
