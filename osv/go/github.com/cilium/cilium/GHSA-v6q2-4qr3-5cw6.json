  "summary": "Unencrypted traffic between nodes when using WireGuard and L7 policies",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIn Cilium clusters with WireGuard enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies:\n\n- Traffic that should be WireGuard-encrypted is sent unencrypted between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes.\n- Traffic that should be WireGuard-encrypted is sent unencrypted between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n* In native routing mode (`routingMode=native`):\n  * Cilium v1.14 versions before v1.14.8\n  * Cilium v1.15 versions before v1.15.2\n* In tunneling mode (`routingMode=tunnel`):\n  * Cilium v1.14 versions before v1.14.4\n  * Cilium v1.14.4 if `encryption.wireguard.encapsulate` is set to `false` (default).\n\nThis issue has been resolved in:\n\n* In native routing mode (`routingMode=native`):\n  * Cilium v1.14.8\n  * Cilium v1.15.2\n* In tunneling mode (`routingMode=tunnel`):\n  * Cilium v1.14.4. **NOTE** `encryption.wireguard.encapsulate` must be set to `true`.\n   \n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @brb, @giorio94, @gandro and @jschwinger233 for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nIf you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.\n",
