  "summary": "Cilium leaks sensitive information in cilium-bugtool",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe output of `cilium-bugtool` can contain sensitive data when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled.\n\nUsers of the following features are affected:\n\n- [TLS inspection](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/tls-visibility/#gs-tls-inspection)\n- [Ingress with TLS termination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/tls-termination/#gs-ingress-tls)\n- [Gateway API with TLS termination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/gateway-api/https/)\n- [Kafka network policies with API key filtering](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#kafka-beta)\n\nThe sensitive data includes:\n\n- The CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API\n- The API keys used in Kafka-related network policy\n\n`cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n- Cilium v1.13 between v1.13.0 and v1.13.16 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.14 between v1.14.0 and v1.14.11 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.5 inclusive\n\nThis issue has been patched in:\n\n- Cilium v1.15.6\n- Cilium v1.14.12\n- Cilium v1.13.17\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @sayboras for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.",
