  "details": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-mh55-gqvf-xfwm. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nMiddleware causes a prohibitive amount of heap allocations when processing malicious preflight requests that include a Access-Control-Request-Headers (ACRH) header whose value contains many commas. This behavior can be abused by attackers to produce undue load on the middleware/server as an attempt to cause a denial of service.",
