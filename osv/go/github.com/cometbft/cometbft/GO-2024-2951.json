  "summary": "Denial of service when syncing with a malicious peer in github.com/cometbft/cometbft",
  "details": "A malicious peer can cause a syncing node to panic during blocksync. The syncing node may enter into a catastrophic invalid syncing state or get stuck in blocksync mode, never switching to consensus. Nodes that are vulnerable to this state may experience a Denial of Service condition in which syncing will not work as expected when joining a network as a client.",
