  "summary": "CometBFT is unstability during blocksync when syncing from malicious peer",
  "details": "**Name**: ASA-2024-008: Instability during blocksync when syncing from malicious peer\n**Component**: CometBFT\n**Criticality**: Medium ([ACMv1](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md): I:Moderate; L: Possible)\n**Affected versions**: \u003c v0.38.7 \n\n# Summary\n\nAn issue was identified for nodes syncing on an existing network during blocksync in which a malicious peer could cause the syncing peer to panic, enter into a catastrophic invalid syncing state or get stuck in blocksync mode, never switching to consensus. It is recommended for all clients to adopt this patch so that blocksync functions as expected and is tolerant of malicious peers presenting invalid data in this situation. Nodes that are vulnerable to this state may experience a Denial of Service condition in which syncing will not work as expected when joining a network as a client.\n\n# Recognition\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 5/01/24 by unknown_feature.
