  "summary": "CometBFT has inconsistencies between how commit signatures are verified and how block time is derived",
  "details": "# CSA-2026-001: Tachyon\n\n## Description\n\n**Name:** CSA-2026-001: Tachyon\n\n**Criticality:** Critical (Catastrophic Impact; Possible Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\n\n**Affected versions:** All versions of CometBFT\n\n**Affected users:** Validators and protocols relying on block timestamps\n\n## Description\n\nA consensus-level vulnerability was discovered in CometBFT's \"BFT Time\" implementation due to an inconsistency between how commit signatures are verified and how block time is derived.\n\nThis breaks a core BFT Time guarantee: \"A faulty process cannot arbitrarily increase the Time value.\"\n\n## Impact\n\nDownstream impact on chains affects any module, smart contract, or system that relies on the block timestamp.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v0.38.21](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.21) and [v0.37.18](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.18) fix this issue. The `main` unreleased branch is also patched.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds for this vulnerability. Upgrading to patched versions is required.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- January 8, 2026, 5:27PM UTC: Issue reported to Cosmos Bug Bounty Program\n- January 9, 2026, 4:55AM UTC: Issue triaged and validated by core team\n- January 12, 2026, 10:25PM UTC: Core team completes patch for the issue\n- January 13, 2026 4:41PM UTC: Pre-notification delivered to ecosystem partners\n- January 23, 2026, 3:00PM UTC: Patch made available\n\n## Credits\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.
