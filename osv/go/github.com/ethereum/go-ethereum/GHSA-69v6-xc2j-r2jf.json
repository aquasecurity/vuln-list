  "summary": "Shallow copy bug in geth",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis is a Consensus vulnerability, which can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. \n\nGethâ€™s pre-compiled `dataCopy` (at `0x00...04`) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that \n\n- writes `X` to an EVM memory region `R`,\n- calls `0x00..04` with `R` as an argument,\n- overwrites `R` to `Y`,\n- and finally invokes the `RETURNDATACOPY` opcode.\n\nWhen this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push `X` on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push `Y`.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nNo standalone patches have been made. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrade to `1.9.17` or higher.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/12/geth_security_release/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)\n* Email us at [security@ethereum.org](mailto:security@ethereum.org)\n",
