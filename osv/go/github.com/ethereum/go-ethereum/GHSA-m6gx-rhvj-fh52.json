  "summary": "Denial of service in go-ethereum due to CVE-2020-28362",
  "details": "### Impact\nVersions of Geth built with Go `\u003c1.15.5` or `\u003c1.14.12` are most likely affected by a critical DoS-related security vulnerability. The golang team has registered the underlying flaw as ‘CVE-2020-28362’.\n\nWe recommend all users to rebuild (ideally `v1.9.24`) with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12`, to avoid node crashes. Alternatively, if you are running binaries distributed via one of our official channels, we’re going to release `v1.9.24` ourselves built with Go `1.15.5`.\n\n### Patches\nThis is not an issue in go-ethereum, rebuilding an older version with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12` will suffice to address the vulnerability. \n\n### Workarounds\nRebuilding with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12` will suffice to address the vulnerability. \n\n### References\n- https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/12/geth_security_release/\n- https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/NpBGTTmKzpM\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)\n* Email us at [security@ethereum.org](mailto:security@ethereum.org)\n",
