  "summary": "Fleet has a JWT signature bypass vulnerability in Azure AD MDM enrollment ",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIf Windows MDM is enabled, an attacker can enroll rogue devices by submitting a forged JWT containing arbitrary identity claims. Due to missing JWT signature verification, Fleet accepts these claims without validating that the token was issued by Azure AD, allowing enrollment under any Azure AD user identity.\n\n### Patches\n\n- 4.78.3\n- 4.77.1\n- 4.76.2\n- 4.75.2\n- 4.53.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade is not possible, affected Fleet users should temporarily disable Windows MDM.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail us at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)\nJoin #fleet in [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)",
