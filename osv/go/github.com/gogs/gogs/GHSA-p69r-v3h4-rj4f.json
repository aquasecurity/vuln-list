  "details": "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-vm62-9jw3-c8w3. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nThe built-in SSH server of Gogs through 0.13.0 allows argument injection in internal/ssh/ssh.go, leading to remote code execution. Authenticated attackers can exploit this by opening an SSH connection and sending a malicious --split-string env request if the built-in SSH server is activated. Windows installations are unaffected.",
