  "summary": "IPFS go-bitfield vulnerable to DoS via malformed size arguments",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s.\n\nThis happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative.\nThere were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation:\n\u003e ```\n\u003e Panics if size is not a multiple of 8.\n\u003e ````\n\nBut it incomplete and missing from `FromBytes`'s documentation.\n\nThis has been replaced by returning an `(Bitfield, error)` and returning a non nil error if the size is wrong.\n\n### Patches\n- https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/commit/5e1d256fe043fc4163343ccca83862c69c52e579\n\n### Workarounds\n- Ensure `size%8 == 0 \u0026\u0026 size \u003e= 0` yourself before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q264-w97q-q778\n",
