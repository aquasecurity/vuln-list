  "summary": "cheqd-node Security patch for upstream vulnerabilities in IBC-Go (ISA-2025-001) and Cosmos SDK (ISA-2025-002)",
  "details": "# Description\n\nThere have been two upstream security advisories and associated patches published under [ISA-2025-001](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v) and [ISA-2025-002](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg).\n\n**[ISA-2025-001](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v)** affects the IBC-Go package., where non-deterministic JSON unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgements can result in a chain halt. \n\n**[ISA-2025-002](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg)** affects the Cosmos SDK package, where `x/group` can halt when erroring in `EndBlocker`.\n\n### Impact\nIf unaddressed, this could result in a chain halt.\n\n### Patches\nValidators, full nodes, and IBC relayers should upgrade to [cheqd-node v3.1.8](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v3.1.8). This upgrade does not require a software upgrade proposal on-chain and is meant to be non state-breaking.",
