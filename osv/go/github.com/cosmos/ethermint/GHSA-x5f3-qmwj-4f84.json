  "details": "Cosmos Network Ethermint \u003c= v0.4.0 is affected by a cross-chain transaction replay vulnerability in the EVM module. Since ethermint uses the same chainIDEpoch and signature schemes with ethereum for compatibility, a verified signature in ethereum is still valid in ethermint with the same msg content and chainIDEpoch, which enables \"cross-chain transaction replay\" attack.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngithub.com/cosmos/ethermint/rpc/namespaces/eth",
