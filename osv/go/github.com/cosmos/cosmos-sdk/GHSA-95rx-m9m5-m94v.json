  "details": "## ASA-2024-006: ValidateVoteExtensions helper function may allow incorrect voting power assumptions\n\n**Component**: Cosmos SDK\n**Criticality**: High\n**Affected Versions**: Cosmos SDK versions \u003c= 0.50.4, on 0.50 branches\n**Affected Users**: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators\n**Impact**: Elevation of Privilege\n\n## Summary\n\nThe default `ValidateVoteExtensions` helper function infers total voting power based off of the injected `VoteExtension`, which are injected by the proposer.  If your chain utilizes the `ValidateVoteExtensions` helper in `ProcessProposal`, a dishonest proposer can potentially mutate voting power of each validator it includes in the injected `VoteExtension`, which could have potentially unexpected or negative consequences on modified state.  Additional validation on injected `VoteExtension` data was added to confirm voting power against the state machine.\n\n## Next Steps for Impacted Parties\n\nIf you are a chain developer on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update to the latest available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project.  Once a patched version is available, it is recommended that network operators upgrade.\n\nA Github Security Advisory for this issue is available in the Cosmos-SDK [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-95rx-m9m5-m94v).
