  "summary": "Contrast leaks workload secrets to logs on INFO level",
  "details": "This is the same vulnerability as https://github.com/edgelesssys/contrast/security/advisories/GHSA-h5f8-crrq-4pw8. The original vulnerability had been fixed for release `v1.8.1`, but the fix was not ported to the main branch and thus not present in releases `v1.9.0` ff.\n\nBelow is a brief repetition of the relevant sections from the first GHSA, where you can find the full details.\n\n### Impact\n\n* [Workload secrets](https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.11/architecture/secrets#workload-secrets) are visible to Kubernetes users with `get` or `list` permission on `pods/logs`, and thus need to be considered compromised.\n* Since workload secrets are used for [encrypted storage](https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.11/howto/encrypted-storage) and [Vault integration](https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.11/howto/vault), those need to be considered compromised, too.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatches:\n\n* https://github.com/edgelesssys/contrast/commit/5a5512c4af63c17bb66331e7bd2768a863b2f225\n* https://github.com/edgelesssys/contrast/commit/cf58026b30c43fe7df91eac5322da02e1725d554\n\nThe patches are released with `v1.12.2` and `v1.13.0` (not yet published). Since the secrets are compromised, Contrast needs to be initialized from scratch.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nExisting workload secrets are compromised. The Contrast cluster needs to be newly initialized, and logging needs to be turned off. \n\n### References\n\nFirst occurrence:\n* https://github.com/edgelesssys/contrast/security/advisories/GHSA-h5f8-crrq-4pw8\n\nWe are defining a process for handling GHSAs that should prevent such regressions in the future:\n* https://github.com/edgelesssys/contrast/pull/1739",
