  "summary": "MarbleRun unauthenticated recovery allows Coordinator impersonation",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nDuring recovery, a Coordinator only verifies that a given recovery key decrypts the sealed state, not if this key was provided by a party with access to one of the recovery keys defined in the manifest.\nThis allows an attacker to manually craft a sealed state using their own recovery keys, and a manifest that does not match the rest of the state.\n\nIf network traffic is redirected from the legitimate coordinator to the attacker's Coordinator, a remote party is susceptible to impersonation if they verify the Coordinator without comparing the root certificate of the Coordinator against a trusted reference.\n\nUnder these circumstances, an attacker can trick a remote party into trusting the malicious Coordinator by presenting a manifest that does not match the actual state of the deployment.\n\nThis issue does **not** affect the following:\n\n* secrets and state of the legitimate Coordinator instances\n* integrity of workloads\n* certificates chaining back to the legitimate Coordinator root certificate\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in [`v1.7.0`](https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/tag/v1.7.0).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nConnections that purely authenticate based on a known Coordinator's root certificate, e.g. the one retrieved when using the `marblerun manifest set` CLI command, are not affected.",
