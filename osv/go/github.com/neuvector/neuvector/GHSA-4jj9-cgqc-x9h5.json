  ],
  "summary": "NeuVector OpenID Connect is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nNeuVector supports login authentication through OpenID Connect. However, the TLS verification (which verifies the remote server's authenticity and integrity) for OpenID Connect is not enforced by default. As a result this may expose the system to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\nStarting from version 5.4.0, NeuVector supports TLS verification for following connection types:\n\n- Registry Connections\n- Auth Server Connections (SAML, LDAP and OIDC)\n- Webhook Connections\n\nBy default, TLS verification remains disabled, and its configuration is located under **Settings \u003e Configuration in the NeuVector UI**.\n\nIn the patched version, the new NeuVector deployment enables TLS verification by default. \nFor rolling upgrades, NeuVector does not automatically change this setting to prevent disruptions.\n\n**Note:** When \"TLS verification\" is enabled, it affects all connections to:\n\n- Registry servers\n- Auth servers (SAML, LDAP and OIDC)\n- Webhook servers\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include release v5.4.8 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo manually enable TLS verification:\n\n1. Open the NeuVector UI.\n2. Navigate to **Settings \u003e Configuration**.\n3. In the **TLS Self-Signed Certificate Configuration** section, select **Enable TLS verification**.\n4. (Optional) Upload or paste the **TLS self-signed certificate**.\n\n### References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [NeuVector](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-neuvector/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/neuvector-v-all-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#suse-security).",
