  "summary": "1Panel's password verification is suspected to have a timing attack vulnerability",
  "details": "### Summary\n源码中密码校验处使用 != 符号，而不是`hmac.Equal`，这可能导致产生计时攻击漏洞，从而爆破密码。  \n建议使用 `hmac.Equal` 比对密码。\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe source code uses the != symbol instead of hmac.Equal for password verification, which may lead to timing attack vulnerabilities that can lead to password cracking. It is recommended to use hmac. Equal to compare passwords.\n\n### Details\nhttps://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/blob/dev/backend/app/service/auth.go#L81C5-L81C26\n\n### Impact\n该产品的所有使用者。\n\nTranslation:\n\nAll users of this product.",
