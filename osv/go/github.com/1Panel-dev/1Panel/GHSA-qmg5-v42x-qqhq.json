  "summary": "1Panel – CAPTCHA Bypass via Client-Controlled Flag ",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability in the 1Panel authentication API allows an unauthenticated attacker to disable CAPTCHA verification by abusing a client-controlled parameter. Because the server previously trusted this value without proper validation, CAPTCHA protections could be bypassed, enabling automated login attempts and significantly increasing the risk of account takeover (ATO).\n\n### Details\n\nThe /api/login endpoint accepts a boolean field named ignoreCaptcha directly from the client request body:\n\n`\"ignoreCaptcha\": true`\n\n\nThe backend implementation uses this value to determine whether CAPTCHA validation should be performed:\n\n```\nif !req.IgnoreCaptcha {\n    if errMsg := captcha.VerifyCode(req.CaptchaID, req.Captcha); errMsg != \"\" {\n        helper.BadAuth(c, errMsg, nil)\n        return\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nBecause req.IgnoreCaptcha is taken directly from user input—with no server-side validation, no session binding, and no privilege checks—any unauthenticated attacker can force CAPTCHA validation to be skipped.\n\nThere are no additional conditions, such as:\n\nno requirement for MFA\n\nno trusted device\n\nno IP reputation checks\n\nno prior valid session\n\nno rate limiting\n\nThis results in CAPTCHA being entirely client-controlled, which violates fundamental authentication and anti-automation security assumptions.",
