  "summary": "Out-of-memory vulnerability in github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p",
  "details": "A malicious actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in the memory of a remote node by sending the node a message with a signed peer record. Signed peer records from randomly generated peers can be sent by a malicious actor. This memory does not get garbage collected and so the remote node can run out of memory (OOM).",
