  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker who controls or compromises a registry can lead a user to verify the wrong artifact.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in the release [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6). Users should upgrade their notation-go library to [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6) or above.\n\n### Workarounds\nUser should use secure and trusted container registries.\n\n### Credits\nThe `notation` project would like to thank Adam Korczynski (@AdamKorcz) for responsibly disclosing the issue found during an security audit (facilitated by OSTIF and sponsored by CNCF) and Shiwei Zhang (@shizhMSFT), Pritesh Bandi (@priteshbandi)  for root cause analysis.\n",
