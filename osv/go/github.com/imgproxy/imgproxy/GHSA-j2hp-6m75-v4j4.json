  "summary": "imgproxy is vulnerable to SSRF against 0.0.0.0",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nImgproxy does not block the `0.0.0.0` address, even with `IMGPROXY_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_SOURCE_ADDRESSES` set to false. This can expose services on the local host.\n\n### Details\n\nimgproxy protects against SSRF against a loopback address with the following check ([source](https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy/blob/0f37d62fd8326a32c213b30dd52e2319770885d8/security/source.go#L43C1-L47C1)):\n\n```\nif !config.AllowLoopbackSourceAddresses \u0026\u0026 ip.IsLoopback() {\n\treturn ErrSourceAddressNotAllowed\n}\n```\n\nThis check is insufficient to prevent accessing services on the local host, as services may receive traffic on `0.0.0.0`. Go's `IsLoopback` ([source](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/40b3c0e58a0ae8dec4684a009bf3806769e0fc41/src/net/ip.go#L126-L131)) strictly follows the definition of loopback IPs beginning with `127`. `0.0.0.0` is not blocked.",
