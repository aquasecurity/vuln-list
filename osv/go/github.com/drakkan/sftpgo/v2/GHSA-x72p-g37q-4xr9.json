By gaining access to the session cookie the attacker is for all intents and purposes the valid user and any access to user data would be expected.\n\n~In SFTPGo 2.6.2, the JWT implementation lacks certain security measures, such as using JWT ID (JTI) claims, nonces, and proper expiration and invalidation mechanisms.~",
