  "summary": "SFTPGo vulnerable to recovery codes abuse",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nSFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a seconday authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP.\n\nIn SFTPGo versions from v2.2.0 to v2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication.\nAn attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in v2.3.4.\nRecovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRegenerate recovery codes after enabling two-factor authentication.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/issues/965\n",
