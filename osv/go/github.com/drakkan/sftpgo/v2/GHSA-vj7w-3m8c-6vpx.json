  "summary": "SFTPGo has insufficient sanitization of user provided rsync command",
  "details": "### Impact\nSFTPGo supports execution of a defined set of commands via SSH. Besides a set of default commands some optional commands can be activated, one of them being `rsync`: it is disabled in the default configuration and it is limited to the local filesystem, it does not work with cloud/remote storage backends.\n\nDue to missing sanitization of the client provided `rsync` command, an authenticated remote user can use some options of the rsync command to read or write files with the permissions of the SFTPGo server process. \n\n### Patches\nThis issue was fixed in version v2.6.5 by checking the client provided arguments.\n\nhttps://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b347ab6051f6c501da205c09315fe99cd1fa3ba1",
