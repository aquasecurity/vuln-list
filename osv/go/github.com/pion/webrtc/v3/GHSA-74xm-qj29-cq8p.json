  "summary": "In github.com/pion/webrtc, failed DTLS certificate verification doesn't stop data channel communication",
  "details": "### Impact\nData channel communication was incorrectly allowed with users who have failed DTLS certificate verification.\n\nThis attack requires \n* Attacker knows the ICE password. \n* Only take place during PeerConnection handshake.\n\nThis attack can be detected by monitoring `PeerConnectionState` in all versions of Pion WebRTC.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v3.0.15. \n\nThe exact patch is https://github.com/pion/webrtc/commit/545613dcdeb5dedb01cce94175f40bcbe045df2e\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers should listen for when `PeerConnectionState` changes to `PeerConnectionStateFailed`. When it enters this state users should not continue using the PeerConnection.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/pion/webrtc\n* Email us at [team@pion.ly](mailto:team@pion.ly)\n\nThank you to https://github.com/Gaukas for discovering this.",
