  "summary": "Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when viewing Webhook policies",
  "details": "### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions to view Webhook policies including relevant credentials configured in different projects the user doesn’t have access to, resulting in malicious users being able to read Webhook policies of other users/projects. API call is\n\n  GET /projects/{project_name_or_id}/webhook/policies/{webhook_policy_id}\n\nBy sending the below request and specifying different Webhook policy ids in the last part of the URL, the malicious user may disclose Webhook policies related to other repositories/projects.: none;\"\u003e\n\n### Patches\nThis and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to [Gal Goldstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gal-goldshtein/) and [Daniel Abeles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-abeles/) from [Oxeye Security](https://www.oxeye.io/) for reporting this issue.\n",
