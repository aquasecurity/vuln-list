  "summary": "File Browser's password protection of links is bypassable",
  "details": "## Summary ##\n\nFiles managed by the *File Browser* can be shared with a link to external persons. While the application allows protecting those links with a password, the implementation is error-prone, making an incidental unprotected sharing of a file possible.\n\n## Impact ##\n\nFile owners might rest in the assumption that their shared files are only accessible to persons knowing the defined password, giving them a false sense of security. Meanwhile, attackers gaining access to the unprotected link can use this information alone to download the possibly sensitive file.\n\n## Vulnerability Description ##\n\nWhen sharing a file, the user is presented with a dialog asking for an optional password to protect the file share. The assumption of the user at this point would be, that the shared file won't be accessible without knowledge of the password. After clicking on `SHARE` the following dialog opens allowing the file's owner to copy the share-link:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3add074-40ac-4367-a538-ede5bb526916)\n\nIn fact, there is not one, but two links offered: A `Download Link` and an unnamed second one. They have the following format:\n\n* http://filebrowser.local:8080/share/6Gtw0xAw\n* http://filebrowser.local:8080/api/public/dl/6Gtw0xAw/dummy1.pdf?token=voDK6j[...]\n\nApparently, the first of the two share links is that one that users are supposed to actually share, while the second one is a direct download link not protected by the password. This behavior is not documented anywhere or explained in the GUI, though.\n\nThere are multiple scenarios how an attacker might gain access to the unprotected link and, in consequence, to the shared file:\n\n* The file owner might incidentally share the second link instead of the first one, making it accessible to anyone having read access to the messaging system used (e.g., a mailserver).\n* After the legitimate receiver of the share has used the password, the unprotected link will get linked in multiple locations like the browser history or the log of a proxy server used.\n\n## Proof of Concept ##\n\nUsing the first link results in an authorization error if no password is provided, as expected:\n\n```http hl:9\nGET /api/public/share/6Gtw0xAw HTTP/1.1\nHost: filebrowser.local:8080\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nReferer: http://filebrowser.local:8080/share/6Gtw0xAw\nX-Auth: \nX-SHARE-PASSWORD: \nDNT: 1\nSec-GPC: 1\nConnection: keep-alive\nPriority: u=4\n\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'unsafe-inline';\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nDate: Thu, 27 Mar 2025 10:59:12 GMT\nContent-Length: 17\n\n401 Unauthorized\n```\n\nOnly if the password is provided (via the `X-SHARE-PASSWORD` header), a proper response is given:\n\n```http hl:9\nGET /api/public/share/6Gtw0xAw HTTP/1.1\nHost: filebrowser.local:8080\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nReferer: http://filebrowser.local:8080/share/6Gtw0xAw\nX-Auth: \nX-SHARE-PASSWORD: 1234\nDNT: 1\nSec-GPC: 1\nConnection: keep-alive\nPriority: u=0\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'unsafe-inline';\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nDate: Thu, 27 Mar 2025 10:59:15 GMT\nContent-Length: 301\n\n{\"path\":\"\",\"name\":\"dummy1.pdf\",\"size\":7703,\"extension\":\".pdf\",\"modified\":\"2025-03-27T15:11:45.101242449Z\",\"mode\":420,\"isDir\":false,\"isSymlink\":false,\"type\":\"pdf\",\"token\":\"voDK6j[...]\"}\n```\n\nBut it does not return the actual file content but rather an access token.\nThis is the very same token that is already part of the second share URL and is used by the web application to recreate the actual download URL.\nIf you are in possession of that one, no further password check is performed, and the content of the file is returned:\n\n```http\nGET /api/public/dl/6Gtw0xAw?inline=true\u0026token=voDK6j[...] HTTP/1.1\nHost: filebrowser.local:8080\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nDNT: 1\nSec-GPC: 1\nConnection: keep-alive\nReferer: http://filebrowser.local:8080/share/6Gtw0xAw\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nPriority: u=0, i\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nCache-Control: private\nContent-Disposition: inline\nContent-Length: 7703\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'unsafe-inline';\nContent-Security-Policy: script-src 'none';\nContent-Type: application/pdf\nLast-Modified: Mon, 03 Mar 2025 15:11:45 GMT\nDate: Thu, 27 Mar 2025 10:59:18 GMT\n\n%PDF-1.4\n%Çì¢\n%%Invocation: path/gs -P- -dSAFER -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -q -P- -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sstdout=?
