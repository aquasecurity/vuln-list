  "summary": "Traefik has a possible vulnerability with the path matchers",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nThere is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a `PathPrefix`, `Path` or `PathRegex` matcher.\n\nWhen Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a `/../` in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain.\n\n## Example\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  routes:\n    - match: PathPrefix(‘/service’)\n      kind: Rule\n      services:\n        - name: service-a\n          port: 8080\n      middlewares:\n        - name: my-middleware-a\n    - match: PathPrefix(‘/service/sub-path’)\n      kind: Rule\n      services:\n        - name: service-a\n          port: 8080\n```\n\nIn such a case, the request `http://mydomain.example.com/service/sub-path/../other-path` will reach the backend `my-service-a` without operating the middleware `my-middleware-a` unless the computed path is `http://mydomain.example.com/service/other-path` and should be computes by the first router (operating `my-middleware-a`).\n\n## Patches\n\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.24\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.3.6\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.4.0-rc2\n\n## Workaround\n\nAdd a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.\n\nExample: \n\n```yaml\nmatch: PathPrefix(`/service`) \u0026\u0026 !PathRegexp(`(?:(/\\.\\./)+.*)`)\n```\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).",
