  "summary": "Traefik incorrectly processes fragment in the URL, leads to Authorization Bypass",
  "details": "### Summary\nWhen a request is sent to Traefik with a URL fragment, Traefik automatically URL encodes and forwards the fragment to the backend server. This violates the RFC because in the origin-form the URL should only contain the absolute path and the query.\n\nWhen this is combined with another frontend proxy like Nginx, it can be used to bypass frontend proxy URI-based access control\nrestrictions. \n\n### Details\nFor example, we have this Nginx configuration:\n\n```\nlocation /admin {\n     deny all;\n     return 403;\n}\n```\nThis can be bypassed when the attacker is requesting to /#/../admin\n\nThis wonâ€™t be vulnerable if the backend server follows the RFC and ignores any characters after the fragment.\n\nHowever, if Nginx is chained with another reverse proxy which automatically URL encode the character # (Traefik) the URL will become\n\n/%23/../admin\n\nAnd allow the attacker to completely bypass the Access Restriction from the Nginx Front-End proxy.\n\nHere is a diagram to summarize the attack:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47447167/278849578-34ca0546-99b4-44c8-8fc8-8e799c1f5069.png)\n\n### PoC\n![image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47447167/278849597-280f2e80-f2d7-4dd9-9662-b8f488fd5ff2.png)\n\nThis is the POC docker I've set up.  It contains Nginx, Traefik proxies and a backend server running PHP.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLnA0g7N7ZKhLNmHmuJ4JJjV_J2akNMt/view?usp=sharing\n\n### Impact\nThis allows the attacker to completely bypass the Access Restriction from Front-End proxy.",
