  "summary": "External Secrets Operator insecurely retrieves secrets through the getSecretKey templating function",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe `getSecretKey` template function, while introduced for senhasegura Devops Secrets Management (DSM) provider, has the ability to fetch secrets cross-namespaces with the roleBinding of the external-secrets controller, bypassing our security mechanisms.\n\nThis function was completely removed, as everything done with that templating function can be done in a different way while respecting our safeguards (for example, using `sourceRef` like explained here: https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues/5690#issuecomment-3630977865)\n\n### Impact\n- Cross-namespace secret access: Attackers or misconfigured resources could retrieve secrets from namespaces other than the one intended.\n- privilege escalation: Unauthorized access to secrets could lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or compromise of service accounts and credentials.\n\n### Resolution\n\nWe removed the incriminated templating function from our codebase. All users should upgrade to the latest version containing this fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse a policy engine such as Kubernetes, Kyverno, Kubewarden, or OPA to prevent the usage of `getSecretKey` in any ExternalSecret resource.\n\n### Details\n\nSee also:\n- https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues/5690\n- https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/pull/3895",
