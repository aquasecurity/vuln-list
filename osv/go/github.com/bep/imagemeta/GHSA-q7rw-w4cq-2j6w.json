  "summary": "bep/imagemeta allows excessively large EXIF data structures",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe EXIF data format allows for defining excessively large data structures in relatively small payloads. Before `v0.10.0`, If you didn't trust the input images, this could be abused to construct denial-of-service attacks.\n\n### Patches\n`v0.10.0` added LimitNumTags (default 5000) and LimitTagSize (default 10000) options.",
