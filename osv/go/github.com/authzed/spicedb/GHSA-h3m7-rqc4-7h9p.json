  "summary": "Integer overflow in chunking helper causes dispatching to miss elements or panic",
  "details": "Any SpiceDB cluster with any schema where a resource being checked has more than 65535 relationships for the same resource and subject type is affected by this problem.\n\nThe issue may also lead to a panic rendering the server unavailable\n\nThe following API methods are affected:\n- [CheckPermission](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.CheckPermission)\n- [BulkCheckPermission](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.ExperimentalService.BulkCheckPermission)\n- [LookupSubjects](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.LookupSubjects)\n\n#### Impact\n\nPermission checks that are expected to be allowed are instead denied, and lookup subjects will return fewer subjects than expected.\n\n#### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround other than making sure that the SpiceDB cluster does not have very wide relations, with the maximum value being the maximum value of an 16-bit unsigned integer\n\n#### Remediations\n\n- AuthZed Dedicated customers: No action. AuthZed has upgraded all deployments.\n- AuthZed Serverless customers: No Action. AuthZed has upgraded all deployments.\n- AuthZed Enterprise customers: Upgrade to [v1.29.2-hotfix-enterprise.v1.hotfix.v1](https://github.com/authzed-enterprise/src/pkgs/container/spicedb-enterprise/182719614?tag=v1.29.2-hotfix-enterprise.v1.hotfix.v1)\n - Open Source users: Upgrade to v1.29.2",
