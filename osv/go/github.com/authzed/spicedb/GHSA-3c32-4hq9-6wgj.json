  "summary": "SpiceDB calls to LookupResources using LookupResources2 with caveats may return context is missing when it is not",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nClients that have enabled `LookupResources2` and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied.\n\nLookupResources2 is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0\n\n### Patches\nThe bug will be released as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources` flag by setting it to `false`\n\n```\n--enable-experimental-lookup-resources=false\n```\n",
