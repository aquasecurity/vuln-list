  "summary": "SpiceDB WriteRelationships fails silently if payload is too big",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers who:\n1. Use the exclusion operator somewhere in their authorization schema.\n1. Have configured their SpiceDB server such that `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` is bigger than 6500.\n1. Issue calls to WriteRelationships with a large enough number of updates that cause the payload to be bigger than what their datastore allows.\n\nUsers will:\n\n1. Receive a successful response from their `WriteRelationships` call, when in reality that call failed.\n2. Receive incorrect permission check results, if those relationships had to be read to resolve the relation involving the exclusion.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to v.145.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSet `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` to `1000`.",
