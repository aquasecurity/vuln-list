  "summary": "kube-apiserver authentication bypass vulnerability",
  "details": "An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in kube-apiserver. This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker who has been given permissions \"update, patch\" the \"pods/ephemeralcontainers\" subresource beyond what the default is. They would then need to create a new pod or patch one that they already have access to. This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining control of a privileged pod.",
