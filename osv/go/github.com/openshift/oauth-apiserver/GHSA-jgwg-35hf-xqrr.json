  "summary": "Withdrawn Advisory: OpenShift OAuth Server XSS Vulnerability",
  "details": "## Withdrawn Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the vulnerability does not affect a package in one of the GitHub Advisory Database's [supported ecosystems](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/README.md#supported-ecosystems). This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nA flaw was found in the `/oauth/token/request` custom endpoint of the OpenShift OAuth server allowing for XSS generation of CLI tokens due to missing X-Frame-Options and CSRF protections. If not otherwise prevented, a separate XSS vulnerability via JavaScript could further allow for the extraction of these tokens.",
