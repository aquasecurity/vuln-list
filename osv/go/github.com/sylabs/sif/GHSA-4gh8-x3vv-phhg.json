  "summary": "Predictable SIF UUID Identifiers in github.com/sylabs/sif",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe `siftool new` command and [func siftool.New()](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sylabs/sif/pkg/siftool#New) produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch is available in version \u003e= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade.\n\nThe patch is commit https://github.com/sylabs/sif/commit/193962882122abf85ff5f5bcc86404933e71c07d\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers passing [CreateInfo struct](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sylabs/sif/pkg/sif#CreateInfo) should ensure the `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue. Unfortunately, the latest tagged release is vulnerable to this issue. One way to obtain a non-vulnerable version is:\n\n```\ngo get github.com/satori/go.uuid@75cca531ea763666bc46e531da3b4c3b95f64557\n```\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/satori/go.uuid/issues/73\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github.com/sylabs/sif](https://github.com/sylabs/sif/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@sylabs.io](mailto:security@sylabs.io)\n",
