  "details": "There's an security issue in prosody-filer versions **\u003c 1.0.1** which leads to unwanted directory listings of download directories. \n\nAn attacker is able to list previous uploads of a certain user by shortening the URL and accessing a URL subdirectors other than `/upload/` (or the corresponding user defined root dir)\n\nVersion 1.0.1 and later fix this problem and allow only direct file access if the full path is known. Directory listings are blocked entirely.",
