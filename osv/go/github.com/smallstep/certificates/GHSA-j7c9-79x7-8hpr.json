  "summary": "step-ca Has Improper Authorization Check for SSH Certificate Revocation",
  "details": "## Summary\nAn authorized attacker can bypass authorization checks and revoke any SSH certificate issued by Step CA by using a valid revocation token.\n\n## Details\nStep CA users can obtain SSH certificates from a few provisioners. The SSHPOP provisioner allows revocation of the SSH certificate (preventing future certificate renewals) using a token. Due to a missing validity check, this token could be used to revoke any SSH certificate issued by the CA.\n\nTo create a token, an attacker must have access to the CA endpoint and a valid SSH certificate, meaning they were already authorized to obtain an SSH certificate. The attacker must also know the serial number of the certificate they want to revoke.\n\n## Impact\nThere is no way to mitigate this attack. It is recommended to update to v0.29.0 or newer.\n\n## Fix\nIn v0.29.0, the token validation logic was strengthened to bind each token to a specific SSH certificate serial number.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThis issue was identified and reported by Gabriel Departout and Andy Russon, from [AMOSSYS](http://amossys.fr/). This audit was sponsored by [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/) (French Cybersecurity Agency) based on [their Open-Source security audit program](https://cyber.gouv.fr/open-source-lanssi#:~:text=Financement%20d%27%C3%A9valuations%20de%20s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9%20de%20logiciels%20libres).\n\n## Embargo List\n\nIf your organization runs Step CA in production and would like advance, embargoed notification of future security updates, visit https://u.step.sm/disclosure to request inclusion on our embargo list.\n\nStay safe, and thank you for helping us keep the ecosystem secure.",
