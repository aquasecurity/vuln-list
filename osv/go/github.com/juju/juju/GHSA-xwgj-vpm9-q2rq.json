  "summary": "Vulnerable juju introspection abstract UNIX domain socket",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn abstract UNIX domain socket responsible for introspection is available without authentication locally to any user with access to the network namespace where the local juju agent is running.\n\nOn a juju controller agent, denial of service can be performed by using the `/leases/revoke` endpoint. Revoking leases in juju can cause availability issues.\n\nOn a juju machine agent that is hosting units, disabling the unit component can be performed using the `/units` endpoint with a \"stop\" action.\n\n### Patches\nPatch: https://github.com/juju/juju/commit/43f0fc59790d220a457d4d305f484f62be556d3b\nPatched in:\n- 3.5.4\n- 3.4.6\n- 3.3.7\n- 3.1.10\n- 2.9.51\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workaround.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/juju/juju/blob/725800953aaa29dbeda4f806097bf838e61644dd/worker/introspection/worker.go#L125\n",
