  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-mh98-763h-m9v4. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nJUJU_CONTEXT_ID is a predictable authentication secret. On a Juju machine (non-Kubernetes) or Juju charm container (on Kubernetes), an unprivileged user in the same network namespace can connect to an abstract domain socket and guess the JUJU_CONTEXT_ID value. This gives the unprivileged user access to the same information and tools as the Juju charm.",
