  "details": "Overview\nOpenFGA v1.8.4 or previous (Helm chart \u003c openfga-0.2.22, docker \u003c v.1.8.5) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.\n\nAm I Affected?\nIf you are using OpenFGA v1.8.4 or previous, specifically under the following conditions, you are affected by this authorization bypass vulnerability:\n\n- Calling Check API or ListObjects with a model that has a relation [directly assignable](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-a-directly-related-user-type) to both [public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) AND [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-a-user) with the [same type](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-a-type), and\n- A type bound public access tuple is assigned to an object, and\n- userset tuple is not assigned to the same object, and\n- Check request's user field is a userset that has the same type as the type bound public access tuple's user type\n\n\nFix\nUpgrade to v1.8.5. This upgrade is backwards compatible.",
