  "summary": "rootless: `/sys/fs/cgroup` is writable when cgroupns isn't unshared in runc",
  "details": "### Impact\nIt was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons:\n1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl)\n2. or, when runc is executed outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare)\n\nA container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host .\nOther users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected.\n\n### Patches\nv1.1.5 (planned)\n\n### Workarounds\n- Condition 1: Unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts.\n- Condition 2 (very rare): add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`\n",
