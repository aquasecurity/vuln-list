  "summary": "Go-Guerrilla SMTP Daemon allows the PROXY command to be sent multiple times",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe PROXY command is accepted multiple times, allowing a client to spoof its IP address when the proxy protocol is being used.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen ProxyOn is enabled, [it looks like the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times](https://github.com/phires/go-guerrilla/blob/fca3b2d8957a746997c7e71fca39004f5c96e91f/server.go#L495), with later invocations overriding earlier ones.  The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header; anything after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server, so the client is free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases.  go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to spoof its IP address.\n\nNote that the format of the PROXY header is [well-defined](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt).  It probably shouldn't be treated as an SMTP command; parsing it the same way is likely to result in odd behavior and could lead to other vulnerabilities.\n\n### PoC\n\nI'm working on writing a PR to fix this vulnerability.  It'll include a unit test that will serve as a PoC on the current version.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny instance with `ProxyOn` enabled (`proxyon` in the JSON config) is affected.\n\nAs far as I'm able to tell, the impact is limited to spoofing the `RemoteIP` field.  This isn't ideal, but it probably has less practical impact on an MTA than, say, a web server.",
