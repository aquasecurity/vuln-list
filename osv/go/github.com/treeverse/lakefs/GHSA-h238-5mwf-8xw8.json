  "summary": "lakeFS affected by unauthenticated access to API usage metrics",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nMissing authentication in the `/api/v1/usage-report/summary` endpoint allows anyone to retrieve aggregate API usage counts. While no sensitive data is disclosed, the endpoint may reveal information about service activity or uptime.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to \u003ev1.70.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAny **ONE** of these is sufficient to block this reporting:\n- Disable usage reporting by setting configuration option `usage_report.enabled` or environment variable `LAKEFS_USAGE_REPORT_ENABLED` to `false`.\n- Using load-balancer or application level firewall - blocking the request route /api/v1/usage-report/summary.",
