  "summary": "lakeFS is Missing Timestamp Validation in S3 Gateway Authentication",
  "details": "### Impact\nLakeFS's S3 gateway does not validate timestamps in authenticated requests, allowing replay attacks. An attacker who captures a valid signed request (e.g., through network interception, logs, or compromised systems) can replay that request until credentials are rotated, even after the request is intended to expire.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue affects all versions of lakeFS up to and including v1.74.4.\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in version v1.75.0.\n\nUsers should upgrade to version v1.75.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUntil upgraded, implement these mitigations:\n\n- **Use short-lived credentials** - Rotate access keys frequently and **deactivate old keys**. For regular requests, captured requests only work until rotation. For presigned URLs, they remain valid until the credentials used to create them are deactivated.\n- **Network controls** - Restrict S3 gateway access to trusted networks/IPs to limit where replay attacks can originate.\n\nNote: These workarounds reduce risk but do not fully eliminate the vulnerability.\n\n### References\n- Original issue: https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/issues/9599\n- AWS Signature V4 Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html\n- AWS Signature V4 S3 Requests: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html\n- AWS Signature V2 Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html",
