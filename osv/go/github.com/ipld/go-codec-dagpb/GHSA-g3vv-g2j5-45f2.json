  "summary": "ipld/go-codec-dagpb panics when processing certain blocks",
  "details": "### Impact \nDecoding certain blocks using the go-ipld-prime version of the dag-pb codec (go-codec-dagpb) can cause a panic.  The panic comes from an assumption that the reported link length is accurate, but if the block ends before that reported length then itâ€™s a buffer overread.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in v1.3.1 and above.\n\nConsumers can discover the versions of `go-codec-dagpb` in a module's dependency graph using the following command in the module root:\n\n```go mod graph | grep go-codec-dagpb```\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can work around this issue without upgrading by recovering panics higher in the call stack of the goroutine that calls the defective code.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Ask in [IPFS Discord #ipld-chatter](https://discord.gg/ipfs)\n* Open an issue in [go-codec-dagpb](https://github.com/ipld/go-codec-dagpb)",
