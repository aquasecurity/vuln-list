  "summary": "Improper validation of UUIDs in github.com/codenotary/immudb",
  "details": "A malicious server can trick a client into treating it as a different server by changing the reported UUID.\n\nimmudb client SDKs use the server's UUID to distinguish between different server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers. The SDK does not validate this UUID and accepts any value reported by the server. A malicious server can therefore change the reported UUID and trick the client into treating it as a different server.",
