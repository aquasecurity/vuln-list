  "summary": "KubeEdge Cloud AdmissionController component DoS",
  "details": "### Impact\nSeveral endpoints including `/devicemodels`, `/rules`, `/ruleendpoints`, `/offlinemigration` in the Cloud Admissioncontroller may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it.\nOnly an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected when users deploy a Cloud Admissioncontroller. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud Admissioncontroller will be in denial of service.\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nAt the time of writing, no workaround exists.\n\n### References\nNA\n\n### Credits\nThanks David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [kubeedge security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy) during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [KubeEdge repo](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/new/choose)\n* To make a vulnerability report, email your vulnerability to the private [cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io) list with the security details and the details expected for [KubeEdge bug reports](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).\n",
