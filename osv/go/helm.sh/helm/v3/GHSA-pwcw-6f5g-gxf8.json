  "summary": "Helm vulnerable to information disclosure via getHostByName Function ",
  "details": "A Helm contributor discovered an information disclosure vulnerability using the `getHostByName` template function.\n\n### Impact\n\n`getHostByName` is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart.\n\nInformation passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPrior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers.\n\n### For more information\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Philipp Stehle at SAP.",
