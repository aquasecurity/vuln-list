  "summary": "Helm vulnerable to denial of service through through repository index file",
  "details": "Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the `_repo_` package that can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the `_repo_` package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `_repo_` package contains a handler that processes the index file of a repository. For example, the Helm client adds references to chart repositories where charts are managed. The `_repo_` package parses the index file of the repository and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some index files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.\n\nApplications that use the `_repo_` package in the Helm SDK to parse an index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.10.3. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nSDK users can validate index files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the `_repo_` functions.\n\n### For more information\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.",
