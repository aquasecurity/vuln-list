  "summary": "Aliases are never checked in helm",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nDuring a security audit of Helm's code base, security researchers at Trail of Bits identified a bug in which the `alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\nhelm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/chartutil\n\n### Workarounds\n\nManually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters.",
