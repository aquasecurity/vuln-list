  "summary": "Helm May Panic Due To Incorrect YAML Content",
  "details": "A Helm contributor discovered an improper validation of type error when parsing Chart.yaml and index.yaml files that can lead to a panic.\n\n### Impact\n\nThere are two areas of YAML validation that were impacted. First, when a `Chart.yaml` file had a `null` maintainer or the `child` or `parent` of a dependencies `import-values` could be parsed as something other than a string, `helm lint` would panic. Second, when an `index.yaml` had an empty entry in the list of chart versions Helm would panic on interactions with that repository.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure YAML files are formatted as Helm expects prior to processing them with Helm.\n\n### References\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Jakub Ciolek at AlphaSense.",
