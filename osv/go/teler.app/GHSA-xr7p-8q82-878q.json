  "summary": "teler dashboard vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS)",
  "details": "### Description\n\nteler prior to version \u003c= 2.0.0-rc.4 is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) in the teler dashboard. When teler requests messages from the event stream on the `/events` endpoint, the log data displayed on the dashboard are not sanitized.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis only affects authenticated users and can only be exploited based on detected threats if the log contains a DOM scripting payload. This indicates a low severity and there is no significant impact on the users.\n\n### Affected Version\n\nThis issue was introduced from version `v2.0.0-rc` to `v2.0.0-rc.3` \u0026 `v2.0.0-dev`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed on version `v2.0.0-rc.4` \u0026 `v2.0.0-dev.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nHere are some workarounds to handle this case:\n- Deactivate the live event dashboard from the configuration file, or\n- Upgrade teler version to `v2.0.0-rc.4` or `v2.0.0-dev.2` \u0026 above.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/commit/20f59eda2420ac64e29f199a61230a0abc875e8e\n",
