  "summary": "gRPC-Go HTTP/2 Rapid Reset vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn affected releases of gRPC-Go, it is possible for an attacker to send HTTP/2 requests, cancel them, and send subsequent requests, which is valid by the HTTP/2 protocol, but would cause the gRPC-Go server to launch more concurrent method handlers than the configured maximum stream limit.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability was addressed by #6703 and has been included in patch releases: 1.56.3, 1.57.1, 1.58.3.  It is also included in the latest release, 1.59.0.\n\nAlong with applying the patch, users should also ensure they are using the `grpc.MaxConcurrentStreams` server option to apply a limit to the server's resources used for any single connection.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n#6703\n",
