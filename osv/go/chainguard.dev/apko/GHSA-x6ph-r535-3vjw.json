  "summary": "apko is vulnerable to attack through incorrect permissions in /etc/ld.so.cache and other files",
  "details": "It was discovered that the ld.so.cache in images generated by apko had file system permissions mode `0666`:\n```\nbash-5.3# find / -type f -perm -o+w\n/etc/ld.so.cache\n```\n\nThis issue was introduced in commit [04f37e2 (\"generate /etc/ld.so.cache (#1629)\")](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/04f37e2d50d5a502e155788561fb7d40de705bd9)([v0.27.0](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/releases/tag/v0.27.0)).\n\n###  Impact\nThis potentially allows a local unprivileged user to add additional additional directories including dynamic libraries to the dynamic loader path. A user could exploit this by placing a malicious library in a directory they control.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was addressed in apko in [aedb077 (\"fix: /etc/ld.so.cache file permissions (#1758)\")](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/aedb0772d6bf6e74d8f17690946dbc791d0f6af3) ([v0.29.5](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/releases/tag/v0.29.5)).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to Cody Harris from [H2O.ai](http://h2o.ai/) for reporting this issue.",
