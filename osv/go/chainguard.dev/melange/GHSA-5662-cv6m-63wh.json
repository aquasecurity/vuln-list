  "summary": "melange's world-writable permissions expose SBOM files to potential image tampering",
  "details": "It was discovered that the SBOM files generated by melange in apks had file system permissions mode 666:\n```\n$ apkrane ls https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz -P hello-wolfi --full --latest  | xargs wget -q -O  - | tar tzv 2\u003e/dev/null var/lib/db/sbom\ndrwxr-xr-x root/root         0 2025-06-23 14:17 var/lib/db/sbom\n-rw-rw-rw- root/root      3383 2025-06-23 14:17 var/lib/db/sbom/hello-wolfi-2.12.2-r1.spdx.json\n```\n\nThis issue was introduced in commit 1b272db (\"Persist workspace filesystem throughout package builds (#1836)\") ([v0.23.0](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/releases/tag/v0.23.0)).\n\n### Impact\nThis potentially allows an unprivileged user to tamper with apk SBOMs on a running image, potentially confusing security scanners. An attacker could also perform a DoS under special circumstances.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was addressed in melange in e29494b (\"fix: tighten up permissions for written SBOM files and signature tarballs (#2086)\") ([v0.29.5](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/releases/tag/v0.29.5)).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Cody Harris [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/) and Markus Boehme for independently reporting this issue.",
