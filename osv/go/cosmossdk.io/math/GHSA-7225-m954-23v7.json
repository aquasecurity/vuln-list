  "details": "Name: ASA-2024-010: Mismatched bit-length in `sdk.Int` and `sdk.Dec` can lead to panic \nComponent: Cosmos SDK / Math\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact, and Possible Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: `cosmossdk.io/math` package versions \u003c= `math/v1.3.0`\nAffected users: Chain Builders + Maintainers, Validators\n\n### Impact\n\nThe bit-length in `sdk.Int` and `sdk.Dec` are not aligned, which may present a possible panic condition when interacting with `Dec` types in an `Int` context. This issue was resolved by aligning the max size between the data types in the cosmossdk.io/math package.\n\nThis issue impacts consumers of the cosmossdk.io/math, which includes popular modules including IBC-Go and tokenfactory (permissionless). If your chain interacts with APIs in the cosmossdk.io/math package, or utilizes a module that consumes this library, it is advised to update to the latest version at the time of the patch release by updating your project's go.mod dependency for cosmossdk.io/math.\n\nThe patch can be applied without a hard-fork, and with a version bump in a chain's go.mod file like the following:\n\n#### `go.mod`\n\n```diff\n- cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0\n+ cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0\n```\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]  \n\u003e When on a lower version than cosmossdk.io/math v1.3.0, please do a coordinated upgrade before upgrading to \u003e= 1.3.0\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new release of `cosmossdk.io/math v1.4.0` resolves this issue.  Chains that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library or modules that utilize the cosmossdk.io/math library should update to avoid this condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* October 31, 2024, 6:55pm UTC: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* October 31, 2024, 8:56pm UTC: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* Nov 15, 2024, 2:12am PST: Core team completes patch for issue\n* Nov 19, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Pre-notification delivered\n* Nov 20, 2024, 8:00am PST / 16:00 GMT: Patch made available\n\n\nThis issue was reported by LonelySloth to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on October 31, 2024.
