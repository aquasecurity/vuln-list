  "summary": "Etcd embed auto compaction retention negative value causing a compaction loop or a crash",
  "details": "### Impact\nData Validation\n\n### Detail\nThe parseCompactionRetention function in embed/etcd.go allows the retention variable value to be negative and causes the node to execute the history compaction in a loop, taking more CPU than usual and spamming logs.\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md#product-security-committee-psc)",
