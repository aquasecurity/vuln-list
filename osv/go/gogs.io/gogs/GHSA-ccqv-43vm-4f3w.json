  "summary": "Gogs allows deletion of internal files",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUnprivileged user accounts can execute arbitrary commands on the Gogs instance with the privileges of the account specified by `RUN_USER` in the configuration. It allows attackers to access and alter any users' code hosted on the same instance.\n\n### Patches\n\nDeletion of `.git` files has been prohibited (https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/7870). Users should upgrade to 0.13.1 or the latest 0.14.0+dev.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo viable workaround available, please only grant access to trusted users to your Gogs instance on affected versions.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39931\n",
