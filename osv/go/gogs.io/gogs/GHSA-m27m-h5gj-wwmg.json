  "summary": "Gogs allows argument Injection when tagging new releases",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUnprivileged user accounts with at least one SSH key can read arbitrary files on the system. For instance, they could leak the configuration files that could contain database credentials (`[database] *`) and `[security] SECRET_KEY`. Attackers could also exfiltrate TLS certificates, other users' repositories, and the Gogs database when the SQLite driver is enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nUnintended Git options has been ignored for creating tags (https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/7872). Users should upgrade to 0.13.1 or the latest 0.14.0+dev.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo viable workaround available, please only grant access to trusted users to your Gogs instance on affected versions.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39933\n",
