  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-gw5h-h6hj-f56g. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n### Impact\n\nExpired PAM accounts and accounts with expired passwords are continued to be seen as valid. Installations use PAM as authentication sources are affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nExpired PAM accounts and accounts with expired passwords are no longer being seen as valid. Users should upgrade to 0.12.5 or the latest 0.13.0+dev.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn addition to marking PAM accounts as expired, also disable/lock them. Running `usermod -L \u003cusername\u003e` will add an exclamation mark to the password hash and would result in wrong passwords responses when trying to login. \n\n### References\n\nhttps://huntr.dev/bounties/ea82cfc9-b55c-41fe-ae58-0d0e0bd7ab62/\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please post on https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/6810.\n",
