  "summary": "Cross-site scripting in net/http/cgi and net/http/fcgi",
  "details": "When a Handler does not explicitly set the Content-Type header, the the package would default to “text/html”, which could cause a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability if an attacker can control any part of the contents of a response.\n\nThe Content-Type header is now set based on the contents of the first Write using http.DetectContentType, which is consistent with the behavior of the net/http package.\n\nAlthough this protects some applications that validate the contents of uploaded files, not setting the Content-Type header explicitly on any attacker-controlled file is unsafe and should be avoided.",
