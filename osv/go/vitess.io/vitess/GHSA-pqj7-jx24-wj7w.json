  ],
  "summary": "VTAdmin users that can create shards can deny access to other functions",
  "details": "### Impact\nUsers can either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. \nAttempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work.\nCreating a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI validates the input correctly.\n\n### Patches\nv16.0.2, corresponding to [0.16.2 on pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess@v0.16.2)\n\n### Workarounds\n- Always use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin\n- Disable creating shards from VTAdmin using RBAC\n- Delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client for your topology server. For example, if you created a shard called `a/b` in keyspace `commerce`, and you are running etcd, it can be deleted by doing something like\n```\n% etcdctl --endpoints \"http://${ETCD_SERVER}\" del /vitess/global/keyspaces/commerce/shards/a/b/Shard\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12842\n\nFound during a security audit sponsored by the [CNCF](https://cncf.io) and facilitated by [OSTIF](https://ostif.org).",
