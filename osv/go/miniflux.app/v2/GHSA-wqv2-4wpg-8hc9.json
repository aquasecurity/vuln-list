  ],
  "summary": "Miniflux has an Open Redirect via protocol-relative redirect_url",
  "details": "### Summary\n`redirect_url` is treated as safe when `url.Parse(...).IsAbs()` is false. Protocol-relative URLs like `//ikotaslabs.com` have an empty scheme and pass that check, allowing post-login redirects to attacker-controlled sites.\n\n### Details\n- `url.Parse(\"//ikotaslabs.com\")` =\u003e empty Scheme, Host=\"ikotaslabs.com\".\n- `IsAbs()` returns false for `//ikotaslabs.com`, so the code treats it as allowed.\n- Browser resolves `//ikotaslabs.com` to current-origin scheme (e.g. `https://ikotaslabs.com`), enabling phishing flows after login.\n\n### PoC\n1. Send or visit: `http://localhost/login?redirect_url=//ikotaslabs.com`  \n2. Complete normal login flow.  \n3. After login the app redirects to `https://ikotaslabs.com` (or `http://` depending on origin).\n\n### Acknowledgements  \nThis vulnerability was discovered using the automated vulnerability analysis tools **VulScribe** and **PwnML**.  \nThe research and tool development were conducted with support from the **MITOU Advanced Program (未踏アドバンスト事業)**,  \nadministered by the **Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), Japan**.",
