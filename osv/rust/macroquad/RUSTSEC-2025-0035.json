  "details": "Several soundness issues have been reported. Resolving them doesn't seem to be considered a priority. In particular, unprincipled use of\nmutable statics is pervasive throughout the library, making it possible to cause use-after-free in safe code.\n\nCurrently, no fixed version is available.",
