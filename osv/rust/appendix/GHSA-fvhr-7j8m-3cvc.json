  "summary": "Data races in appendix",
  "details": "The `appendix` crate implements a key-value mapping data structure called\n`Index\u003cK, V\u003e` that is stored on disk. The crate allows for any type to inhabit\nthe generic `K` and `V` type parameters and implements Send and Sync for them\nunconditionally.\n\nUsing a type that is not marked as `Send` or `Sync` with `Index` can allow it\nto be used across multiple threads leading to data races. Additionally using\nreference types for the keys or values will lead to the segmentation faults\nin the crate's code.",
