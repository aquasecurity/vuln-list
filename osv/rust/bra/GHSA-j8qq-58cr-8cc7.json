  "details": "Buffered Random Access (BRA) provides easy random memory access to a sequential source of data in Rust. This is achieved by greedily retaining all memory read from a given source. Buffered Random Access (BRA) provides easy random memory access to a sequential source of data in Rust. An issue was discovered in the bra crate before 0.1.1 for Rust. It lacks soundness because it can read uninitialized memory.",
