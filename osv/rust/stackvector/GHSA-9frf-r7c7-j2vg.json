  "summary": "Out of bounds write in stackvector",
  "details": "StackVec::extend used the lower and upper bounds from an Iterator's size_hint to determine how many items to push into the stack based vector. If the size_hint implementation returned a lower bound that was larger than the upper bound, StackVec would write out of bounds and overwrite memory on the stack. As mentioned by the size_hint documentation, size_hint is mainly for optimization and incorrect implementations should not lead to memory safety issues.",
