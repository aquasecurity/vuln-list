  "summary": "OpenVM allows the byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip to overflow",
  "details": "The fix to https://cantina.xyz/code/c486d600-bed0-4fc6-aed1-de759fd29fa2/findings/21 has a typo that still results in the highest limb of `pc` being range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits.\n\nIn the AIR, we do https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/blob/0f94c8a3dfa7536c1231465d1bdee5fc607a5993/extensions/rv32im/circuit/src/auipc/core.rs#L135\n```\n        for (i, limb) in pc_limbs.iter().skip(1).enumerate() {\n            if i == pc_limbs.len() - 1 {\n```\n\nIt should be\n```\n        for (i, limb) in pc_limbs.iter().enumerate().skip(1) {\n```\n\nRight now the if statement is never triggered because the enumeration gives `i=0,1,2` when we instead want `i=1,2,3`. What this means is that `pc_limbs[3]` is range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits.\n\nThis leads to a vulnerability where the `pc_limbs` decomposition differs from the true `pc`, which means a malicious prover can make the destination register take a different value than the AUIPC instruction dictates, by making the decomposition overflow the BabyBear field.",
