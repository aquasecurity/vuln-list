  "details": "The rustls-pemfile crate is no longer maintained. The repository has been archived since August\n2025, and users are encouraged to depend directly on the underlying PEM parsing code included\nin rustls-pki-types since 1.9.0. The latest version of rustls-pemfile is in fact a thin wrapper\naround the same code used in rustls-pki-types, so migrating should be straightforward.\n\nThe new API is represented by the [`PemObject`][PemObject] trait, which provides methods for\nreading a single or multiple PEM objects from a file or byte slice.\n\n[PemObject]: https://docs.rs/rustls-pki-types/latest/rustls_pki_types/pem/trait.PemObject.html",
