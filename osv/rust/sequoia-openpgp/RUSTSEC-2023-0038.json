  "summary": "Out-of-bounds array access leads to panic",
  "details": "Affected versions of the crate have several bugs where\nattacker-controlled input can result in the use of an out-of-bound\narray index.  Rust detects the use of the out-of-bound index and\ncauses the application to panic.  An attacker may be able to use this\nto cause a denial-of-service.  However, it is not possible for an\nattacker to read from or write to the application's address space.",
