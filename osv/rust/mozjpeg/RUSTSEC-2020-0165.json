  "details": "This issue and vector is similar to [RUSTSEC-2020-0029] of `rgb` crate which `mozjpeg` depends on.\n\nAffected versions of `mozjpeg` crate allow creating instances of any type `T` from bytes,\nand do not correctly constrain `T` to the types for which it is safe to do so.\n\nExamples of safety violation possible for a type `T`:\n\n* `T` contains a reference type, and it constructs a pointer to an invalid, arbitrary memory address.\n* `T` requires a safety and/or validity invariant for its construction that may be violated.\n\nThe issue was fixed in 0.8.19 by using safer types and involving `rgb` dependency bump.\n\n[RUSTSEC-2020-0029]: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0029.html",
