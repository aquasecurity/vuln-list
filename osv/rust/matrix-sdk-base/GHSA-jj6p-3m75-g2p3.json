  "summary": " matrix-sdk-base denial of service via custom m.room.join_rules event values",
  "details": "The matrix-sdk-base crate is unable to handle responses that include custom m.room.join_rules values due to a serialization bug.\n\nThis can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition, if a user is invited to a room with non-standard join rules, the crate's sync process will stall, preventing further processing for all rooms.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in matrix-sdk-base 0.16.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers can leave affected rooms on another client to mitigate the issue.\n\n### References\n\nThe issue was fixed in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5924.",
