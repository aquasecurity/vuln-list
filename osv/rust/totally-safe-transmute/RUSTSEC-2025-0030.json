  "details": "This crate is a toy and should never be used.\n\nIt showcases a known soundness issue (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32670) that will never get fixed. In short, Linux provides a file called `/proc/self/mem` which can be used by a program to modify its own memory. This library modifies an enum variant number by accessing its own memory as a file to effectively transmute a variable.\n\nSee also \u003chttps://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/io/index.html#procselfmem-and-similar-os-features\u003e",
