  "summary": "An integer underflow could lead to panic",
  "details": "A mistake in error handling in untrusted before 0.6.2 could lead to an integer\nunderflow and panic if a user of the crate didn't properly check for errors\nreturned by untrusted.\n\nCombination of these two programming errors (one in untrusted and another by\nuser of this crate) could lead to a panic and maybe a denial of service of\naffected software.\n\nThe error in untrusted is fixed in release 0.6.2 released 2018-06-21. It's also\nadvisable that users of untrusted check for their sources for cases where errors\nreturned by untrusted are not handled correctly.",
