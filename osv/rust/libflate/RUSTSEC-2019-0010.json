  "summary": "MultiDecoder::read() drops uninitialized memory of arbitrary type on panic in client code",
  "details": "Affected versions of libflate have set a field of an internal structure with a generic type to an uninitialized value in `MultiDecoder::read()` and reverted it to the original value after the function completed. However, execution of `MultiDecoder::read()` could be interrupted by a panic in caller-supplied `Read` implementation. This would cause `drop()` to be called on uninitialized memory of a generic type implementing `Read`.\n\nThis is equivalent to a use-after-free vulnerability and could allow an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by aborting immediately instead of unwinding the stack in case of panic within `MultiDecoder::read()`. The issue was discovered and fixed by Shnatsel.",
