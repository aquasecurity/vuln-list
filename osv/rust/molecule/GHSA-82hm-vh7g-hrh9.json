  "summary": "Partial read is incorrect in molecule",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAnyone who uses `total_size(..)` function to partial read the length of any `FixVec` will get an incorrect result, due to an incorrect implementation. This has been resolved in the 0.7.2 release.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you already have the whole `FixVec` `A`, you can use `A.as_slice().len()` to get the total size of the `FixVec`.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- [Open an issue to ask use directly](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/issues/new).",
