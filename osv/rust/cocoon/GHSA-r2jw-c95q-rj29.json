  "details": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6878-6wc2-pf5h. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nVersions of the package cocoon before 0.4.0 are vulnerable to Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption when the encrypt, wrap, and dump functions are sequentially called. An attacker can generate the same ciphertext by creating a new encrypted message with the same cocoon object.\n\n**Note:**\nThe issue does NOT affect objects created with Cocoon::new which utilizes ThreadRng.",
