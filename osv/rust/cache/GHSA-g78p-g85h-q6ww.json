  "summary": "Data races in cache",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the cache crate through 2020-11-24 for Rust. \nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `Cache\u003cK\u003e`.\nThis allows users to insert `K` that is not Send or not Sync.\n\nThis allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc\u003cCell\u003cT\u003e\u003e` or `Rc\u003cT\u003e` as `K` in `Cache\u003cK\u003e`. It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell\u003cT\u003e` or `RefCell\u003cT\u003e` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption.\n",
