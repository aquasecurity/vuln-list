  "summary": "move_elements can double-free objects on panic",
  "details": "Affected versions of scratchpad used ptr::read to read elements while calling a user provided function f on them. Since the pointer read duplicates ownership, a panic inside the user provided f function could cause a double free when unwinding.\n\nThe flaw was fixed in commit `891561bea` by removing the unsafe block and using a plain iterator.",
