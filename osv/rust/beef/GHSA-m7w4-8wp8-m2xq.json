  "summary": "Data races in beef",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the beef crate before 0.5.0 for Rust. \nAffected versions of this crate did not have a `T: Sync` bound in the `Send` impl for `Cow\u003c'_, T, U\u003e`. This allows users to create data races by making `Cow` contain types that are (Send \u0026\u0026 !Sync) like `Cell\u003c_\u003e` or `RefCell\u003c_\u003e`.\n\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit d1c7658 by adding trait bounds `T: Sync` and `T::Owned: Send` to the `Send` impl for `Cow\u003c'_, T, U\u003e`.\n",
