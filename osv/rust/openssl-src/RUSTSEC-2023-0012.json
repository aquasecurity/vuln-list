  "summary": "`NULL` dereference validating DSA public key",
  "details": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an\napplication tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the\n`EVP_PKEY_public_check()` function. This will most likely lead\nto an application crash. This function can be called on public\nkeys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker\nto cause a denial of service attack.\n\nThe TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function\nbut applications might call the function if there are additional\nsecurity requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.",
