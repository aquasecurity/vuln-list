  "summary": "Invalid handling of `X509_verify_cert()` internal errors in libssl",
  "details": "Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls `X509_verify_cert()` on the client side to\nverify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative\nreturn value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a\nnegative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function\n(such as `SSL_connect()` or `SSL_do_handshake()`) to not indicate success and a\nsubsequent call to `SSL_get_error()` to return the value\n`SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY`. This return value is only supposed to be returned\nby OpenSSL if the application has previously called\n`SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback()`. Since most applications do not do this the\n`SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY` return value from `SSL_get_error()` will be totally\nunexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact\nbehaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes,\ninfinite loops or other similar incorrect responses.\n\nThis issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL\n3.0 that will cause `X509_verify_cert()` to indicate an internal error when\nprocessing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not\ninclude the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority\nhas enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains.",
