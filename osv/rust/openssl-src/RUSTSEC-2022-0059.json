  "summary": "Using a Custom Cipher with `NID_undef` may lead to NULL encryption",
  "details": "OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()`\nfunction and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL\n3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider\nmechanism in order to implement custom ciphers.\n\nOpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed\nto the `EVP_EncryptInit_ex2()`, `EVP_DecryptInit_ex2()` and `EVP_CipherInit_ex2()`\nfunctions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption\ninitialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it\nincorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers.\nAn equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()`.\nThis NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it\nis possible for an application to incorrectly pass `NID_undef` as this value in\nthe call to `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()`. When `NID_undef` is used in this way the\nOpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher\nas being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will\nsucceed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider\nhas been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the\nplaintext is emitted as the ciphertext.\n\nApplications are only affected by this issue if they call `EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()`\nusing `NID_undef` and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption\ninitialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by\nthis issue.",
