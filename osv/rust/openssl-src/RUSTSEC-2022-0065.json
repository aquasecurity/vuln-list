  "summary": "X.509 Email Address Variable Length Buffer Overflow",
  "details": "A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,\nspecifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after\ncertificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to\nhave signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue\ncertificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted\nissuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate\nto overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character\n(decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash\n(causing a denial of service).\n\nIn a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious\nserver. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests\nclient authentication and a malicious client connects.",
