  "summary": "HeaderMap::Drain API is unsound",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate incorrectly used raw pointer,\nwhich introduced unsoundness in its public safe API.\n\n[Failing to drop the Drain struct causes double-free](https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/354),\nand [it is possible to violate Rust's alias rule and cause data race with Drain's Iterator implementation](https://github.com/hyperium/http/issues/355).\n\nThe flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of `http` crate.",
