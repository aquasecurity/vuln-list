  "summary": "Apollo Compiler Named Fragment Processing Vulnerability",
  "details": "# Impact\n\n## Summary\n\nA vulnerability in Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service in applications.\n\n## Details\n\nNamed fragments were being processed once per fragment spread in some cases during query validation, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved.\n\n## Fix/Mitigation\n\nThe validation logic has been updated to process each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal.\n\n# Patches\nThis has been remediated in `apollo-compiler` version 1.27.0.\n\n# Workarounds\nNo known direct workarounds exist.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nWe appreciate the efforts of the security community in identifying and improving the performance and security of query validation mechanisms.",
