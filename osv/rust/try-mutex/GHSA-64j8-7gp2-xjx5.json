  "summary": "Data races in try-mutex",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait for TryMutex\u003cT\u003e type. This allows users to put non-Send T type in TryMutex and send it to another thread, which can cause a data race. The flaw was corrected in the 0.3.0 release by adding T: Send bound for the Sync trait implementation.",
