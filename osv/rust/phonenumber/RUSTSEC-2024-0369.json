  "summary": "phonenumber:  panic on parsing crafted phonenumber inputs",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a reachable `assert!` guard on the phonenumber string.\n\nIn a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the \"number\" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56.\n\nSince f69abee1/0.3.4/#52.\n\n0.2.x series is not affected.\n\n### Patches\nPatches have been published as version `0.3.6+8.13.36`.",
