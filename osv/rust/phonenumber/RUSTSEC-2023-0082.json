  "summary": "phonenumber:  panic on parsing crafted RF3966 phonenumber inputs",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string.\n\nIn a typical deployment of `rust-phonenumber`, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber over the network, specifically the string `.;phone-context=`.\n\n### Patches\nPatches will be published as version `0.3.3+8.13.9` and backported as `0.2.5+8.11.3`.",
