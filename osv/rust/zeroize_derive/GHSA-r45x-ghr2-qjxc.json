  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory is a duplicate of [GHSA-c5hx-w945-j4pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5hx-w945-j4pq). This link is preserved to maintain external references.\n\n## Original Description\nAffected versions of this crate did not implement `Drop` when `#[zeroize(drop)]` was used on an `enum`.\n\nThis can result in memory not being zeroed out after dropping it, which is exactly what is intended when adding this attribute.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 1.2 and `#[zeroize(drop)]` on `enum`s now properly implements `Drop`.\n",
