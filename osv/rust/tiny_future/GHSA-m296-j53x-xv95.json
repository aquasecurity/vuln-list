  "summary": "Data races in tiny_future",
  "details": "`tiny_future` contains a light-weight implementation of `Future`s. The `Future` type it has lacked bound on its `Send` and `Sync` traits. This allows for a bug where non-thread safe types such as `Cell` can be used in `Future`s and cause data races in concurrent programs. The flaw was corrected in commit `c791919` by adding trait bounds to `Future`'s `Send` and `Sync`.\n",
