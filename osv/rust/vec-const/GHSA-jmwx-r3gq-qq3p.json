  "summary": "vec-const attempts to construct a Vec from a pointer to a const slice",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate claimed to construct a const `Vec` with nonzero length and capacity, but that cannot be done because such a `Vec` requires a pointer from an allocator.\n\nThe implementation was later changed to just construct a `std::borrow::Cow`.\n",
