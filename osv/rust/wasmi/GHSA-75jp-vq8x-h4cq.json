  "summary": "Wasmi Out-of-bounds Write for host to Wasm calls with more than 128 Parameters",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nIn the WASMI Interpreter, an [Out-of-bounds Buffer Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) will arise arise if the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as it will surpass the stack value. This doesnâ€™t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from host to Wasm.\n\n### Impact\n\nAfter conducting an analysis of the dependent Polkadot systems of `wasmi`: [Pallet Contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/contracts), [Parity Signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer), and [Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot), we have found that none on those systems have been affected by the issue as they are calling host to Wasm function with a small limited amount of parameters always. \n\n### Mitigations\n\nIf you are using `wasmi` betwen version 0.15.0 and 0.31.0, please update it to the [0.31.1](https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi/releases/tag/v0.31.1) patch release that we just published.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure no more than 128 parameters can be pass in a call from the host to a Wasm function. \n\n### References\n\nPatch PR: \u003cPR\u003e\n\n### Special thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to Stellar Development Foundation for reporting this security vulnerability.",
