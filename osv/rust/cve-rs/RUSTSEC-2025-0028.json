  "details": "This crate is a joke and should never be used.\n\n`cve-rs` provides demonstrations of common memory vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows and segfaults) implemented completely within safe Rust.\n\nInternally, this crate does not use unsafe code, it instead exploits a soundness bug in rustc: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25860",
