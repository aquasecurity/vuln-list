  "summary": "Flaw in string parsing can lead to crashes due to invalid memory access.",
  "details": "The affected version of this crate did not guard against accessing memory\nbeyond the range of its input data. A pointer cast to read the data into\na 256-bit register could lead to a segmentation fault when the end plus\nthe 32 bytes (256 bit) read would overlap into the next page during string\nparsing.\n\n```\npage   |  ...  page 1  ...  | ... page 2  ... |\ndata   | x[n * 32 byte]xx__ |                 |\naccess | ..][ 32 byte ]     |                 |\nsegflt |               [ 32 | byte ]          |\n```\n\nThis allows an attacker to eventually crash a service.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by using a padding buffer for the last read from the\ninput. So that we are we never read over the boundary of the input data.",
