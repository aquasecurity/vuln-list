  "summary": "Data races in ticketed_lock",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for ReadTicket\u003cT\u003e \u0026 WriteTicket\u003cT\u003e. This allows to send non-Send T to other threads. This can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as T of ReadTicket\u003cT\u003e/WriteTicket\u003cT\u003e). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior. The flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding T: Send bounds to Send impls of ReadTicket\u003cT\u003e/WriteTicket\u003cT\u003e.",
