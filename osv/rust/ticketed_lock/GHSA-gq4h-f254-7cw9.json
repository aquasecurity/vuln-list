  "summary": "Data races in ticketed_lock",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket\u003cT\u003e` \u0026 `WriteTicket\u003cT\u003e`.\nThis allows to send non-Send `T` to other threads.\n\nThis can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket\u003cT\u003e`/`WriteTicket\u003cT\u003e`). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket\u003cT\u003e`/`WriteTicket\u003cT\u003e`.\n",
