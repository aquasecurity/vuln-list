  "summary": "scalarmult() vulnerable to degenerate public keys",
  "details": "The scalarmult() function included in previous versions of this crate accepted all-zero public keys, for which the resulting Diffie-Hellman shared secret will always be zero regardless of the private key used.\n\nThis issue was fixed by checking for this class of keys and rejecting them if they are used.",
