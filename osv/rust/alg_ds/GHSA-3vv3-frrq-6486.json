  "summary": "Use of Uninitialized Resource in alg_ds",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the alg_ds crate through 2020-08-25 for Rust. `Matrix::new()` internally calls `Matrix::fill_with()` which uses `*ptr = value` pattern to initialize the buffer. This pattern assumes that there is an initialized struct at the address and drops it, which results in dropping of uninitialized struct.",
