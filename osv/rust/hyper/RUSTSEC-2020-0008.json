  "summary": "Flaw in hyper allows request smuggling by sending a body in GET requests",
  "details": "Vulnerable versions of hyper allow GET requests to have bodies, even if there is\nno Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header.  As per the HTTP 1.1\nspecification, such requests do not have bodies, so the body will be interpreted\nas a separate HTTP request.\n\nThis allows an attacker who can control the body and method of an HTTP request\nmade by hyper to inject a request with headers that would not otherwise be\nallowed, as demonstrated by sending a malformed HTTP request from a Substrate\nruntime.  This allows bypassing CORS restrictions.  In combination with other\nvulnerabilities, such as an exploitable web server listening on loopback, it may\nallow remote code execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in hyper version 0.12.34.",
