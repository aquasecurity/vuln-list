  "details": "Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` in the HTTP1 parser to create values of type `httparse::Header` (from the `httparse` crate).\nThis is unsound, since `Header` contains references and thus must be non-null.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using `MaybeUninit` instead.\n",
