  "summary": "hyper and h2 vulnerable to denial of service",
  "details": "Hyper is an HTTP library for Rust and h2 is an HTTP 2.0 client \u0026 server implementation for Rust. An issue was discovered in hyper v0.13.7 and h2 v0.2.4 when proessing header frames. Both packages incorrectly process the HTTP2 `RST_STREAM` frames by not always releasing the memory immediately upon receiving the reset frame, leading to stream stacking. As a result, the memory and CPU usage are high which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nAs of time of publication of this advisory, there is no evidence of a fix having been incorporated into hyper or h2.",
