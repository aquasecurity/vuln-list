  "summary": "Parsing borsh messages with ZST which are not-copy/clone is unsound",
  "details": "Affected versions of borsh cause undefined behavior when zero-sized-types (ZST) are parsed and the Copy/Clone traits are not implemented/derived. For instance if 1000 instances of a ZST are deserialized, and the ZST is not copy (this can be achieved through a singleton), then accessing/writing to deserialized data will cause a segmentation fault.\n\nThere is currently no way for borsh to read data without also providing a Rust type. Therefore, if you are not using ZST for serialization, then you are not affected by this issue. \n",
