  "summary": "`XmpFile::close` can trigger UB",
  "details": "Affected versions of the crate failed to catch C++ exceptions raised within the `XmpFile::close` function. If such an exception occured, it would trigger undefined behavior, typically a process abort.\n\nThis is best demonstrated in [issue #230](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-toolkit-rs/issues/230), where a race condition causes the `close` call to fail due to file I/O errors.\n\nThis was fixed in [PR #232](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-toolkit-rs/pull/232) (released as crate version 1.9.0), which now safely handles the exception.\n\nFor backward compatibility, the existing API ignores the error. A new API `XmpFile::try_close` was added to allow callers to receive and process the error result.\n\nUsers of all prior versions of `xmp_toolkit` are encouraged to update to version 1.9.0 to avoid undefined behavior.",
