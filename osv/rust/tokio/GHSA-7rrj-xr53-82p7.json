  "summary": "Tokio reject_remote_clients configuration may get dropped when creating a Windows named pipe",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. This also applies if `reject_remote_clients` is not explicitly set as this is the default configuration and is cleared by calling `pipe_mode`.\n\nRemote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publically shared folder (SMB).\n\n### Patches\n\nThe following versions have been patched:\n* 1.23.1\n* 1.20.3\n* 1.18.4\n\nThe fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0.\n\nNamed pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that `pipe_mode` is set **first** after initializing a `ServerOptions`. For example:\n\n```rust\nlet mut opts = ServerOptions::new();\nopts.pipe_mode(PipeMode::Message);\nopts.reject_remote_clients(true);\n```\n\n### References\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createnamedpipea#pipe_reject_remote_clients\n",
