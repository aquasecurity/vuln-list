  "summary": "cggmp21 has a missing check in the ZK proof used in CGGMP21",
  "details": "### Impact\ncggmp21  concerns a missing check in the ZK proof that enables an attack in which a single malicious signer can reconstruct full private key.\n\n### Patches\n* `cggmp21 v0.6.3` is a patch release that contains a fix that introduces this specific missing check\n* However, cggmp21 recommends upgrading to `cggmp24 v0.7.0-alpha.2` which contains many other security checks as a precaution. Follow [migration guideline](https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/cggmp21/blob/v0.7.0-alpha.2/CGGMP21_MIGRATION.md) to upgrade.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdate to `cggmp21 v0.6.3`, a minor release that contains a minimal security patch.\n\nHowever, for full mitigation, users will need to upgrade to `cggmp24 v0.7.0-alpha.2` as it contains many more security check implementations.\n\n### Resources\nRead this [blog post](https://www.dfns.co/article/cggmp21-vulnerabilities-patched-and-explained) to learn more.",
