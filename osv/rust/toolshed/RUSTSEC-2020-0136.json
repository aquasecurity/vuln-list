  "summary": "CopyCell lacks bounds on its Send trait allowing for data races",
  "details": "`CopyCell\u003cT\u003e` is a `Cell`-like type that is implemented for any type `T` that\nis `Copy`able. It's `Send` trait has no bounds on the contained type.\n\nAs not all `Copy`able types are thread safe, for example non-mutable references\nimplement the `Copy` trait, it is possible to send references to types with\ninterior mutability such as `Cell` across threads and cause data races.",
