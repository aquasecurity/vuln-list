  "summary": "Tauri's readDir Endpoint Scope can be Bypassed With Symbolic Links",
  "details": "### Impact\nDue to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked.\n\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been resolved in https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123 and the implementation now properly checks if the\nrequested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`.\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.\n\n### For more information\n\nThis issue was initially reported by [martin-ocasek]( https://github.com/martin-ocasek) in [#4882](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4882).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)\n* Email us at [security@tauri.app](mailto:security@tauri.app)\n",
