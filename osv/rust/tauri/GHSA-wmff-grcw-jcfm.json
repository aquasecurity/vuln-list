  "summary": "Tauri vulnerable to Regression on Filesystem Scope Checks for Dotfiles",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Linux and macOS.\n\nPreviously dotfiles (eg. `$HOME/.ssh/`) were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented and dotfiles were implicitly allowed.\n\nOnly Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected.\nOnly macOS and Linux systems are affected.\n\n### Patches\nThe regression has been patched on `v1.4.1`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds at this time, users should update to `v1.4.1` immediately.\n\n### References\nSee the [original advisory](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5) for more information.\n\n### For more Information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in tauri\nEmail us at [security@tauri.app](mailto:security@tauri.app)",
