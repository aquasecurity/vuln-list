  "summary": "Out of bounds write in serde_cbor",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic tags were nested excessively during deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft small (\u003c 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow. The flaw was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.",
