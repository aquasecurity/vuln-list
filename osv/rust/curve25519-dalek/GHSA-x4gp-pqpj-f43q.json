  "summary": "curve25519-dalek has timing variability in `curve25519-dalek`'s `Scalar29::sub`/`Scalar52::sub`",
  "details": "Timing variability of any kind is problematic when working with  potentially secret values such as elliptic curve scalars, and such issues can potentially leak private keys and other secrets. Such a problem was recently discovered in `curve25519-dalek`.\n\nThe `Scalar29::sub` (32-bit) and `Scalar52::sub` (64-bit) functions contained usage of a mask value inside a loop where LLVM saw an opportunity to insert a branch instruction (`jns` on x86) to conditionally bypass this code section when the mask value is set to zero as can be seen in godbolt:\n\n- 32-bit (see L106): https://godbolt.org/z/zvaWxzvqv\n- 64-bit (see L48): https://godbolt.org/z/PczYj7Pda\n\nA similar problem was recently discovered in the Kyber reference implementation:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/hqbtIGFKIpU/m/cnE3pbueBgAJ\n\nAs discussed on that thread, one portable solution, which is also used in this PR, is to introduce a volatile read as an optimization barrier, which prevents the compiler from optimizing it away.\n\nThe fix can be validated in godbolt here:\n\n- 32-bit: https://godbolt.org/z/jc9j7eb8E\n- 64-bit: https://godbolt.org/z/x8d46Yfah\n\nThe problem was discovered and the solution independently verified by Alexander Wagner \u003calexander.wagner@aisec.fraunhofer.de\u003e and Lea Themint \u003clea.thiemt@tum.de\u003e using their DATA tool:\n\nhttps://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/DATA",
