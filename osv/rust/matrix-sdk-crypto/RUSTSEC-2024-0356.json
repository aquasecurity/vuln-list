  "summary": "`UserIdentity::is_verified` not checking verification status of own user identity while performing the check",
  "details": "The `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before\nversion 0.7.2 doesn't take into account the verification status of the user's\nown identity while performing the check and may as a result return a value\ncontrary to what is implied by its name and documentation.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards\na user identity, a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to\nmake the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method,\nwhich lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the\nmatrix-sdk-crypto crate.",
