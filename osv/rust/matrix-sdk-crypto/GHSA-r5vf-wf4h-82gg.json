  "summary": "matrix-sdk-crypto missing facility to signal rotation of a verified cryptographic identity",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nVersions of the matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate before 0.8.0 lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a user's cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one, which could cause client applications relying on the SDK to overlook such changes.\n\n### Patches\n\nmatrix-sdk-crypto 0.8.0 adds a new `VerificationLevel::VerificationViolation` enum variant which indicates that a previously verified identity has been changed.\n\n### References\n\n- Patch: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3795\n",
