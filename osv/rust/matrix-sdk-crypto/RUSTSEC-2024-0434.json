  "summary": " Missing facility to signal rotation of a verified cryptographic identity",
  "details": "Versions of the matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate before 0.8.0 lack a dedicated\nmechanism to notify that a user's cryptographic identity has changed from a\nverified to an unverified one, which could cause client applications relying on\nthe SDK to overlook such changes.\n\nmatrix-sdk-crypto 0.8.0 adds a new `VerificationLevel::VerificationViolation`\nenum variant which indicates that a previously verified identity has been\nchanged.",
