  "summary": "Openh264 Decoding Functions Heap Overflow Vulnerability",
  "details": "OpenH264 recently reported a [heap overflow](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/security/advisories/GHSA-m99q-5j7x-7m9x) that was fixed in upstream [63db555](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/commit/63db555e30986e3a5f07871368dc90ae78c27449) and [integrated into](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/openh264-rs/commit/3a822fff0b4c9a984622ca2b179fe8898ac54b14) our 0.6.6 release. For users relying on Cisco's pre-compiled DLL, we also published 0.8.0, which is compatible with their latest fixed DLL version  2.6.0. \n\nIn other words:\n- if you rely on our `source` feature only, \u003e=0.6.6 should be safe,\n- if you rely on `libloading`, you must upgrade to 0.8.0 _and_ use their latest DLL \u003e=2.6.0. \n\nUsers handling untrusted video files should update immediately.",
