  "summary": "libsecp256k1 contains side-channel timing attack",
  "details": "Versions of libsecp256k1 prior to 0.3.1 did not execute `Scalar::check_overflow` in constant time. This allows an attacker to potentially leak information via a timing attack. The flaw was corrected by modifying `Scalar::check_overflow` to execute in constant time.",
