  "summary": "Data races in gfwx",
  "details": "In the affected versions of this crate, ImageChunkMut\u003c'_, T\u003e unconditionally implements Send and Sync, allowing to create data races.\n\nThis can result in a memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5 by adding T: Send bound to the Send impl and adding T: Sync bound to the Sync impl.",
