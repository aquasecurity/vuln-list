  "details": "The following functions in the `tanton_engine` crate are unsound due to lack of sufficient boundary\nchecks in public API:\n\n- `Stack::offset()`\n- `ThreadStack::get()`\n- `RootMoveList::insert_score_depth()`\n- `RootMoveList::insert_score()`\n\nThe tanton_engine crate is no longer maintained, so there are no plans to fix this issue.",
