  "summary": "Uncontrolled Recursion in rulex",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately.\n\nThis is a security concern for you, if\n- your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and\n- your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow.\n\n### Patches\nThe crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [rulex](https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/issues)\n* Email me at [ludwig.stecher@gmx.de](mailto:ludwig.stecher@gmx.de)\n\n### Credits\n\nCredit for finding these bugs goes to\n\n- [evanrichter](https://github.com/evanrichter)\n- [ForAllSecure Mayhem](https://forallsecure.com/)\n- [cargo fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) and [afl.rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs)",
