  "summary": "buffered-reader vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access leading to panic",
  "details": "Affected versions of the crate have a bug where attacker-controlled input can result in the use of an out-of-bound array index. Rust\ndetects the use of the out-of-bound index and causes the application to panic.  An attacker may be able to use this to cause a denial-of-service.  However, it is not possible for an attacker to read from or write to the application's address space.",
