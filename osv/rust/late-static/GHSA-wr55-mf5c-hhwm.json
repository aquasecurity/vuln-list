  "summary": "Data races in late-static",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate implemented Sync for LateStatic with T: Send, so that it is possible to create a data race to a type T: Send + !Sync (e.g. Cell\u003cT\u003e).\n\nThis can result in a memory corruption or other kinds of undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 11f396c by replacing the T: Send bound to T: Sync bound in the Sync impl for LateStatic\u003cT\u003e.",
