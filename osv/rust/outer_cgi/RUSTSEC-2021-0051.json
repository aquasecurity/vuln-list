  "summary": "KeyValueReader passes uninitialized memory to Read instance",
  "details": "The `KeyValueReader` type in affected versions of this crate set up an\nuninitialized memory buffer and passed them to be read in to a user-provided\n`Read` instance.\n\nThe `Read` instance could read uninitialized memory and cause undefined\nbehavior and miscompilations.\n\nThis issue was fixed in commit [dd59b30](https://github.com/SolraBizna/outer_cgi/commit/dd59b3066e616a08e756f72de8dc3ab11b7036c4)\nby zero-initializing the buffers before passing them.",
