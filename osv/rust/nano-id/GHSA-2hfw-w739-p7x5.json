  "summary": "nano-id reduced entropy due to inadequate character set usage",
  "details": "## Description\n\nAffected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified.\n\nIt should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe flaws were corrected in commit [a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23](https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23) by updating the the `nano_id::gen` macro to use all specified characters correctly.\n\n## PoC\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::BTreeSet;\n\nfn main() {\n    test_base58();\n    test_base62();\n}\n\nfn test_base58() {\n    let mut produced_symbols = BTreeSet::new();\n\n    for _ in 0..100_000 {\nid = \"RUSTSEC-2024-0343\"\n        for c in id.chars() {\n            produced_symbols.insert(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    println!(\n        \"{} symbols generated from nano_id::base58\",\n        produced_symbols.len()\n    );\n}\n\nfn test_base62() {\n    let mut produced_symbols = BTreeSet::new();\n\n    for _ in 0..100_000 {\nid = \"RUSTSEC-2024-0343\"\n        for c in id.chars() {\n            produced_symbols.insert(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    println!(\n        \"{} symbols generated from nano_id::base62\",\n        produced_symbols.len()\n    );\n}\n```\n",
