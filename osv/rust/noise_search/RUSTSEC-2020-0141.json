  "summary": "MvccRwLock allows data races \u0026 aliasing violations",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `MvccRwLock`.\nThis can lead to data races when types that are either `!Send` or `!Sync` (e.g. `Rc\u003cT\u003e`, `Arc\u003cCell\u003c_\u003e\u003e`) are contained inside `MvccRwLock` and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).\n\nAlso, safe APIs of `MvccRwLock` allow aliasing violations by allowing `\u0026T` and `LockResult\u003cMutexGuard\u003cBox\u003cT\u003e\u003e\u003e` to co-exist in conflicting lifetime regions. The APIs of `MvccRwLock` should either be marked as `unsafe` or `MbccRwLock` should be changed to private or pub(crate).",
