This can be triggered via causing the accept call to error out with errors there were not covered correctly causing the accept loop to exit. \n\nMore information can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/1897)\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrading to tonic `0.12.3` and above contains the fix. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nA custom accept loop is a possible workaround.",
