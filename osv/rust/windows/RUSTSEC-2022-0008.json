  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not require event handlers to have `Send` bound despite there being no guarantee of them being called on any particular thread, which can potentially lead to data races and undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit [afe3252](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/commit/afe32525c22209aa8f632a0f4ad607863b51796a) by adding `Send` bounds.",
