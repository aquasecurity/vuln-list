  "summary": "Data races in model",
  "details": "`Shared` data structure in `model` crate implements `Send` and `Sync` traits regardless of the inner type.\nThis allows safe Rust code to trigger a data race, which is undefined behavior in Rust.\n\nUsers are advised to treat `Shared` as an unsafe type.\nIt should not be used outside of the testing context,\nand care must be taken so that the testing code does not have a data race\nbesides a race condition that is expected to be caught by the test.\n\nCheck [the Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html) for the difference between\na data race and a general race condition.\n",
