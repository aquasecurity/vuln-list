  "summary": "Ursa CL-Signatures Revocation allows verifiers to generate unique identifiers for holders",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a malicious verifier may be able to generate a unique identifier for a holder providing a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof.\n\n### Details\n\nThe revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, potentially allowing a malicious verifier to generate a unique identifier for a holder that provides a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof.\n\nThe flaws affects all CL-Signature versions published from the [Hyperledger Ursa] repository to the [Ursa Rust Crate], and is fixed in all versions published from the [Hyperledger AnonCreds CL-Signatures] repository to the [AnonCreds CL-Signatures Rust Crate].\n\nThe addressing the flaw requires updating AnonCreds holder software (such as mobile wallets) to a corrected CL-Signature implementation, such as the [AnonCreds CL Signatures Rust Crate]. Verifying presentations from corrected holders requires a updating the verifier software to a corrected CL-Signatures implementation. An updated verifier based on AnonCreds CL-Signatures can verify presentations from holders built on either the flawed Ursa CL-Signature implementation or a corrected CL-Signature implementation\n\n[Hyperledger Ursa]: https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa\n[Ursa Rust Crate]: https://crates.io/crates/ursa\n[Hyperledger AnonCreds CL-Signatures]: https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-clsignatures-rs\n[AnonCreds CL-Signatures Rust Crate]: https://crates.io/crates/anoncreds-clsignatures\n\nThe flaw occurs as a result of generating a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof from a flawed implementation.\n\n### Impact\nThe impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a Non-Revocation proof.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade libraries/holder applications that generate AnonCreds verifiable presentations using the [Ursa Rust Crate] to any version of the [AnonCreds CL-Signatures Rust Crate].",
