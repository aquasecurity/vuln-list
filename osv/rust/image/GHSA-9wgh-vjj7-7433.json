  "summary": "Mutable reference with immutable provenance in image",
  "details": "A mutable reference to a struct was constructed by dereferencing a pointer obtained from slice::as_ptr. Instead, slice::as_mut_ptr should have been called on the mutable slice argument. The former performs an implicit reborrow as an immutable shared reference which does not allow writing through the derived pointer.",
