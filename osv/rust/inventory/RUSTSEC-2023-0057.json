  "summary": "Fails to prohibit standard library access prior to initialization of Rust standard library runtime",
  "details": "Affected versions allow arbitrary caller-provided code to execute before the\nlifetime of `main`.\n\nIf the caller-provided code accesses particular pieces of the standard library\nthat require an initialized Rust runtime, such as `std::io` or `std::thread`,\nthese may not behave as documented. Panics are likely; UB is possible.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by enforcing that only code written within the\n`inventory` crate, which is guaranteed not to access runtime-dependent parts of\nthe standard library, runs before `main`. Caller-provided code is restricted to\nrunning at compile time.",
