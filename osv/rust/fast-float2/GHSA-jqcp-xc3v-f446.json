  "summary": "fast-float2 has a segmentation fault due to lack of bound check",
  "details": "In this case, the \"fast_float2::common::AsciiStr::first\" method within the \"AsciiStr\" struct \nuses the unsafe keyword to reading from memory without performing bounds checking. \nSpecifically, it directly dereferences a pointer offset by \"self.ptr\".\nBecause of the above reason, the method accesses invalid memory address when it takes an empty string as its input.\nThis approach violates Rustâ€™s memory safety guarantees, as it can lead to invalid memory access if empty buffer is provided.\n",
