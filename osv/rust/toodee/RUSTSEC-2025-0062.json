  "summary": "Heap Buffer Overflow in the DrainCol Destructor",
  "details": "An off-by-one error in the `DrainCol::drop` destructor could cause an unsafe memory copy\noperation to exceed the bounds of the associated vector.\n\nThe error was related to the size of the data being copied in one of the `ptr::copy`\ninvocations inside the destructor.\n\nWhen removing the first column from a TooDee object, the DrainCol return object could cause\na heap buffer overflow vulnerability when it is dropped.\n\nThe issue was fixed in commit `e6e16d5` by reducing the copied size by one.",
