  "summary": "`MaybeUninit` misuse in `simd-json-derive`",
  "details": "An invalid use of `MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()` in `simd-json-derive`'s derive macro can cause undefined behavior. The original code used `MaybeUninit` to avoid initialisation of the struct and then set the fields using `ptr::write`. The undefined behavior triggered by this misuse of `MaybeUninit` can lead to invlaid memory access and panics in binaries compiled in release mode (aka simd-json-derive prior to version 0.12 has UB and optimizes into some nonsense)\n\nThe `0.12.0` removes this section of code, avoiding the use of MaybeUninit alltogether.",
