  "summary": "Possible use-after-free with `proplist::Iterator`",
  "details": "Affected versions contained a possible use-after-free issue with property list iteration\ndue to a lack of a lifetime constraint tying the lifetime of a `proplist::Iterator` to the\n`Proplist` object for which it was created. This made it possible for users, without\nexperiencing a compiler error/warning, to destroy the `Proplist` object before the iterator,\nthus destroying the underlying C object the iterator works upon, before the iterator may be\nfinished with it.\n\nThis impacts all versions of the crate before `2.5.0` back to `1.0.5`. Before version\n`1.0.5` the function that produces the iterator was broken to the point of being useless.",
