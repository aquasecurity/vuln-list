  "summary": "gix-transport code execution vulnerability",
  "details": "The `gix-transport` crate prior to the patched version 0.36.1 would allow attackers to use malicious ssh clone URLs to pass arbitrary arguments to the `ssh` program, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nPoC: `gix clone 'ssh://-oProxyCommand=open$IFS-aCalculator/foo'`\n\nThis will launch a calculator on OSX.\n\nSee https://secure.phabricator.com/T12961 for more details on similar vulnerabilities in `git`.\n\nThanks for [vin01](https://github.com/vin01) for disclosing this issue.",
