  "summary": "bottlerocket dependency openssl is vulnerable to read buffer overflow via X.509 verification",
  "details": "A read buffer overflow can be triggered in OpenSSL X.509 verification during name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after the certificate chain has been verified and would require a compromised CA. This can cause a client or agent compiled with OpenSSL to crash unexpectedly. OpenSSL has been removed in bottlerocket/update-operator version 1.1.0 in favor of Rust-based TLS using rustls.",
