  "summary": "bottlerocket dependency openssl provides streaming of ASN.1 data via a BIO",
  "details": "An OpenSSL public API provides streaming of ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is possible for a malicious third party to use the BIO to access unfreed memory pointers that are not cleaned up after execution of the API. Freeing these memory pointers will result in a crash. Agents and clients compiled with OpenSSL may see unexpected crashes. OpenSSL has been removed in bottlerocket/update-operator version 1.1.0 in favor of Rust-based TLS using rustls.",
