  "summary": "bottlerocket dependency openssl has a double free vulnerability",
  "details": "A double-free vulnerability exists in OpenSSL where it is possible to construct a malicious PEM file that has 0 bytes of payload data. This then points to data that has already been freed in memory which, when freed again, leads to a crash. Agents or clients compiled with OpenSSL may crash unexpectedly when parsing these PEM files. OpenSSL has been removed in bottlerocket/update-operator version 1.1.0 in favor of Rust-based TLS using rustls.",
