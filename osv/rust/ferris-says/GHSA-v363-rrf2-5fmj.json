  "summary": "ferris-says has undefined behavior when not using UTF-8",
  "details": "Affected versions receive a `\u0026[u8]` from the caller through a safe API, and pass it directly to the unsafe `str::from_utf8_unchecked` function.\n\nThe behavior of `ferris_says::say` is undefined if the bytes from the caller don't happen to be valid UTF-8.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in [ferris-says#21] by using the safe `str::from_utf8` instead, and returning an error on invalid input. However this fix has not yet been published to crates.io as a patch version for 0.2.\n\nSeparately, [ferris-says#32] has introduced a different API for version 0.3 which accepts input as `\u0026str` rather than `\u0026[u8]`, so is unaffected by this bug.\n\n[ferris-says#21]: https://github.com/rust-lang/ferris-says/pull/21\n[ferris-says#32]: https://github.com/rust-lang/ferris-says/pull/32",
