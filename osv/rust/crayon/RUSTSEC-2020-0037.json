  "summary": "Misbehaving `HandleLike` implementation can lead to memory safety violation",
  "details": "Unsafe code in `ObjectPool` has time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug that\ncan eventually lead to a memory safety violation. `ObjectPool` and `HandlePool`\nimplicitly assumes that `HandleLike` trait methods are pure, i.e., they always\nreturn the same value. However, this assumption is unsound since `HandleLike`\nis a safe, public trait that allows a custom implementation.",
