  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly calculate secret shares requirements.\n\nThis reduces the security of the algorithm by restricting the crate to always\nusing a threshold value of three, rather than a configurable limit.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by correctly configuring the threshold.\n",
