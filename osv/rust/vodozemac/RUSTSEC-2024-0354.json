  "summary": " Usage of non-constant time base64 decoder could lead to leakage of secret key material",
  "details": "Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation\nfor importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519\nsecret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about\nthe secret key material through a side-channel attack.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to\nobserve timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret\nkey material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret\nkey material.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the\nattacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as\nwell as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.\nAdditionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the\nreferenced paper[[1]].\n\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04600",
