  "summary": "Uncontrolled recursion in trust-dns-proto",
  "details": "There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses a malicious DNS packet. Affected versions of this crate did not properly handle parsing of DNS message compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be tricked into infinite loop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain name to be parsed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which when consumed with Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software.",
