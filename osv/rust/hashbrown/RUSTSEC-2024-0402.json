  "details": "The borsh serialization of the HashMap did not follow the borsh specification.\nIt potentially produced non-canonical encodings dependent on insertion order.\nIt also did not perform canonicty checks on decoding.\n\nThis can result in consensus splits and cause equivalent objects to be\nconsidered distinct.\n\nThis was patched in 0.15.1.",
