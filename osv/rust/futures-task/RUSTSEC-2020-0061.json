  "summary": "futures_task::noop_waker_ref can segfault due to dereferencing a NULL pointer",
  "details": "Affected versions of the crate used a `UnsafeCell` in thread-local storage to return a noop waker reference,\nassuming that the reference would never be returned from another thread.\n\nThis resulted in a segmentation fault crash if `Waker::wake_by_ref()` was called on a waker returned from another thread due to \nit attempting to dereference a pointer that wasn't accessible from the main thread.\n\nReproduction Example (from issue):\n```rust\nuse futures_task::noop_waker_ref;\nfn main() {\n    let waker = std::thread::spawn(|| noop_waker_ref()).join().unwrap();\n    waker.wake_by_ref();\n}\n```\n\nThe flaw was corrected by using a `OnceCell::Lazy\u003c\u003e` wrapper around the noop waker instead of thread-local storage.",
