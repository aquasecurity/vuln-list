  "summary": "users may append `root` to group listings",
  "details": "Affected versions append `root` to group listings, unless the correct listing has exactly 1024 groups.\n\nThis affects both:\n\n- The supplementary groups of a user\n- The group access list of the current process\n\nIf the caller uses this information for access control, this may lead to privilege escalation.\n\nThis crate is not currently maintained, so a patched version is not available.\n\nVersions older than 0.8.0 do not contain the affected functions, so downgrading to them is a workaround.\n\n## Recommended alternatives\n- [`uzers`](https://crates.io/crates/uzers) (an actively maintained fork of the `users` crate)\n- [`sysinfo`](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)",
