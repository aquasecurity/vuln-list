  "summary": "deno_doc's HTML generator vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nSeveral cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the `deno_doc` crate which lead to Self-XSS with `deno doc --html`.\n\n### Details \u0026 PoC\n\n1.) XSS in generated `search_index.js`\n\n`deno_doc` outputed a JavaScript file for searching. However, the generated file used `innerHTML` on unsanitzed HTML input.\n\nhttps://github.com/denoland/deno_doc/blob/dc556c848831d7ae48f3eff2ababc6e75eb6b73e/src/html/templates/pages/search.js#L120-L144\n\n2.) XSS via property, method and enum names\n\n`deno_doc` did not sanitize property names, method names and enum names.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since `deno doc --html` is expected to be used locally with own packages.",
