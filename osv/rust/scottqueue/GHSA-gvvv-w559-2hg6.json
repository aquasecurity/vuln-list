  "summary": "Data races in scottqueue",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the scottqueue crate through 2020-11-15 for Rust. There are unconditional implementations of Send and Sync for Queue\u003cT\u003e. This allows (1) creating data races to a `T: !Sync` and (2) sending `T: !Send` to other threads, resulting in memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n",
