  "summary": "Insufficient covariance check makes self_cell unsound",
  "details": "All public versions prior to `1.02` used an insufficient check to ensure that users correctly marked the dependent type as either `covariant` or `not_covariant`. This allowed users to mark a dependent as covariant even though its type was not covariant but invariant, for certain invariant types involving trait object lifetimes. One example for such a dependent type is `type Dependent\u003c'a\u003e = RefCell\u003cBox\u003cdyn fmt::Display + 'a\u003e\u003e`. Such a type allowed unsound usage in purely safe user code that leads to undefined behavior. The patched versions now produce a compile time error if such a type is marked as `covariant`.",
