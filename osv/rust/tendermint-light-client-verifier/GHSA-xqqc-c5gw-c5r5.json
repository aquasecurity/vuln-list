  "summary": "Tendermint light client verification not taking into account chain ID",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAnyone using the `tendermint-light-client` and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes).\n\nAt present, the light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client.\n\nThe attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers of the light client-related crates can currently upgrade to `v0.28.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\n- [Light Client specification](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/main/spec/light-client)",
