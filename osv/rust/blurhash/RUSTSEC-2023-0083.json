  "summary": "blurhash: panic on parsing crafted blurhash inputs",
  "details": "## Impact\nThe blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input.\n\nIn a typical deployment, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network. These may include:\n- UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters\n\n## Patches\nThe patches were released under version 0.2.0, which may require user intervention because of slight API churn.",
