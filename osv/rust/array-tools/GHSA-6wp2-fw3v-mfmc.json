  "summary": "Memory corruption in array-tools",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the array-tools crate before 0.3.2 for Rust. Affected versions of this crate don't guard against panics, so that partially uninitialized buffer is dropped when user-provided `T::clone()` panics in `FixedCapacityDequeLike\u003cT, A\u003e::clone()`. This causes memory corruption.\n",
