  "summary": "Integer underflow in Frontier",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. It is recommended that you apply the patch as soon as possible.\n\nIf you do not use MODEXP precompile in your runtime, then you are not impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatches are applied in PR #549.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone.\n\n### References\n\nPatch PR: #549\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to SR-Labs for discovering the security vulnerability, and thanks to PureStake team for the patches.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [Frontier repo](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier)\n",
