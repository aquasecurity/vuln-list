  ],
  "summary": "Validity check missing in Frontier",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIn the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block.\n\nThe attack is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in commit 146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba.\n\n### References\n\nPatch PR: https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/495\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Frontier repo](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/issues)\n\n### Special thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to @librelois, @nanocryk and the Moonbeam team for reporting and fixing this security vulnerability.",
