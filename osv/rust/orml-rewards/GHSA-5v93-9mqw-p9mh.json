  "summary": "Uncaught Panic in ORML Rewards Pallet",
  "details": "## Summary\nA vulnerability in the `add_share` function of the **Rewards** pallet (part of the ORML repository) can lead to an uncaught Rust panic when handling user-provided input exceeding the `u128` range.\n\n## Affected Components\n- **ORML Rewards** pallet (`rewards/src/lib.rs`)\n- Any Substrate-based chain using ORML Rewards with `add_share` accepting unvalidated large `u128` inputs\n\n## Technical Details\n- `add_share` performs arithmetic on user-supplied values (`add_amount`) of type `T::Share` (mapped to `u128` in Acala).\n- If `add_amount` is large enough (e.g., `i128::MAX`), the intermediate result may overflow and panic on the cast to `u128`.\n- Validation occurs only after arithmetic, enabling a crafted input to trigger an overflow.\n\n## Impact\nA malicious user submitting a specially crafted extrinsic can cause a panic in the runtime:\n- **Denial of Service** by crashing the node process.\n- **Potential for invalid blocks** produced by validators.\n\n## Likelihood\nThis issue is exploitable in production if there exists at least one rewards pool where reward tokens exceed twice the collateral tokens, allowing sufficiently large multiplication to exceed `u128` bounds.\n\n## Remediation\n- This issue is fixed in https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/pull/1016\n\n## Backport\n\nThe patch have been backported to following release branches:\n- polkadot-stable2407\n- polkadot-stable2409\n\nA 1.0.1 patch release is made with this fix.",
