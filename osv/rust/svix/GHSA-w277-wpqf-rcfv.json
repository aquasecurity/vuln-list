  "summary": "Svix vulnerable to improper comparison of different-length signatures",
  "details": "The `Webhook::verify` function incorrectly compared signatures of different lengths - the two signatures would only be compared up to the length of the shorter signature. This allowed an attacker to pass in `v1,` as the signature, which would always pass verification.\n",
