  "summary": "Data races in multiqueue2",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for types used in queue implementations (InnerSend\u003cRW, T\u003e, InnerRecv\u003cRW, T\u003e, FutInnerSend\u003cRW, T\u003e, FutInnerRecv\u003cRW, T\u003e).\n\nThis allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in v0.1.7 by adding T: Send bound to to the Send impl of four data types explained above.",
