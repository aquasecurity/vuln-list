  "summary": "Use after free in nano_arena",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate assumed that Borrow\u003cIdx\u003e was guaranteed to return the same value on .borrow(). The borrowed index value was used to retrieve a mutable reference to a value.\n\nIf the Borrow\u003cIdx\u003e implementation returned a different index, the split arena would allow retrieving the index as a mutable reference creating two mutable references to the same element. This violates Rust's aliasing rules and allows for memory safety issues such as writing out of bounds and use-after-frees.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `6b83f9d` by storing the .borrow() value in a temporary variable.",
