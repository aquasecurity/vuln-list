  "summary": "Race Condition Enabling Link Following and Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in remove_dir_all",
  "details": "The `remove_dir_all` crate is a Rust library that offers additional features over the Rust standard library `fs::remove_dir_all` function. It suffers the same class of failure as the code it was layering over: TOCTOU race conditions, with the ability to cause arbitrary paths to be deleted by substituting a symlink for a path after the type of the path was checked.\n\nThanks to the Rust security team for identifying the problem and alerting us to it.",
