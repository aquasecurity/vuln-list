  "summary": "rPGP Panics on Malformed Untrusted Input",
  "details": "During a security audit, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) discovered several reachable edge cases which allow an attacker to trigger `rpgp` crashes by providing crafted data.\n\n### Impact\nWhen processing malformed input, `rpgp` can run into Rust panics which halt the program.\n\nThis can happen in the following scenarios:\n* Parsing OpenPGP messages from binary or armor format\n* Decrypting OpenPGP messages via `decrypt_with_password()`\n* Parsing or converting public keys\n* Parsing signed cleartext messages from armor format\n* Using malformed private keys to sign or encrypt\n\nGiven the affected components, we consider most attack vectors to be reachable by remote attackers during typical use cases of the `rpgp` library. The attack complexity is low since the malformed messages are generic, short, and require no victim-specific knowledge.\n\nThe result is a denial-of-service impact via program termination. There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.\n\n### Versions and Patches\nAll recent versions are affected by at least some of the above mentioned issues. \n\nThe vulnerabilities have been fixed with version `0.14.1`. We recommend all users to upgrade to this version.\n\n### References\n\n\nThe security audit was made possible by the [NLnet Foundation NGI Zero Core](https://nlnet.nl/core/) grant program [for rpgp](https://nlnet.nl/project/rPGP-cryptorefresh/).\n",
