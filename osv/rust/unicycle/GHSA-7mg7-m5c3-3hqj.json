  "summary": "Data races in unicycle",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` \u0026 `Sync` for types `PinSlab\u003cT\u003e` \u0026 `Unordered\u003cT, S\u003e`. This allows sending non-Send types to other threads and concurrently accessing non-Sync types from multiple threads.\n\nThis can result in a data race \u0026 memory corruption when types that provide internal mutability without synchronization are contained within `PinSlab\u003cT\u003e` or `Unordered\u003cT, S\u003e` and accessed concurrently from multiple threads.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commits 92f40b4 \u0026 6a6c367 by adding trait bound `T: Send` to `Send` impls for `PinSlab\u003cT\u003e` \u0026 `Unordered\u003cT, S\u003e` and adding `T: Sync` to `Sync` impls for `PinSlab\u003cT\u003e` \u0026 `Unordered\u003cT, S\u003e`.\n",
