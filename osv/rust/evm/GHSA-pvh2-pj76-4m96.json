    "CVE-2021-41153"
  ],
  "summary": "Specification non-compliance in JUMPI",
  "details": "### Impact \n\nIn `evm` crate `\u003c 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However, according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the destination validity check.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is a **high** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum mainnet. In this case, you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after `0.31.0`.\n\nThis is a **low** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate in Frontier or in a standalone blockchain, because there's no security exploit possible with this advisory. It is **not** recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal chain upgrade preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain, please ensure to update your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains, please make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are dependent on an older version of `evm` and cannot update due to API interface changes, please contact Wei by email (wei@that.world), who will be happy to help you to publish patch releases for older `evm` versions.\n\n### References\n\nFix PR: https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/67\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the `evm` repo.\n\n### Special thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to @rakita for reporting this issue.\n",
