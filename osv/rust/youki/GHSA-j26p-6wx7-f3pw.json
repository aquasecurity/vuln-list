  "summary": "Youki: If /proc and /sys in the rootfs are symbolic links, they can potentially be exploited to gain access to the host root filesystem.",
  "details": "### Summary\nIf `/proc` and `/sys` in the rootfs are symbolic links, they can potentially be exploited to gain access to the host root filesystem.\n\n### Details\n\nFor security reasons, container creation should be prohibited if `/proc` or `/sys` in the rootfs is a symbolic link.\nI verified this behavior with `youki`.\nWhen `/proc` or `/sys` is a symbolic link, `runc` fails to create the container, whereas `youki` successfully creates it.\n\nThis is the fix related to this issue in `runc`.\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3756\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3773\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go#L590\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/tests/integration/mask.bats#L60\n\n\n### Impact\n\nThe following advisory appears to be related to this vulnerability:\n* https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpvm-3wq2-2wvm\n* https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fh74-hm69-rqjw",
