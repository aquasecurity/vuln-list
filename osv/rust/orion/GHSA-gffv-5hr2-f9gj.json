  "summary": "Flaw in streaming state in orion",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly reset a streaming state. Resetting a streaming state, without finalising it first, creates incorrect results. The flaw was corrected by not first checking if the state had already been reset, when calling reset().",
