  "summary": "Force cast a \u0026Vec\u003cT\u003e to \u0026[T]",
  "details": "In function `Table::as_ref`, a reference of vector is force cast to slice. There are multiple problems here:\n1. To guarantee the size is correct, we have to first do `Vec::shrink_to_fit`. The function requires a mutable reference, so we have to force cast from immutable to mutable, which is UB.\n2. Even if (1) is sound, `\u0026Vec\u003cT\u003e` and `\u0026[T]` still might not have the same layout. Treating them equally may lead to UB.",
