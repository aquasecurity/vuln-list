  "summary": "frost-core: refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIt was not clear that it is not possible to change `min_signers` (i.e. the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (`frost_core::keys::refresh` module). Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold; however, this could cause a security loss to the participant's shares. We have not determined the exact security implications of doing so and judged simpler to just validate `min_signers`. \n\n If for some reason you have done a refresh share procedure with a smaller `min_signers` we strongly recommend migrating to a new key. \n\n### Patches\n\nUpdating to 2.2.0 will ensure that the `min_signers` parameter will be validated. However it won't restore the security of groups refreshed with a smaller `min_signers` parameters.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou don't need to update if you don't use the refresh share functionality, or if you didn't try to change the `min_signers` parameter using the refresh share functionality.\n\n### References\n\nThank you [BlockSec](https://blocksec.com/) for reporting the finding",
