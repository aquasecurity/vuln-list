  "summary": "HPACK decoder panics on invalid input",
  "details": "Due to insufficient checking of input data, decoding certain data sequences can lead to _Decoder::decode_ panicking rather than returning an error.\n\nExample code that triggers this vulnerability looks like this:\n\n```rust\nuse hpack::Decoder;\n\npub fn main() {\n  let input = \u0026[0x3f];\n  let mut decoder = Decoder::new();\n  let _ = decoder.decode(input);\n}\n```\n\nhpack is unmaintained. A crate with the panics fixed has been published as [hpack-patched](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched).\n\nAlso consider using [fluke-hpack](https://crates.io/crates/fluke-hpack) or [httlib-huffman](https://crates.io/crates/httlib-huffman) as an alternative.",
