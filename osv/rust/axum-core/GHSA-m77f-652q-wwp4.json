  "summary": "axum-core has no default limit put on request bodies",
  "details": "`\u003cbytes::Bytes as axum_core::extract::FromRequest\u003e::from_request` would not, by default, set a limit for the size of the request body. That meant if a malicious peer would send a very large (or infinite) body your server might run out of memory and crash.\n\nThis also applies to these extractors which used `Bytes::from_request` internally:\n- `axum::extract::Form`\n- `axum::extract::Json`\n- `String`\n\nThe fix is also in `axum-core` `0.3.0.rc.2` but `0.3.0.rc.1` _is_ vulnerable.\n\nBecause `axum` depends on `axum-core` it is vulnerable as well. The vulnerable versions of `axum` are `\u003c= 0.5.15` and `0.6.0.rc.1`. `axum` `\u003e= 0.5.16` and `\u003e= 0.6.0.rc.2` does have the fix and are not vulnerable.\n\nThe patched versions will set a 2 MB limit by default.\n",
