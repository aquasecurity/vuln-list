  "summary": "Library exclusively intended to inject UB into safe Rust.",
  "details": "Quoting from the crate description:\n\n\u003e This crate is created purely to inject undefined behavior into stable, safe rust.\n\nSpecifically, the `inconceivable!` macro is insta-UB if the `ub_inconceivable` feature is enabled by *any* reverse dependency.\nThe value this adds is questionable, and hides `unsafe` code from naive analysis.",
