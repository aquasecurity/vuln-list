  ],
  "summary": "sccache vulnerable to privilege escalation if server is run as root",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nOn Linux the `sccache` client can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a local `sccache` server, by preloading the code in a shared library passed to `LD_PRELOAD`.\n\nIf the server is run as root (which is the default when installing the [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/sccache)), this means a user running the `sccache` client can get root privileges.\n\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to 0.4.0\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't run sccache server as root. \n\n###  GitHub Security Lab number\n\nGHSL-2023-046",
