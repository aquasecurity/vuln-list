  "summary": "`dlopen_derive` is unmaintained",
  "details": "`dlopen_derive` hasn't been updated since June 9, 2019.\n\n`dlopen_derive` depends on [`quote = \"0.6.12\"`] and [`syn = \"0.15.34\"`]. Versions `1.0.0` of these dependencies were published on August 13, 2019. The `0.*` versions haven't received updates since.\n\nNote that `dlopen` is an unmaintained crate from the same repository as `dlopen_derive`. However, migrating away from `dlopen_derive` implies migrating away from `dlopen`, as well.\n\n## Recommended alternatives\n\n- [`dlopen2_derive`] (and `dlopen2`)\n\n[`dlopen2_derive`]: https://github.com/OpenByteDev/dlopen2\n[`quote = \"0.6.12\"`]: https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/releases/tag/0.6.12\n[`syn = \"0.15.34\"`]: https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/releases/tag/0.15.34",
