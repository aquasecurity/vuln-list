  "summary": "Starship vulnerable to shell injection via undocumented, unpredictable shell expansion in custom commands",
  "details": "## Description \nStarship is a cross-shell prompt. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.20.0, undocumented and unpredictable shell expansion and/or quoting rules make it easily to accidentally cause shell injection when using custom commands with starship in bash. Version 1.20.0 fixes the vulnerability.\n\n### PoC\nHave some custom command which prints out information from a potentially untrusted/unverified source.\n```\n[custom.git_commit_name]\ncommand = 'git show -s --format=\"%\u003c(25,mtrunc)%s\"'\nstyle = \"italic\"\nwhen = true\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis issue only affects users with custom commands, so the scope is limited, and without knowledge of others' commands, it could be hard to successfully target someone.
