  "summary": "Soundness issues in `raw-cpuid`",
  "details": "## Undefined behavior in `as_string()` methods\n\n`VendorInfo::as_string()`, `SoCVendorBrand::as_string()`,\nand `ExtendedFunctionInfo::processor_brand_string()` construct byte slices\nusing `std::slice::from_raw_parts()`, with data coming from\n`#[repr(Rust)]` structs. This is always undefined behavior.\n\nSee https://github.com/gz/rust-cpuid/issues/40.\n\nThis flaw has been fixed in v9.0.0, by making the relevant structs\n`#[repr(C)]`.\n\n## `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` is unsound\n\n`native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` exposes the unsafe `__cpuid_count()` intrinsic\nfrom `core::arch::x86` or `core::arch::x86_64` as a safe function, and uses\nit internally, without checking the\n[safety requirement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/arch/index.html#overview):\n\n\u003e The CPU the program is currently running on supports the function being\n\u003e called.\n\nCPUID is available in most, but not all, x86/x86_64 environments. The crate\ncompiles only on these architectures, so others are unaffected.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that affected programs are expected\nto crash deterministically every time.\n\nSee https://github.com/gz/rust-cpuid/issues/41.\n\nThe flaw has been fixed in v9.0.0, by intentionally breaking compilation\nwhen targeting SGX or 32-bit x86 without SSE. This covers all affected CPUs.",
