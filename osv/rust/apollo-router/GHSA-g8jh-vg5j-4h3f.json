  "summary": "Apollo Router Improperly Enforces Renamed Access Control Directives",
  "details": "# Summary \nA vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed for unauthorized access to protected data through schema elements with access control directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`) that were renamed via `@link` imports. Router did not enforce renamed access control directives on schema elements (e.g. fields and types), allowing queries to bypass those element-level access controls.\n\n## Details\n\nApollo Federation allows users to specify access control directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authorization-directives)) to protect schema data access at the element level. These directives can optionally be renamed via the [`imports` argument to the `@link` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/reference/directives#renaming-directives), which can be useful if their default names match an existing user-defined directive in their subgraph schema. However, Apollo Router's access control logic ignored the `imports` argument, and would accordingly ignore access control directives that were renamed in this way.\n\n## Who Is Impacted\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Apollo Router customers defining `@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, or `@policy` directives on schema elements that were renamed via `@link` imports are impacted.\n\n### Scope of Impact\n\nThe vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to craft a query that can bypass access control requirements on schema elements protected by renamed access control directives.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in Apollo Router by updating the access control logic to handle the `imports` argument in `@link` directives. You will need to update Router to one of the following versions:\n\n- 1.61.12+\n- 2.8.1+\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- If you are not immediately updating Router to a patched version, you should remove any renames of access control directives in the `imports` argument to the `@link` directive.\n- Customers not using Apollo Router with renamed access control directives (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`) are not affected and do not need to take action.",
