  "summary": "Data races in rusb",
  "details": "Affected versions of rusb did not require UsbContext to implement Send and Sync. However, through Device and DeviceHandle it is possible to use UsbContexts across threads. This issue allows non-thread safe UsbContext types to be used concurrently leading to data races and memory corruption. The issue was fixed by adding Send and Sync bounds to UsbContext.",
