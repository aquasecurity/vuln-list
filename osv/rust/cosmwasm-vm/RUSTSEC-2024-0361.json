  "details": "Some Wasm operations take significantly more gas than our benchmarks indicated. This can lead to missing the gas target we defined by a factor of ~10x. This means a malicious contract could take 10 times as much time to execute as expected, which can be used to temporarily DoS a chain.\n\nFor more information, see [CWA-2024-004](https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2024-004.md).",
