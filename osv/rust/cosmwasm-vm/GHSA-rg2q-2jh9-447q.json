  "details": "**Component:** wasmvm\n**Criticality:** Medium ([ACMv1](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md): I:Moderate; L:Likely)\n**Patched versions:** wasmvm 1.5.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2\n\nSome Wasm operations take significantly more gas than our benchmarks indicated. This can lead to missing the [gas target](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/e50490c4199a234200a497219b27f071c3409f58/docs/GAS.md#cosmwasm-gas-pricing) we defined by a factor of ~10x. This means a malicious contract could take 10 times as much time to execute as expected, which can be used to temporarily DoS a chain.\n\nSee [CWA-2024-004](https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2024-004.md) for more details.\n",
