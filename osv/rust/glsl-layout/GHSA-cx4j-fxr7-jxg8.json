  "summary": "Double free in glsl-layout",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate did not guard against panic within the user-provided function f (2nd parameter of fn map_array), and thus panic within f causes double drop of a single object.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in the 0.4.0 release by wrapping the object vulnerable to a double drop within ManuallyDrop\u003cT\u003e.",
