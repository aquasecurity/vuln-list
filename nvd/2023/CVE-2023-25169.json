In affected versions a user present in a yearly review topic that is then anonymised will still have some data linked to its original account. This issue has been patched in commit `b3ab33bbf7` which is included in the latest version of the Discourse Yearly Review plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the `yearly_review_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to edit the anonymised user's old data in the yearly review topics manually."
