    "Description": "There is a vulnerability in Paginator which makes it susceptible to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks via input parameters to the `paginate()` function.\n\n### Impact\nThere is a vulnerability in Paginator which makes it susceptible to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks via input parameters to the `paginate()` function. This will potentially affect all current users of `Paginator` prior to version \u003e= 1.0.0.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 1.0.0 and all users should upgrade to this version immediately. Note that this patched version uses a dependency that requires an Elixir version \u003e=1.5.\n\n### Credits\n\nThank you to Peter St√∂ckli.",
