    "Description": "### Impact ###\n\nyouki utilizes bind mounting the container's `/dev/null` as a file mask. When performing this operation, the initial validation of the source `/dev/null` was insufficient. Specifically, we initially failed to verify whether `/dev/null` was genuinely present. However, we did perform validation to ensure that the `/dev/null` path existed within the container, including checking for symbolic links. Additionally, there was a vulnerability in the timing between validation and the actual mount operation.\n\nAs a result, by replacing `/dev/null` with a symbolic link, we can bind-mount arbitrary files from the host system.\n\nThis is a different project, but the core logic is similar to the CVE in runc. Issues were identified in runc, and verification was also conducted in youki to confirm the problems.\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Lei Wang (@ssst0n3 from Huawei) for finding and reporting the original runc's vulnerability (Attack 1), and Li Fubang (@lifubang from acmcoder.com, CIIC) for discovering another attack vector in runc (Attack 2) based on @ssst0n3's initial findings.\n\nAlso, @cyphar helped youki in finding the problem.",
