    "Description": "When a `Some(...)` value was passed to the `properties` argument of either of these functions, a use-after-free would result.\n\nIn practice this would nearly always result in OpenSSL treating the properties as an empty string (due to `CString::drop`'s behavior).\n\nThe maintainers thank [quitbug](https://github.com/quitbug/) for reporting this vulnerability to us.",
