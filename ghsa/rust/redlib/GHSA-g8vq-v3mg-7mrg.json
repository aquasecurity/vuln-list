    "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Redlib where an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) condition by submitting a specially crafted base2048-encoded DEFLATE decompression bomb to the restore_preferences form. This leads to excessive memory consumption and potential system instability, which can be exploited to disrupt Redlib instances. This vulnerability was introduced in 2e95e1fc6e2064ccfae87964b4860bda55eddb9a and fixed in 15147cea8e42f6569a11603d661d71122f6a02dc.\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis vulnerability allows a remote attacker with network access to exploit the preference restoration mechanism by providing a compressed payload that expands dramatically upon decompression. The issue arises because the system automatically decompresses user-supplied data without enforcing size limits, potentially leading to:\n\n- Out-of-memory (OOM) conditions\n- OS-level resource exhaustion, potentially leading to broader system instability or crashes\n- Repeated exploitation, keeping the target system in a persistent degraded state\n- Denial-of-service of any public instance\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in 15147cea8e42f6569a11603d661d71122f6a02dc. Users should upgrade to v0.36.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nUntil a patch is available, users can:\n\n- Implement request size limits at the web server or application level to reject excessively large inputs.\n- Disable or restrict the restore_preferences route (`/settings/encoded-restore`) at the reverse-proxy level if not required.\n- Monitor server logs for unusually large or repeated restore_preferences requests and block offending IPs.",
