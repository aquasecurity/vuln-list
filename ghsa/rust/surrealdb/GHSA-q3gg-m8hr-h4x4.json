    "Description": "The `rquickjs` crate used by SurrealDB implements Rust bindings to the QuickJS C library and is used to execute SurrealDB scripting functions. The `rquickjs` function `Exception::throw_type` takes a string and returns an error object. Prior to version `0.4.2` of the crate, this string would be fed directly into `printf`, which will receive the error string as a format string with no additional arguments, leading to undefined behavior. This issue triggers when a SurrealDB scripting function returns an error and its input contains a format string such as `%s` or `%d`. \n\nThis vulnerability can only affect SurrealDB servers explicitly enabling the scripting capability with `--allow-scripting` or `--allow-all` and equivalent environment variables `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_SCRIPT=true` and `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_ALL=true`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker with privileges to execute scripting functions with arbitrary inputs may be able to exploit this format string vulnerability in order read arbitrary memory from the remote SurrealDB process. A format string vulnerability may also be further exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SurrealDB process.\n\nThe fact that error messages are limited to 256 bytes coupled with [exploit mitigation features supported in Rust executables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/exploit-mitigations.html#exploit-mitigations-1) may somewhat increase the complexity of exploiting this vulnerability to reliably achieve remote code execution in practice.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 1.1.1 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers unable to update should restrict access from untrusted users to define and execute scripting functions. This can be achieved by removing the scripting capability by default or with `--deny-scripting` and equivalent environment variable `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_SCRIPT=true`. If not possible, network access should be limited to trusted users.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/3327\n- https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/3332\n- https://github.com/DelSkayn/rquickjs/pull/247",
