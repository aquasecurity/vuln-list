    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIf\n - you are using a SQLPage version older than v0.11.1 \n - your SQLPage instance is exposed publicly\n - the database connection string is specified in the `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` configuration file (not in an environment variable)\n - the web_root is the current working directory (the default)\n - your database is exposed publicly\n\nthen an attacker could retrieve the database connection information from SQLPage and use it to connect to your database directly.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to [v0.11.1](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/releases/tag/v0.11.1) as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade immediately:\n\n - Using an environment variable instead of the configuration file to specify the database connection string prevents exposing it on vulnerable versions.\n - Using a different [web root](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/blob/main/configuration.md) (that is not a parent of the SQLPage configuration directory) fixes the issue.\n - And in any case, you should generally avoid exposing your database publicly \n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/89\n",
