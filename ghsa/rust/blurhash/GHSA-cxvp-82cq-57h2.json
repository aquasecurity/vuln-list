    "Description": "### Impact\nThe blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input.\n\nIn a typical deployment, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network. These may include:\n- UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters\n\n### Patches\nThe patches will be released under version 0.2.0, which requires user intervention because of slight API churn.\n\n### Workarounds\nn.a.\n\n### References\nn.a.\n",
