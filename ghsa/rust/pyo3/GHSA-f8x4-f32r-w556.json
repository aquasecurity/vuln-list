    "Description": "## Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6jgw-rgmm-7cv6. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Advisory\n\nThe family of functions to read \"borrowed\" values from Python weak references were fundamentally unsound, because the weak reference does itself not have ownership of the value. At any point the last strong reference could be cleared and the borrowed value would become dangling.\n\nIn PyO3 0.22.4 these functions have all been deprecated and patched to leak a strong reference as a mitigation. PyO3 0.23 will remove these functions entirely.\n\n",
