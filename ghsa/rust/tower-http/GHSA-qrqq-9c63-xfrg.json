    "Description": "`tower_http::services::fs::ServeDir` didn't correctly validate Windows paths, meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\nThis only impacts Windows. Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this.\n\nSee [tower-http#204] for more details.\n\n[tower-http#204]: https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/pull/204\n",
