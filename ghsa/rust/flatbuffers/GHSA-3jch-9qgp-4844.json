    "Description": "Code generated by flatbuffers' compiler is `unsafe` but not marked as such.\nSee https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6627 for details.\n\nAll users that use generated code by `flatbuffers` compiler are recommended to:\n1. not expose flatbuffer generated code as part of their public APIs\n2. audit their code and look for any usage of `follow`, `push`, or any method that uses them\n   (e.g. `self_follow`).\n3. Carefuly go through the crates' documentation to understand which \"safe\" APIs are not\n   intended to be used.\n",
