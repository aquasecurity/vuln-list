    "Description": "The compression and decompression function used `mem:uninitialized` to create an array of uninitialized values, to later write values into it. This later leads to reads from uninitialized memory.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit b633bf265e41c60dfce3be7eac4e4dd5e18d06cf by using a heap-allocated `Vec` and removing out use of `mem::uninitialized`. The fix was released in v0.3.2 and v1.0.0\n\nSubsequently, the crate was deprecated and its use is discouraged.\n",
