    "Description": "### Impact\n\nFor tracexec's command line reconstruction feature, when a traced process executes another process with a environment variable where the key starts with a dash, tracexec incorrectly shows its commandline where such environment variables could cause argument injection for the `env` command.\nSuch an injection is completely at the UI level unless the user tries to copy the command line with the injection and paste it into a terminal to execute it.\n\nA minimal POC is executing `env -- -a=b bash --norc` in tracexec's TUI mode. The resulting command line of `env` executing bash would be `env -a bash -a=b  _=/usr/bin/env /usr/bin/bash --norc` in tracexec's TUI, which injects `-a=b` into `env`'s arguments.\n\nThis has very limited effect for security.  A local adversarial could leverage this to make tracexec show an inaccurate reconstructed commandline for their executed command. If the user of tracexec decides to copy and run the reconstructed commandline,\nthere could be injection for `env`'s `--block-signal`, `--default-signal`, `--ignore-signal`, `--split-string`, `--unset`, `--chdir`, `--argv0` arguments.\n\n### Patches\nThe fix is https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/pull/118. Users are advised to upgrade to 0.14.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDon't blindly paste and execute commands copied from tracexec that contains environment variable where the key starts with a dash.",
