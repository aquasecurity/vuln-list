    "Description": "ArcIntern::drop has a race condition where it can release memory which is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference to freed memory.\n\nThis was fixed by serializing access to an interned object while it is being deallocated.\n\nVersions prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem.",
