    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe versions of Deno between release 1.18.0 and 1.20.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to an attack where a malicious actor controlling the code executed in a Deno runtime could bypass permission checks and execute arbitrary shell code.\n\nThere is **no** evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.\n\nThis vulnerability does **not** affect users of Deno Deploy.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Deno 1.20.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround. All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.20.3 immediately\n\n---\n\nThe cause of this error was that certain FFI operations did not correctly check for permissions. The issue was fixed in [this](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/14115) pull request.",
