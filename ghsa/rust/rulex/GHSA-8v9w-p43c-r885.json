    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result.\n\nThis is a security concern for you, if\n- your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and\n- your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex panics.\n\n### Patches\nThe crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can use `catch_unwind` to recover from panics.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [rulex](https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/issues)\n* Email me at [ludwig.stecher@gmx.de](mailto:ludwig.stecher@gmx.de)\n\n### Credits\n\nCredit for finding these bugs goes to\n\n- [cargo fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) and [afl.rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs)\n- [evanrichter](https://github.com/evanrichter)\n- [ForAllSecure Mayhem](https://forallsecure.com/)",
