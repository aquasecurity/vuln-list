    "Description": "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the Rust wrapper for libnftnl, triggered via the nftnl::Batch::with_page_size constructor. When a small or malformed page size is provided, the underlying C code allocates an insufficient buffer, leading to out-of-bounds writes during batch initialization.\n\nThe flaw was fixed in commit 94a286f by adding an overflow check:\n```Rust\nbatch_page_size\n    .checked_add(crate::nft_nlmsg_maxsize())\n    .expect(\"batch_page_size is too large and would overflow\");\n```\nThe fix has not been added to the Rust registry at the time of publish.",
