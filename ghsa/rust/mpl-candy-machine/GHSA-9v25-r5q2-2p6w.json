    "Description": "A problem with Candy Machine V2 allow minting NFTs to an arbitrary collection due to a missing check.\n\nHere is a description of the exploit:\nDetails:\nHere is the tx/ix to exploit:\nTransaction:\nIx 1: candy_machine v2, mint_nft, passing in empty metadata -1\nIx 2: custom handler, 0\n\t\tcpi A --\u003e token_metadata create_metadata_account, creates NFT\n\t\tcpi B --\u003e candy_machine v2, set_collection_during_mint\nIx 1 passes our first check for empty metadata, but eventually will hit a bot tax and return Ok.  We do have a CPI check in this function but even if we hit that or moved it to the top, it returns Ok as a bot tax and still enables the issue.\nIx 2, cpi A is Ok and mints an arbitrary NFT.\nIx 2, cpi B checks the previous instruction using index_relative_to_current-1.  This turns out to be Ix 1 which was Ok, so then your newly minted arbitrary NFT is successfully added to the collection.\nConclusion:\nCandy machine could be out of NFTs and it still works.  If the CM is closed, (we think?) it doesn't get to the check.\nThe fix needs to be in set_collection_during_mint that current program ID id candy_machine_v2.  It checks previous program ID but doesn't check current.\n\nNOTE: THIS DOES NOT AFFECT Cmv3\n",
