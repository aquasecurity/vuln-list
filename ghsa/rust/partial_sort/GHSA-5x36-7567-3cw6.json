    "Description": "Affected versions of this crate were using a debug assertion to validate the `last` parameter of `partial_sort()`. This would allow invalid inputs to cause an out-of-bounds read instead of immediately panicking, when compiled without debug assertions.\n\nAll writes are bounds-checked, so the out-of-bounds memory access is read-only. This also means that the first attempted out-of-bounds write will panic, limiting the possible reads.\n\nThe accessible region is further limited by an initial bounds-checked read at `(last / 2) - 1`, i.e., it is proportional to the size of the vector.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in v0.2.0.\n",
