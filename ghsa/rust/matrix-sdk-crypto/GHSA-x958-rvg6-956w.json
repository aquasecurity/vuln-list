    "Description": "### Summary\n\nmatrix-sdk-crypto since version 0.8.0 up to 0.11.0 does not correctly validate the sender of an encrypted event. Accordingly, a malicious homeserver operator can modify events served to clients, making those events appear to the recipient as if they were sent by another user.\n\nAlthough the CVSS score is 4.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N), we consider this a High Severity security issue.\n\n### Details\n\nThe Matrix specification [requires](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.14/client-server-api/#mmegolmv1aes-sha2) that clients ensure that \"the event’s `sender`, `room_id`, and the recorded `session_id` match a trusted session\". The vulnerable matrix-sdk-crypto versions check that the `room_id` matches that of the session denoted by `session_id`, but do not check the `sender`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is resolved by [13c1d20](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/13c1d2048286bbabf5e7bc6b015aafee98f04d55), included in versions 0.11.1 and 0.12.0 of matrix-sdk-crypto.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSince a successful attack requires administrator access to the homeserver, users who trust the administrators of their local homeserver are not affected.\n\n### References\n\n * https://spec.matrix.org/v1.14/client-server-api/#mmegolmv1aes-sha2",
