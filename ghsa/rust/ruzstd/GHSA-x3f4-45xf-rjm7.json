    "Description": "Affected versions of `ruzstd` miscalculate the length of the allocated and init section of its internal `RingBuffer`, leading to uninitialized or out-of-bounds reads in `copy_bytes_overshooting` of up to 15 bytes.\n\nThis may result in up to 15 bytes of memory contents being written into the decoded data when decompressing a crafted archive. This may occur multiple times per archive.\n",
