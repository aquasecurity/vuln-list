    "Description": "### Impact\n\nPrior to `ethereum` crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for \"legacy\" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions.\n\nThis is a specification deviation and therefore a high severity advisory if the `ethereum` crate is used for Ethereum mainnet. Note that signature malleability itself is not a security issue, and therefore if the `ethereum` crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain, it's a low/informational severity advisory.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in `ethereum` v0.18.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can also manually check transaction malleability outside of the crate. But it's recommended to simply upgrade the version.\n\n### References\n\nSee PR: https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/pull/67",
