    "Description": "An SQL injection vulnerability in the `EventCache::find_event_with_relations` method of matrix-sdk 0.11 and 0.12 allows malicious room members to execute arbitrary SQL commands in Matrix clients that directly pass relation types provided by those room members into this method, when used with the default sqlite-based store backend. Exploitation is unlikely, as no known clients currently use the API in this manner.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPassing only trusted (or sanitised) relation types to the `filter` argument of `EventCache::find_event_with_relations()` avoids the issue.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in matrix-sdk 0.13.\n\n### References\n\nThe issue was introduced in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4849.",
