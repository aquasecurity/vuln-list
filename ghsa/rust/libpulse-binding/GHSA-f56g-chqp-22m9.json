    "Description": "### Overview\n\nVersion 2.5.0 of the `libpulse-binding` Rust crate, released on the 22nd of December 2018, fixed a potential use-after-free issue with property list iteration due to a lack of a lifetime constraint tying the lifetime of a `proplist::Iterator` to the `Proplist` object for which it was created. This made it possible for users, without experiencing a compiler error/warning, to destroy the `Proplist` object before the iterator, thus destroying the underlying C object the iterator works upon, before the iterator may be finished with it.\n\nThis advisory is being written retrospectively, having previously only been noted in the changelog. No CVE assignment was sought.\n\nThis impacts all versions of the crate before 2.5.0 back to 1.0.5. Before version 1.0.5 the function that produces the iterator was broken to the point of being useless.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers are required to update to version 2.5.0 or newer.\n\nVersions older than 2.5.0 have been yanked from crates.io as of the 22nd of October 2020.",
