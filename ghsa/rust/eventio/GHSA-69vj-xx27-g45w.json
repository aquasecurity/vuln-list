    "Description": "Input\u003cR\u003e implements Send without requiring R: Send.\n\nAffected versions of this crate allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to undefined behavior such as data race and memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 0.5.1 by adding R: Send bound to the Send impl of Input\u003cR\u003e.",
