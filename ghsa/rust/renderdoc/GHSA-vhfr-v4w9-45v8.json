    "Description": "Affected versions of this crate exposed several methods which took self by immutable reference, despite the requesting the RenderDoc API to set a mutable value internally. This is technically unsound and calling these methods from multiple threads without synchronization could lead to unexpected and unpredictable behavior. The flaw was corrected in release 0.5.0.",
