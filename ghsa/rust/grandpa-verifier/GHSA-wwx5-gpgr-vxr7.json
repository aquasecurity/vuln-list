    "Description": "A critical vulnerability was discovered in the `ismp-grandpa` crate, that allowed a malicious prover easily convince the verifier of the finality of arbitrary headers.\n\n### Description\n\nThe vulnerability manifests as a verifer that only accepts incorrect signatures of Grandpa precommits and was introduced in this [specific commit](https://github.com/polytope-labs/ismp-substrate/pull/64/commits/5ca3351a19151f1a439c30d5cbdbfdc72a11f1a8#diff-3835cc24fb2011b3e8246036059acd8c2c2a9a869eedf7a210d18edb6543318dL262). Perhaps due to unfamiliarity with core substrate APIs.  The `if` statement should have included a negation check, similar to the previous code, but this was omitted. Causing the verifier to **only** accept invalid signatures.\n\nThis vulnerability remained undetected even with [integration tests](https://github.com/polytope-labs/ismp-substrate/pull/64/commits/04d5be207b082eb61d586d52e1685e2e060347e6#diff-4aedbca82d26bebc03f274e23fd5697c3346ffff54405c87af9018f3aef708b2R1-R160), as the prover was also [misconfigured](https://github.com/polytope-labs/ismp-substrate/pull/64/commits/b26894913b301061b07db61af841ca2586415f08#diff-493a6129d75fe31185e28695a4d2adc1582fe9df12462e380fe994f170fc1e70L159) to initialize the Grandpa verifier with the incorrect authority `set_id`. This causes verification of honest precommit signatures to fail as the message is now malformed, but  the verifier indeed only accepts signatures or messages that fail the verification check.\n\nBut even more devastatingly, the verifier will also accept malicious GRANDPA signatures for any precommit message.\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in this [commit](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/pull/372/commits/f0e85db718f5165b06585a49b14a66f8ad643aea) and a patch release has been published.\n\n### Impact\nThis could be used to steal funds or compromise other kinds of cross-chain applications.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in the latest version of `ismp-granpda` `v15.0.1`\n\n### Recommendations\nUsers who rely on the compromised versions must upgrade immediately, as all vulnerable versions of the crate has been yanked.\n",
