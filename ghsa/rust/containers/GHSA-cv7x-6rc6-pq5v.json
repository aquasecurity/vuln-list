    "Description": "Upon panic in a user-provided function f, fn mutate() \u0026 fn mutate2 drops twice a same object.\n\nAffected versions of this crate did not guard against double drop while temporarily duplicating an object's ownership with ptr::read().\n\nDropping a same object can result in memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version \"0.9.11\" by fixing the code to abort upon panic.",
