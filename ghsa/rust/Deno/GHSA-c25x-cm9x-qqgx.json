    "Description": "### Impact\n\n[Resizable ArrayBuffers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-resizablearraybuffer) passed to asynchronous native functions that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an out-of-bound read/write.\n\nIt is unlikely that this has been exploited in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0.\n\nDeno Deploy users are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been resolved by disabling resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. A future version of Deno will re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrade to Deno 1.32.1, or run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers.",
