    "Description": "# Summary\n\nA denial of service vulnerability was discovered in ntpd-rs where an attacker can induce a message storm between two NTP servers running ntpd-rs.\n\n# Details\n\nSince ntpd-rs version 1.2.0, when configured as a server, incorrectly responded to all NTP messages sent to the server's port with a time reply, including to responses from other servers. As a consequence, a message with a spoofed IP address of another server could cause two servers running ntpd-rs to continually respond to each other, consuming significant amounts of resources.\n\n# Impact\n\nAny time server running ntpd-rs with version between 1.2.0 and 1.6.1 inclusive which allows non-NTS traffic is affected. Client-only configurations are not affected. Affected users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.2 as soon as possible.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nShould upgrading not be possible, the impact of the issue can be mitigated by:\n - Whitelisting access to only IP addresses of clients using the server, using the ignore filter method.\n - Blocking incoming non-request traffic on the NTP server port using a firewall.\n - Disabling public access to the vulnerable NTP server\n - Disabling the server functionality by removing any [server] sections from the configuration.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe ntpd-rs authors thank Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-Sec GmbH for finding and reporting this issue.",
