    "Description": "Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:\n\n - Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references\n - Unsoundly extending lifetimes of strings\n - Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects that cannot be safely sent between threads\n\nThis may result in a variety of memory corruption scenarios, most likely use-after-free.\n \nA signficant refactoring effort has been conducted to resolve these issues.\n",
