    "Description": "### Summary\nIf a user begins entering a password but does not press return for an extended period, a password timeout may occur. When this happens, the keystrokes that were entered are echoed back to the console.\n\n### Example\nUsing sudo-rs:\n```\ngeiger@cerberus:~$ sudo -s\n[sudo: authenticate] Password: sudo-rs: timed out\ngeiger@cerberus:~$ testtesttest\n```\n\n\"testtesttest\" was entered at the password prompt but not confirmed by pressing return and then waiting for the timeout.\n\n### Impact\nThis could reveal partial password information, possibly exposing history files when not carefully handled by the user and on screen, usable for Social Engineering or Pass-By attacks.\n\n### Versions affected\nPasswords timeouts were added in sudo-rs 0.2.7 (with a default set to 5 minutes).\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was discovered and reported by @DevLaTron.",
