    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the rand_core crate before 0.6.2 for Rust. Because `read_u32_into` and `read_u64_into` mishandle certain buffer-length checks, a random number generator may be seeded with too little data. The vulnerability was introduced in v0.6.0. The advisory doesn't apply to earlier minor version numbers.\n\nBecause read_u32_into and read_u64_into mishandle certain buffer-length checks, a random number generator may be seeded with too little data.",
