    "Description": "Version 0.6.0 of the `simple_asn1` crate panics on certain malformed\ninputs to its parsing functions, including `from_der` and `der_decode`.\nBecause this crate is frequently used with inputs from the network, this\nshould be considered a security vulnerability.\n\nThe issue occurs when parsing the old ASN.1 \"UTCTime\" time format.  If an\nattacker provides a UTCTime where the first character is ASCII but the\nsecond character is above 0x7f, a string slice operation in the\n`from_der_` function will try to slice into the middle of a UTF-8\ncharacter, and cause a panic.\n\nThis error was introduced in commit\n[`d7d39d709577710e9dc8`](https://github.com/acw/simple_asn1/commit/d7d39d709577710e9dc8833ee57d200eef366db8),\nwhich updated `simple_asn1` to use `time` instead of `chrono` because of\n[`RUSTSEC-2020-159`](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0159).\nVersions of `simple_asn1` before 0.6.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nThe [patch](https://github.com/acw/simple_asn1/pull/28) was applied in\n`simple_asn1` version 0.6.1.\n",
