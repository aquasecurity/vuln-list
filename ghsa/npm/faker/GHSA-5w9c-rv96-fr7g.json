    "Description": "Faker.js helps users create large amounts of data for testing and development. The maintainer deliberately removed the functional code from this package. This appears to be a purposeful and successful attempt to make the package unusable. This is related to the colors.js [CVE-2021-23567](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gh88-3pxp-6fm8). \n\nThe functional code for this package was forked and can be found [here](https://github.com/faker-js/faker).
