    "Description": "Affected versions of `shell-quote` do not properly escape command line arguments, which may result in command injection if the library is used to escape user input destined for use as command line arguments.\n\n\n\n## Proof of Concept:\n\nThe following characters are not escaped properly: `\u003e`,`;`,`{`,`}`\n\nBash has a neat but not well known feature known as \"Bash Brace Expansion\", wherein a sub-command can be executed without spaces by running it between a set of `{}` and using the `,` instead of ` ` to seperate arguments. Because of this, full command injection is possible even though it was initially thought to be impossible. \n\n```\n   const quote = require('shell-quote').quote;\n   console.log(quote(['a;{echo,test,123,234}']));\n   // Actual                    \"a;{echo,test,123,234}\"\n   // Expected                  \"a\\;\\{echo,test,123,234\\}\"\n   // Functional Equivalent     \"a; echo 'test' '123' '1234'\"\n```\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.6.1 or later.",
