This issue affects anyone requesting content from untrusted sources.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 2.4.0 resolves the issue by limiting the size of buffered response body.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAttempting workarounds isn't recommended. Updating is preferred.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [ethanent/centra](https://github.com/ethanent/centra).\n\n",
