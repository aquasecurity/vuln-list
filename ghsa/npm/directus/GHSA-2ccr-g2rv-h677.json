    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen reaching the /files page, a JWT is passed via GET request. Inclusion of session tokens in URLs poses a security risk as URLs are often logged in various places (e.g., web server logs, browser history). Attackers gaining access to these logs may hijack active user sessions, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions on behalf of the user.\n\n### Patches\n\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround available.\n\n### References\n\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n",
