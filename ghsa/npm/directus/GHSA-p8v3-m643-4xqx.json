    "Description": "## Summary\nA user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API.\nNormally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n- Set up a simple role with read-access to users.\n- Create a new user with the role from the previous step\n- Assign a password to the user\n\nThe easiest way to confirm this vulnerability is by first visiting `/users/me`. You should be presented with a redacted JSON-object.\nNext, visit `/users/me?alias[hash]=password`. This time, the returned JSON object will included the raw password hash instead of the redacted value.\n\n## Workaround\nThis can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them.",
