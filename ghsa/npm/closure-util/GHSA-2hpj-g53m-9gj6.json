    "Description": "Affected versions of `closure-util` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `closure-util`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate this issue:\n1. Install the package using npm's `--ignore-scripts` flag.\n2. Navigate to the package directory, and open `default-config.json` in a text editor\n3. Change the download URLs in the `compiler_url` and `library_url` to `https` equivalents\n4. run `npm i` in the package directory.",
