    "Description": "## Impact\n\nThe library offers a function to generate an ed25519 key pair via `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate` with an optional param to provide a 32 byte seed value, which will then be used as the secret key. **When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret key using secure randomness**. However, a recent change **broke this guarantee** and **uses an insecure seed for key pair generation**.\n\nSince the private key of this identity (`535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`) is compromised, one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose access to a canister where this principal is the controller. Users are asked to take proactive measures mentioned below in Workarounds:Users to protect their assets. \n\n## Patches\nPatch for the vulnerability is **available in v1.0.1** for all the packages listed in the advisory. Please upgrade and deploy your canisters immediately. \n\n## Workarounds\n\n### Developers\n\nThe recommended fix is to upgrade the package to the patched version. If that is not possible, there are couple of workarounds to handle the insecure key generation.\n\n1. Invoking the function as `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate(null)` would fix the broken conditional evaluation and force the function to generate a securely random seed. However, this is not guaranteed to work for future upgrades.\n2. Passing a securely generated randomness as a seed to `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate` would force the library to use it as the seed to generate the key pair.\n\n### Users\n\n#### Removing a controller of a canister if it's the affected principal\n\nFor all canisters you control, fetch the controllers of the canisters using \n```sh\ndfx canister info --ic \u003cCANISTER\u003e\n```\nIf you see the principal `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe` as one of the controllers, follow the steps below \n```sh\ndfx identity whoami # record CURRENT_IDENTITY\n\ndfx identity new \u003cNEW_IDENTITY_NAME\u003e \ndfx identity use \u003cNEW_IDENTITY_NAME\u003e \ndfx identity get-principal \u003cNEW_IDENTITY_NAME\u003e # record NEW_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL\n\ndfx identity use \u003cCURRENT_IDENTITY\u003e\ndfx canister update-settings --ic \u003cCANISTER\u003e --add-controller \u003cNEW_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL\u003e\ndfx canister update-settings --ic \u003cCANISTER\u003e --remove-controller `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`\n```\nFor more details on canister management, please visit [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters)\n\n#### Checking funds on wallets /  ledgers\n\nIf you have funds on ledgers using a browser wallet, please check if the account principal matches `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`. If it does, please create a new account and transfer the funds to the new account immediately.\n\n## References\n\n1. [fix PR link](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/pull/851)\n2.
