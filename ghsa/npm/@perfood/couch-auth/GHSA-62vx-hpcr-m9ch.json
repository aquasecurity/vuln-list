    "Description": "Session tokens and passwords in couch-auth 0.21.2 are stored in JavaScript objects and remain in memory without explicit clearing in src/user.ts lines 700-707. This creates a window of opportunity for sensitive data extraction through memory dumps, debugging tools, or other memory access techniques, potentially leading to session hijacking.",
