    "Description": "### Impact\n\nSensitive Information leaked via script File in TinaCMS. Sites building with @tinacms/cli \u003e= 1.0.0 \u0026\u0026 \u003c 1.0.9 that store sensitive values in process.env var are impacted. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0 this vulnerability does not affect you.\n\nIf your Tina-enabled website has sensitive credentials stored as environment variables (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys immediately.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading, and rotating secure \u0026 exposed keys is required for the proper fix.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/3584",
