    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWe received a report about a vulnerability in Remix/React Router that affects all Remix 2 and React Router 7 consumers using the Express adapter. Basically, this vulnerability allows anyone to spoof the URL used in an incoming `Request` by putting a URL pathname in the port section of a URL that is part of a `Host` or `X-Forwarded-Host` header sent to a Remix/React Router request handler.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched and released in Remix 2.16.3 React Router 7.4.1.\n\n### Credits\n\n- Rachid Allam (zhero;)\n- Yasser Allam (inzo_)",
