    "Description": "### Impact\nThe gatsby-plugin-mdx plugin prior to versions 3.15.2 and 2.14.1 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized.  The vulnerability is present when passing input in both webpack (MDX files in `src/pages` or MDX file imported as component in frontend / React code) and data mode (querying MDX nodes via GraphQL).  Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced or added into an MDX file.  The following MDX payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id \u003e\u003e /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-plugin-mdx@3.15.2` and `gatsby-plugin-mdx@2.14.1` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine.  The patch introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default.  When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized before processing to avoid a security risk.  Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true` or if it appears that the MDX input is attempting to use the Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\n### Credits\nWe would like to thank Snyk [snyk.io] for initially bringing the issue to our attention, as well as Feng Xiao and Zhongfu Su, who reported the issue to Snyk.\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com).\n",
