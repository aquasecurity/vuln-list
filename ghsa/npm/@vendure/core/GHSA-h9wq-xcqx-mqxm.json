    "Description": "### Impact\nVendure is an e-commerce GraphQL framework with a number of APIs and different levels of\nauthorization. By default the Cookie settings are insecure, having the SameSite setting as false\nwhich results in not having one (originates from the cookie-session npm packageâ€™s default\nsettings).\n\n### Patches\nIn progress\n\n### Workarounds\nManually set the `authOptions.cookieOptions.sameSite` configuration option to `'strict'`, `'lax'` or `true`.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n",
