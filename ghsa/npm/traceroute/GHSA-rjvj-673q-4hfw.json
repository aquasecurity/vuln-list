    "Description": "All versions of `traceroute` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `trace` function is vulnerable and can be abused if the `host` value is controlled by an attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
