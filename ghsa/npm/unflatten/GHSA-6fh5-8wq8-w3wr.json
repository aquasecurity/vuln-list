    "Description": "All versions of `unflatten` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The function `unflatten` does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
