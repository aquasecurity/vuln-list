    "Description": "### Impact\nThe gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time.  Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected.\n\nExample affected gatsby-config.js:\n```\n      resolve: 'gatsby-source-wordpress',\n        auth: {\n          htaccess: {\n            username: leaked_username\n            password: leaked_password,\n          },\n        },\n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section.  Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround at this time, other than manually editing the app.js file post-build.\n\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com)",
