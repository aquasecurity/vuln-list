    "Description": "### Impact\nKaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\\edef` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as an availability attack, where e.g. a client rendering another user's KaTeX input will be unable to use the site due to memory overflow, tying up the main thread, or stack overflow.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nForbid inputs containing the substring `\"\\\\edef\"` before passing them to KaTeX.\n(There is no easy workaround for the auto-render extension.)\n\n### Details\nKaTeX supports an option named `maxExpand` which prevents infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. However, what counted as an \"expansion\" is a single macro expanding to any number of tokens. The expand-and-define TeX command `\\edef` can be used to build up an exponential number of tokens using only a linear number of expansions according to this definition, e.g. by repeatedly doubling the previous definition. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10, where every expanded token in an `\\edef` counts as an expansion.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue or security advisory in the [KaTeX repository](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/)\n* Email us at [katex-security@mit.edu](mailto:katex-security@mit.edu)",
