    "Description": "### Impact\nNode Fetch did not honor the `size` option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a `FetchError` would never get thrown and the process would end without failure.\n\nFor most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after `fetch()` has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.\n\n### Patches\nWe released patched versions for both stable and beta channels:\n\n- For `v2`: 2.6.1\n- For `v3`: 3.0.0-beta.9\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, it is strongly recommended to update as soon as possible.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/new?assignees=\u0026labels=question\u0026template=support-or-usage.md\u0026title=Question%3A+)\n* Contact one of the core maintainers.",
