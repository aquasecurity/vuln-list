    "Description": "### Summary\nA logic error in the main `summaly` function causes the `allowRedirects` option to never be passed to any plugins, and as a result, isn't enforced.\n\n### Details\nIn the main `summaly` function, a new `scrapingOptions` object is created and passed to either the matched plugin, if any, or the default summarize function. The issue here is that the new `scrapingOptions` object is not provided the `allowRedirects` property of `opts`.\n\n### PoC\n- Publish a post containing a link to any URL that redirects on Misskey.\n- A preview will be generated for the target of the redirect, despite Misskey passing `allowRedirects: false`.\n\n### Impact\nMisskey will follow redirects, despite explicitly requesting not to.",
