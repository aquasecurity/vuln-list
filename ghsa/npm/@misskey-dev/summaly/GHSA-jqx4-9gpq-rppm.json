    "Description": "### Summary\nDue to a validation error in `got.scpaping`, it is possible to use an HTTP redirect to avoid IP filtering.\n\n### Details\nIn `got.scpaping`, Summaly first makes a HTTP `HEAD` request to the page being summarized. It then preforms private IP address checks on the `HEAD` response, then makes an additional HTTP `GET` request to the page being summarized. Unfortunately, since private IP address checks aren't performed on the `GET` response, the `GET` response can issue a HTTP redirect to a private IP address, which will succeed, regardless of if private IP addresses are allowed by Summaly.\n\n### PoC\nWith a simple Caddy webserver, you can get Summaly to summarize a page hosted via a local IP address:\n```caddy\n@summaly-bypass-head {\n    method HEAD\n    path /summaly-bypass\n}\n@summaly-bypass-get {\n    method GET\n    path /summaly-bypass\n}\nheader @summaly-bypass-head Content-Type \"text/html\"\nrespond @summaly-bypass-head 200\nredir @summaly-bypass-get http://127.0.0.1:3080/\n```\n\n### Impact\nUsing this bypass, an attacker can probe a victims internal network for HTTP services that aren't supposed to be exposed to the outside world. While they might only have read-only access through this, it may still be possible to extract sensitive information or be used to probe a network prior to attacking via other exploits without leaving a trace.",
