    "Description": "### Impact\nThe library functions `getUserById`, `deleteUser`, `updateUserById`, `listFactors` and `deleteFactor` did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API function being called.\n\nImplementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the `userId` are not affected by this.\n\n### Patches\nStrict value checks have been added to all affected functions. These functions now require that the `userId` and `factorId` parameters MUST be valid UUID (v4).\n\n**Patched version:** \u003e= 2.69.1\n\n### Workarounds\nImplementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the `userId` are not affected by this. It is recommended that users of the auth-js library always follow security best practice and validate all inputs, before passing these to other functions or libraries.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/supabase/auth-js/pull/1063",
