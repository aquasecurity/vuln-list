    "Description": "Affected versions of `airbrake` default to sending environment variables over an unencrypted HTTP connection. In scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible for them to capture and read these environment variables, which may result in leaking sensitive information.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.4.0 or later, or upgrade from the now-deprecated `airbrake` module to its replacement, [`airbrake-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airbrake-js).",
