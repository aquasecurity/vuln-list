Versions 3.1.0 and below are unaffected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for this issue. Please upgrade fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart to version 3.1.3 or higher.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment\nhttps://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail us at [fhir-works-on-aws-dev@amazon.com](mailto:fhir-works-on-aws-dev@amazon.com)\n",
