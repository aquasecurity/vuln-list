    "Description": "Versions of `iobroker.controller` prior to 2.0.25 are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended `/adapter/\u003cadapter-name\u003e` folder, which may allow attackers to include arbitrary files in the system. An attacker would need to be authenticated to perform the attack but the package has authentication disabled by default.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.0.25 or later.",
