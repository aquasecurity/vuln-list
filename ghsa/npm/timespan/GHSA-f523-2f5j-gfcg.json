    "Description": "Affected versions of `timespan` are vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service when parsing dates.\n\nThe amplification for this vulnerability is significant, with 50,000 characters resulting in the event loop being blocked for around 10 seconds.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo direct patch is available for this vulnerability.\n\nCurrently, the best available solution is to use a functionally equivalent alternative package.\n\nIt is also sufficient to ensure that user input is not being passed into `timespan`, or that the maximum length of such user input is drastically reduced. Limiting the input length to 150 characters should be sufficient in most cases.",
