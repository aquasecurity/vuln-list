    "Description": "A vulnerability in **Next.js Middleware** has been fixed in **v14.2.32** and **v15.4.7**. The issue occurred when request headers were directly passed into `NextResponse.next()`. In self-hosted applications, this could allow Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if certain sensitive headers from the incoming request were reflected back into the response.\n\nAll users implementing custom middleware logic in self-hosted environments are strongly encouraged to upgrade and verify correct usage of the `next()` function.\n\nMore details at [Vercel Changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-57822)",
