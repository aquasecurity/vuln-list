    "Description": "### Impact\n\nVulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone running a Next.js app at version \u003e= 12.0.0, and using i18n functionality.\n\n- **Affected:** All of the following must be true to be affected by this CVE\n  - Next.js versions above v12.0.0\n  - Using next start or a custom server\n  - Using the built-in i18n support\n- **Not affected:**\n  - Deployments on Vercel (vercel.com) are not affected along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. We recommend all affected users upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe recommend upgrading whether you can reproduce or not although you can ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until you upgrade.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)\n* Email us at [security@vercel.com](mailto:security@vercel.com)\n",
