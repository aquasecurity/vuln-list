    "Description": "### Impact\nA Denial of Service (DoS) attack allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution.\n\n_Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time._\n\nDeployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.\n\nThis is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel.\n\nThis vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was resolved in Next.js 14.2.21, 15.1.2, and 13.5.8. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to the PackDraw team for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.",
