    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAPI servers running `express-zod-api` having:\n\n- version of `express-zod-api` below `10.0.0-beta1`,\n- and using the following (or similar) validation schema in its implementation: `z.string().email()`,\n\nare vulnerable to a DoS attack due to: \n\n- Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in `zod` versions up to `3.22.2`,\n- depending on `zod`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patched version of `zod` fixing the vulnerability is `3.22.3`.\n\nHowever, it's highly recommended to upgrade `express-zod-api` to at least version `10.0.0`, which does not depend on `zod` strictly and directly, but requires its installation as a peer dependency instead, enabling you to install the patched `zod` version yourself.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen it's not possible to upgrade your dependencies, consider the following replacement in your implementation:\n\n```diff\n- z.string().email()\n+ z.string().regex(\n+   /^(?!\\.)(?!.*\\.\\.)([A-Z0-9_+-\\.]*)[A-Z0-9_+-]@([A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\\-]*\\.)+[A-Z]{2,}$/i\n+ )\n```\n\nThis regular expression is taken from the suggested patch of `zod`.\n\n### References\n\n- Original issue: https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues/2609\n- The patch: https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/pull/2824\n- Entry in database: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4316\n- Enumeration: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html\n- Parent advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m95q-7qp3-xv42\n- Changelog entry for `express-zod-api` version `10.0.0-beta1`: https://github.com/RobinTail/express-zod-api/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1000-beta1",
