    "Description": "### Impact\nUsers could experience false-negative validation outcomes for [MINT](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md#mint---extended-minting-transaction) transaction operations.  A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton.\n\n### Patches\nnpm package [slp-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slp-validate) has been patched and published as version 1.2.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to slp-validate 1.2.1.\n\n### References\n* slp-validate [commit](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-validate/commit/cde95c0c6470dceb4f023cd462f904135ebd73e7)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [slp-validate](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-validate/issues)",
