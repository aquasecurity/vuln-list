    "Description": "### Impact\nUsers could experience false-negative validation outcomes for [MINT](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md#mint---extended-minting-transaction) transaction operations.  A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton.\n\n### Patches\nnpm package [slpjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slpjs) has been patched and published as version 0.27.2.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to slpjs 0.27.2.\n\n### References\n* slpjs [commit](https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/commit/3671be2ffb6d4cfa94c00c6dc8649d1ba1d75754)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [slp-validate](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-validate/issues) or [slpjs](https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/issues)",
