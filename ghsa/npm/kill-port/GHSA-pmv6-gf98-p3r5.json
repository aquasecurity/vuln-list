    "Description": "Versions of `kill-port` prior to 1.3.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `kill` function. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system if user input (such as the port number) is passed directly to the function.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.3.2 or later.",
