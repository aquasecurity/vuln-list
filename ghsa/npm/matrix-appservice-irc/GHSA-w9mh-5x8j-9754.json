    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe fix for GHSA-wm4w-7h2q-3pf7 / [CVE-2024-32000](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32000) included in matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.0 relied on the Matrix homeserver-provided timestamp to determine whether a user has access to the event they're replying to when determining whether or not to include a truncated version of the original event in the IRC message. Since this value is controlled by external entities, a malicious Matrix homeserver joined to a room in which a matrix-appservice-irc bridge instance (before version 2.0.1) is present can fabricate the timestamp with the intent of tricking the bridge into leaking room messages the homeserver should not have access to.\n\n### Patches\n\nmatrix-appservice-irc 2.0.1 [drops the reliance](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1804) on `origin_server_ts` when determining whether or not an event should be visible to a user, instead tracking the event timestamps internally.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to limit the amount of information leaked by setting a reply template that doesn't contain the original message. See [these lines](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/d5d67d1d3ea3f0f6962a0af2cc57b56af3ad2129/config.sample.yaml#L601-L604) in the configuration file.\n\n### References\n\n- Patch: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1804\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security at matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).",
