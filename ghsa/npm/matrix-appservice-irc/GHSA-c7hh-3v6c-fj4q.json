    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIt was possible to craft an event such that it would leak part of a targeted message event from another bridged room. This required knowing an event ID to target.\n\n### Patches\n\nPlease upgrade to 1.0.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can set the `matrixHandler.eventCacheSize` config value to `0` to workaround this bug. However, this may impact performance.\n\n### Credits\n\nDiscovered and reported by [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).",
