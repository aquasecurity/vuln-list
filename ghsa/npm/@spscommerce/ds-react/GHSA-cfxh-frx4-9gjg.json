    "Description": "### Impact\nXSS, anyone using the SPS Select with options prop populated from user input is impacted. If these options are stored, then it could have been a stored XSS. \n\n### Patches\nThe code has been patched for version 7 of woodland. Users should upgrade to 7.17.4 or higher\n\n### Workarounds\nThis is not recommended. If you are not upgrading then you would need to sanitize your options yourself (including those currently stored in databases). This is not recommended.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/SPSCommerce/woodland/blob/c49e999f97f3c0b56502859f4de1e8c6666dd74d/packages/ds-react/src/option-list/SpsOptionList.tsx#L559\n",
