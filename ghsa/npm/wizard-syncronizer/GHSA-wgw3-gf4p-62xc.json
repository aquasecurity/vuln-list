    "Description": "All versions of `wizard-syncronizer` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate input on the `cloneAndSync` function  and concatenates it to an exec call. This can be abused through a malicious widget containing the payload in the `gitURL` value or through a MITM attack since the package does not enforce HTTPS. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
