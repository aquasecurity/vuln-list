    "Description": "Affected versions of `droppy`  are vulnerable to cross-site socket forgery. The package does not perform verification for cross-domain websocket requests, and as a result, an attacker can create a web page that opens up a websocket connection on behalf of the user visiting the page. The attacker can then perform any action that the target user could, including adding a new admin account under their control, or deleting others.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 3.5.0 or later.",
