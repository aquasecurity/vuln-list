    "Description": "Affected versions of `chromedriver` insecurely download resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, they can modify or read such resources at will. This may result in arbitrary code execution if an attacker intercepts and modifies the downloaded binary file, replacing it with a malicious one. \n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 2.26.1 or later.",
