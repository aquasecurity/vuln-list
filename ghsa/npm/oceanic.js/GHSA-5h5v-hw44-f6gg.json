    "Description": "### Impact\nInput to functions such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan` is not url-encoded, resulting in specially crafted input such as `../../../channels/{id}` being normalized into the url `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, and deleting a channel rather than removing a ban.\n\n### Workarounds\n* Sanitizing user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for.\n* Encoding input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library.\n\n### References\nOceanicJS/Oceanic@8bf8ee8373b8c565fbdbf70a609aba4fbc1a1ffe",
