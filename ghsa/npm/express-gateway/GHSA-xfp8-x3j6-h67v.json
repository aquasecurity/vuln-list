    "Description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue exists in ExpressGateway ≤ 1.16.10 in lib/rest/routes/apps.js. User-controlled data returned by the REST endpoint is not sanitized before being rendered by the admin/UI layer, allowing an authenticated, low-privileged actor to store or reflect a payload that executes in a maintainer’s browser when the resource is viewed. The issue can be triggered remotely over the network and does not impact availability. No vendor fix is available at this time.",
