    "Description": "Versions 2.2.4 and earlier of `ldapauth-fork` are affected by an LDAP injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject and run arbitrary LDAP commands via the username parameter.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nldapauth is not actively maintained, having not seen a publish since 2014. As a result, there is no patch available. Consider updating to use [ldapauth-fork](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ldapauth-fork) 2.3.3 or greater.",
