    "Description": "### Impact\nThe `trainBatch` function has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the Limdu library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in version 0.9.5.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use trainBatch with classifiers that rely on shell execution, such as SVM Perf, SVM Linear or Adaboost\n\n### References\nNo",
