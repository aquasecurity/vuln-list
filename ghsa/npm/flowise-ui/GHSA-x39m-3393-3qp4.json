    "Description": "### Summary\nUnverified Email Change - Email as part of Credential / Unverified Account Recovery Channel Change\n\nThe application allows changing the account email address (used as a login identifier and/or password recovery address) without verifying the requester’s authority to make that change (no confirmation to the old email, no authentication step). Because email often functions as a credential or recovery channel, unverified email changes enable attackers to take over accounts by switching the account’s recovery/login address.\n\n### Details\nOccurence - code:\nhttps://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/packages/ui/src/views/account/index.jsx#L211\n\nRemote and physical scenarios can be considered.\n\n### PoC\n**Repro steps:**\n1. As logged in user https://cloud.flowiseai.com/account scroll down to 'Profile' section\n2. Change email to the new email\n3. Notice Unverified Password Change (authenticated change without current password)\n\nLater this email is needed as credentials to log in or reset password feature.\n\n**POC:**\nEmail changed, and notice \"Profile updated\" message.\n\n**Screenshot**\n\u003cimg width=\"329\" height=\"357\" alt=\"secbug\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3c77835-35bb-47dc-8cd2-83e4e266e5a4\" /\u003e\n\n\n### Impact\nFull account takeover (ATO) of affected accounts (loss of confidentiality and integrity of account data).\nUser account recovery mechanisms (password reset flows tied to email) can be bypassed or abused if combined with this issue and the second one which I've reported (similar security issue with the password - part of credentials).
