This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nMalicious code was inserted into the Nx (build system) package and several related plugins. The tampered package was published to the npm software registry, via a supply-chain attack. Affected versions contain code that scans the file system, collects credentials, and posts them to GitHub as a repo under user's accounts.",
