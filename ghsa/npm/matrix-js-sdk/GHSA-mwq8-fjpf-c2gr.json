    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn certain configurations, data sent by remote servers containing special strings in key locations could cause modifications of the `Object.prototype`, disrupting matrix-js-sdk functionality, causing denial of service and potentially affecting program logic.\n\n(This is part 2, where [CVE-2022-36059](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36059) / [GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32) is part 1. Part 2 covers remaining vectors not covered by part 1, found in a codebase audit scheduled after part 1.)\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n\n- [Release blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/03/28/security-releases-matrix-js-sdk-24-0-0-and-matrix-react-sdk-3-69-0)\n- The advisory [GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32) ([CVE-2022-36059](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36059)) refers to an initial set of vulnerable locations discovered and patched in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0. We opted not to disclose that advisory while we performed an audit of the codebase and are now disclosing it jointly with this one.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please email us at [security at matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).\n",
