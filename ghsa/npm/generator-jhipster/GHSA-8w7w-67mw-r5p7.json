    "Description": "### Impact\nFor applications using JWT or session-based authentication (not OIDC), users can input a login string which can cause a denial of service, as parsing it will be too complex.\n\nHere is an example: https://gist.github.com/atomfrede/311f8a9c6eb74c5c5226af0481155207\n\nThe vulnerable expression was never officially released. So only when you generated an application from the master branch between 6.8.0 and 6.9.0 your generated application may be vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nIf you only used official releases you don't need to patch your application.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you have created an application from the master branch, you need to adapt the `LOGIN_REGEX` in `Constants.java`. If your regex is \n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9!#$\u0026'*+=?^_`{|}~.-]+@?[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$\n```\nyou need to change it too \n```\n^(?\u003e[a-zA-Z0-9!$\u0026*+=?^_`{|}~.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*)|(?\u003e[_.@A-Za-z0-9-]+)$\n```\n \nIf you still have `^[_.@A-Za-z0-9-]*$` there is no need to change it, except you would like to support login with `+` sign (e.g. `foo+bar@example.com`).\n\n### References\n\n* https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n* https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking/",
