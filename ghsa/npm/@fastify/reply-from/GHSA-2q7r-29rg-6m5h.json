    "Description": "### Summary\nBy crafting a malicious URL, an attacker could access routes that are not allowed, even though the `reply.from` is defined for specific routes in `@fastify/reply-from`.\n\n### Details\n\nAn attacker can bypass the route defined by the `@fastify/reply-from` package by adding a `..` symbol, which, for `curl` version `8.7.1`, is `%2e%2e`.\n\n### Impact\n\nEveryone is using this package with the routes option to protect a 3rd-party resource.",
