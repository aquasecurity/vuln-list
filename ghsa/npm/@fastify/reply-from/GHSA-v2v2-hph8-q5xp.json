    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe main repo of fastify use [fast-content-type-parse](https://github.com/fastify/fast-content-type-parse) to parse request Content-Type, which will [trim after split](https://github.com/fastify/fast-content-type-parse/blob/2776d054dd48e9ce40b8d5e5ff9b46fee82b95f1/index.js#L59).\n\nThe [fastify-reply-from](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-reply-from/blob/b79a22d6eb9a0b52cfbe8eb2cb22ad65f5a39e64/index.js#L118C14-L118C14) have not use this repo to unify the parse of Content-Type, which [won't trim](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-reply-from/blob/b79a22d6eb9a0b52cfbe8eb2cb22ad65f5a39e64/index.js#L118C14-L118C14).\n\nAs a result, a reverse proxy server built with `@fastify/reply-from` could misinterpret the incoming body by passing an header `ContentType: application/json ; charset=utf-8`. This can lead to bypass of security checks.\n\n### Patches\n\n`@fastify/reply-from` v9.6.0 include the fix. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.\n\n### References\n\nHackerone Report: https://hackerone.com/reports/2295770.",
