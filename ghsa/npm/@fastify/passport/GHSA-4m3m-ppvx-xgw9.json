    "Description": "Applications using `@fastify/passport` for user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to [session fixation attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation) from network and same-site attackers.\n\n## Details\nfastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and [same-site attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website.\n\n## Fix\nAs a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session.\n\n## Credits\n* Pedro Adão (@pedromigueladao), [Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/)\n* Marco Squarcina (@lavish), [Security \u0026 Privacy Research Unit, TU Wien](https://secpriv.wien/)",
