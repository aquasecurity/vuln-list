    "Description": "_This is a historical security advisory, pertaining to a vulnerability that was reported, patched, and published in 2021. It is listed here for completeness and for CVE tracking purposes._\n\n### Impact\nDue to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out.\n\nThis re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted MITM attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fully patched as of v1.17.2.\n\nThe patch commit can be found at https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4\n\n### Workarounds\nSite maintainers can cherry-pick https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4 into their codebase to patch the exploit.\n\n### References\n* https://blogs.opera.com/security/2022/03/bug-bounty-adventures-a-nodebb-0-day/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Discuss it on [our community forum](community.nodebb.org/)\n* Email us at [support@nodebb.org](mailto:support@nodebb.org)\n",
