    "Description": "### Impact\n\nBy crafting a specific URL, it is possible to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service.\nIf the base url of the proxied server is `/pub/`, a user expect that accessing `/priv` on the target service would not be possible. Unfortunately, it is.\n\n[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch have been submitted by Corey Farrell git@cfware.com, the reporter.\nAll releases after v4.0.2 include the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workaround available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [fastify-reply-from](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-reply-from)\n* Email us at [hello@matteocollina.com](mailto:hello@matteocollina.com)",
