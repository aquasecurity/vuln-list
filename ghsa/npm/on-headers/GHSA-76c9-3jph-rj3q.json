    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA bug in on-headers versions `\u003c 1.1.0` may result in response headers being inadvertently modified when an array is passed to `response.writeHead()`\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `1.1.0`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUses are encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue can be worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather than an array.",
