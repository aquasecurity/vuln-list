    "Description": "### Impact\n\nSince v1.3.0, we use our own Request object. This is great, but the `url` behavior is unexpected.\n\nIn the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path.\n\n```ts\nconst req = new Request('http://localhost/static/../foo.txt') // Web-standards\nconsole.log(req.url) // http://localhost/foo.txt\n```\n\nHowever, the `url` in our Request does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned.\n\n```ts\nconst req = new Request('http://localhost/static/../foo.txt')\nconsole.log(req.url) // http://localhost/static/../foo.txt\n```\n\nIt will pass unresolved paths to the web application. This causes vulnerabilities like #123 when using `serveStatic`.\n\nNote: Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so it does not affect you if the user uses them. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them.\n\n### Patches\n\n\"v1.4.1\" includes the change to fix this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDon't use `serveStatic`.\n\n",
