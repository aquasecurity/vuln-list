    "Description": "### Summary\nThe `cuid` package used by `@keystone-6/*` and upstream dependencies is deprecated and [marked as insecure by the author](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid#status-deprecated-due-to-security-use-cuid2-instead).\n\nAs reported by the author\n\u003e Cuid and other k-sortable and non-cryptographic ids (Ulid, ObjectId, KSUID, all UUIDs) are all insecure. Use @paralleldrive/cuid2 instead.\n\n### What are doing about this?\n- [We are waiting on Prisma](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/8282) to add support for [`cuid2`](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2)\n- Alternatively, we might default to a random string ourselves\n\n### What can I do about this?\nWe have added a work-around for users who want to provide custom identifiers in https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8645\n\n### What if I need a `cuid`?\nThe features marked as a security vulnerability by @paralleldrive are sometimes actually needed ([as written in the README of `cuid`](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid#motivation)) - the problem is the inherent risks that features like this can have.\n\nYou might actually want the features of a monotonically increasing (auto-increment, k-sortable), and timestamp-based id as part of your application, and keystone should support that - but you might not want them by _default_.\nThis is why this security advisory has been accepted by me (@dcousens), we currently use cuid identifiers by default, and that should change.\n\n### Impact\nI have accepted this security advisory on the basis that we don't need this kind of identifier typically, and the need for them should be driven by an application's requirements, not a convenient default.\n",
