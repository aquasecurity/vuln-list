    "Description": "Electron before 1.6.8 allows remote command execution because of a `nodeIntegration` bypass vulnerability. This also affects all applications that bundle Electron code equivalent to 1.6.8 or earlier. Bypassing the Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a precondition; however, recent Electron versions do not have strict SOP enforcement. Combining an SOP bypass with a privileged URL internally used by Electron, it was possible to execute native Node.js primitives in order to run OS commands on the user's host. Specifically, a `chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html` window could be used to eval a Node.js `child_process.execFile` API call.",
