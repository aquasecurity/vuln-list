    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA stored **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was identified in [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), specifically in the **Form Trigger** node's **HTML form element**. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML via an `\u003ciframe\u003e` with a `srcdoc` payload that includes arbitrary JavaScript execution. The attacker can also inject malicious Javascript by using `\u003cvideo\u003e` coupled `\u003csource\u003e` using an `onerror` event.\n\nWhile using `iframe` or a combination of `video` and `source` tag, this vulnerability allows for Account Takeover (ATO) by exfiltrating `n8n-browserId` and session cookies from authenticated users who visit a maliciously crafted form. Using these tokens and cookies, an attacker can impersonate the victim and change account details such as email addresses, enabling full control over the accountâ€”especially if 2FA is not enabled.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was addressed in [PR #16329](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/16329). Users should upgrade to version \u003e=1.98.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nApart from updating to the fixed version, n8n instance administrators can:\n- Configure a reverse proxy to **serve webhook requests from a different domain** [[docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/)].\n- Disable or restrict use of the **Form Trigger node**, particularly the **HTML** element type.\n- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to block execution of inline scripts and disallow use of `srcdoc`.\n\n### References\n- [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [MDN: iframe `srcdoc` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-srcdoc)\n- [HTML: `onerror` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#handler-onerror)",
