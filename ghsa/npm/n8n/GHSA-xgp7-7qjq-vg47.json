    "Description": "### Impact\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Git Node component available in both Cloud and Self-Hosted versions of n8n. When a malicious actor clones a remote repository containing a pre-commit hook, the subsequent use of the Commit operation in the Git Node can inadvertently trigger the hookâ€™s execution.\n\nThis allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the n8n environment, potentially compromising the system and any connected credentials or workflows.\n\nAll users with workflows that utilize the Git Node to clone untrusted repositories are affected.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability was addressed in v1.113.0 (n8n-io/n8n#19559), which introduces a new environment variable: `N8N_GIT_NODE_DISABLE_BARE_REPOS`. For self-hosted deployments, it is strongly recommended to set this variable to `true` to mitigate the risk of executing malicious Git hooks.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo reduce risk prior to upgrading:\n\n- Avoid cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.\n- Disable or restrict the use of the Git Node in workflows where repository content cannot be fully trusted.",
