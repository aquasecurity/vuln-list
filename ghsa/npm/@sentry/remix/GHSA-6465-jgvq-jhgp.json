    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen a Node.js application using the Sentry SDK has `sendDefaultPii: true` it is possible to inadvertently send certain sensitive HTTP headers, including the `Cookie` header, to Sentry. Those headers would be stored within the Sentry organization as part of the associated trace. A person with access to  the Sentry organization could then view and use these sensitive values to impersonate or escalate their privileges within a user's application. \n\nUsers may be impacted if:\n\n1. The Sentry SDK configuration has `sendDefaultPii` set to `true`\n2. The application uses one of the Node.js Sentry SDKs with version from `10.11.0` to `10.26.0` inclusively:\n- @sentry/astro\n- @sentry/aws-serverless\n- @sentry/bun\n- @sentry/google-cloud-serverless\n- @sentry/nestjs\n- @sentry/nextjs\n- @sentry/node\n- @sentry/node-core\n- @sentry/nuxt\n- @sentry/remix\n- @sentry/solidstart\n- @sentry/sveltekit\n\nUsers can check if their project was affected, by visiting Explore → Traces and searching for “http.request.header.authorization”, “http.request.header.cookie” or similar. Any potentially sensitive values will be specific to the users' applications and configurations.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in all Sentry JavaScript SDKs starting from the [10.27.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/10.27.0) version.\n\n### Workarounds\nSentry strongly encourages customers to upgrade the SDK to the latest available version, [10.27.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/10.27.0) or later.\nIf it is not possible, consider setting `sendDefaultPii: false` to avoid unintentionally sending sensitive headers. See [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/#step-2-configure) for documentation.\n\n### Resources\n* https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/expected-features/data-handling/#sensitive-data\n* https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/10.11.0\n* https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17475\n* https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/data-management/data-collected/#cookies",
