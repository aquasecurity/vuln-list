    "Description": "### Impact\nThe [ContextLines integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/contextlines/) uses readable streams to more efficiently use memory when reading files. The ContextLines integration is used to attach source context to outgoing events.\n\nThe stream was not explicitly closed after use. This could lead to excessive amounts of file handles open on the system and potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThe ContextLines integration is enabled by default in the Node SDK (`@sentry/node`) and SDKs that run in Node.js environments (`@sentry/astro`, `@sentry/aws-serverless`, `@sentry/bun`, `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless`, `@sentry/nestjs`, `@sentry/nextjs`, `@sentry/nuxt`, `@sentry/remix`, `@sentry/solidstart`, `@sentry/sveltekit`).\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to version `8.49.0` or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo remediate this issue in affected versions without upgrading to version `8.49.0` and above you can disable the ContextLines integration. See the [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/#removing-a-default-integration) for more details.\n\n```js\nSentry.init({\n  // ...\n  integrations: function (integrations) {\n    // integrations will be all default integrations\n    return integrations.filter(function (integration) {\n      return integration.name !== \"ContextLines\";\n    });\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIf you disable the ContextLines integration, you will lose source context on your error events.\n\n### References\n- Reported issue: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/14892\n- PR Fix: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/14997\n",
