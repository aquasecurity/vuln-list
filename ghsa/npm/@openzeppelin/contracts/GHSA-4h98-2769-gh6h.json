    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or `r, vs` as separate arguments.\n\nThe potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in 4.7.3.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or need assistance deploying a fix, email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com).\n",
