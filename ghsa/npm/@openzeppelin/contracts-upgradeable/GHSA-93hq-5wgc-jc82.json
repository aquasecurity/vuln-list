    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions` appear to respect the original intended calldata.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v4.8.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures` and `calldatas` parameters.\n",
