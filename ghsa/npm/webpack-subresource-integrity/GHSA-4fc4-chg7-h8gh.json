    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAll dynamically loaded chunks receive an invalid integrity hash that is ignored by the browser, and therefore the browser cannot validate their integrity. This removes the additional level of protection offered by SRI for such chunks. Top-level chunks are unaffected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched in version 1.5.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nN/A\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/issues/131\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Comment on [webpack-subresource-integrity issue #131](https://github.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/issues/131)\n* Or email us at [security@waysact.com](mailto:security@waysact.com)",
