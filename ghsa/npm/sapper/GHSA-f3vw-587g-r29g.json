    "Description": "Versions of `sapper` prior to 0.27.11 are vulnerable to Path Traversal. It is possible to access sensitive files on the server through HTTP requests containing URL-encoded `../`.  \n\nYou may test a `sapper` application running in prod mode with `curl -vvv http://localhost:3000/client/750af05c3a69ddc6073a/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/etc/passwd`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 0.27.11 or later.",
