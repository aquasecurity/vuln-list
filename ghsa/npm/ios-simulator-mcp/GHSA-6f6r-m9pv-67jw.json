    "Description": "# Command Injection in MCP Server\n\nThe MCP Server at https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/ is written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation.\n\n## Vulnerable tool\n\nThe MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input.\n\nLLM exposed user input for `duration`, `udid`, and `x` and `y` args can be replaced with shell meta-characters like `;` or `\u0026\u0026` or others to change the behavior from running the expected command `idb` to another command.\n\nVulnerable line of code: https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts#L166-L207\n\n```js\n  server.tool(\n    \"ui_tap\",\n    \"Tap on the screen in the iOS Simulator\",\n    {\n      duration: z.string().optional().describe(\"Press duration\"),\n      udid: z\n        .string()\n        .optional()\n        .describe(\"Udid of target, can also be set with the IDB_UDID env var\"),\n      x: z.number().describe(\"The x-coordinate\"),\n      y: z.number().describe(\"The x-coordinate\"),\n    },\n    async ({ duration, udid, x, y }) =\u003e {\n      try {\n        const actualUdid = await getBootedDeviceId(udid);\n        const durationArg = duration ? `--duration ${duration}` : \"\";\n        const { stderr } = await execAsync(\n          `idb ui tap --udid ${actualUdid} ${durationArg} ${x} ${y}  --json`\n        );\n\n```\n\n## Exploitation\n\nWhen LLMs are tricked through prompt injection (and other techniques and attack vectors) to call the tool with input that uses special shell characters such as `; rm -rf /tmp;#` and other payload variations, the full command-line text will be interepted by the shell and result in other commands except of `ps` executing on the host running the MCP Server.\n\nReference example from prior security research on this topic:\n\n![Cursor defined MCP Server vulnerable to command injection](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/f_auto,w_2560,q_auto/v1747081395/Screenshot_2025-05-07_at_9.22.11_AM_d76kvm.png)\n\n## Impact\n\nUser initiated and remote command injection on a running MCP Server.\n\n## References and Prior work\n\n1.
