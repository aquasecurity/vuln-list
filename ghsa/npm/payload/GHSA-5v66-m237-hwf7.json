    "Description": "Payload uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. After log out JWT is not invalidated, which allows an attacker who has stolen or intercepted token to freely reuse it until expiration date (which is by default set to 2 hours, but can be changed). \n\nThis issue has been fixed in version 3.44.0 of Payload.",
