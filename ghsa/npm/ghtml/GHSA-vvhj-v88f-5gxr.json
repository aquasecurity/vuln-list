    "Description": "## Summary\n\nIt is possible to introduce user-controlled JavaScript code and trigger a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in some cases.\n\n## Actions Taken\n\n- Updated the documentation to clarify that while `ghtml` escapes characters with special meaning in HTML, it does not provide comprehensive protection against all types of XSS attacks in every scenario. **_This aligns with the approach taken by other template engines. Developers should be cautious and take additional measures to sanitize user input and prevent potential vulnerabilities._** More reading: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\n- The backtick character (`) is now also escaped to prevent the creation of strings in most cases where a malicious actor somehow gains the ability to write JavaScript. This does not provide comprehensive protection either.",
