    "Description": "### Summary\nPKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of[ MCP framework](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp). However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.\n\n### Impact\nPKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.)\nThis bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.\n\n\n### Patches\nFixed in: https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27\n\nWe patched up the vulnerabilities in the latest version, v 0.0.5 of the Workers OAuth provider (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider). You'll need to update your MCP servers to use that version to resolve the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone",
