    "Description": "All versions of `smart-extend` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `deep()` function allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
