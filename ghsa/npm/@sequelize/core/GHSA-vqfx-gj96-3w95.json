    "Description": "### Impact\n\nProviding an invalid value to the `where` option of a query caused Sequelize to ignore that option instead of throwing an error. \n\nA finder call like the following did not throw an error:\n\n```ts\nUser.findAll({\n  where: new Date(),\n});\n```\n\nAs this option is typically used with plain javascript objects, be aware that this only happens at the top level of this option.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in [`sequelize@6.28.1`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15699) \u0026 [`@sequelize/core@7.0.0.alpha-20`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15375)\n\n### References\n\nA discussion thread about this issue is open at https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/discussions/15698\n\nCVE:  CVE-2023-22579\nSnyk: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SEQUELIZE-3324090",
