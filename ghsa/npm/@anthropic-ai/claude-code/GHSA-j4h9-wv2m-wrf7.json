    "Description": "At startup, Claude Code constructed a shell command that interpolated the value of `git config user.email` from the current workspace. If an attacker controlled the repositoryâ€™s Git config (e.g., via a malicious `.git/config`) and set `user.email` to a crafted payload, the unescaped interpolation could trigger arbitrary command execution **before** the user accepted the workspace-trust dialog. The issue affects versions prior to `1.0.105`. The fix in `1.0.105` avoids executing commands built from untrusted configuration and properly validates/escapes inputs.\n\n*   **Patches:** Update to `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` `1.0.105` or later.\n*   **Workarounds:** Open only trusted workspaces and inspect repository `.git/config` before launch; avoid inheriting untrusted Git configuration values.\n\n\u003e Thank you to the NVIDIA AI Red Team for reporting this issue!",
