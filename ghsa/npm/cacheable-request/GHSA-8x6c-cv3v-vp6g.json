This affects versions of the package http-cache-semantics before 4.1.1. The issue can be exploited via malicious request header values sent to a server, when that server reads the cache policy from the request using this library.\n\n### Details\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rc47-6667-2j5j\n\n",
