    "Description": "Versions of `grpc-ts-health-check` prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The package exposes an API endpoint that may allow attackers to set the service's health status to failing. This can lead to Denial of Service as Kubernetes blocks traffic to services with a failing status.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.0.0 or later.",
