    "Description": "Affected versions of `xtalk` are vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to the filesystem by placing \"../\" in the URL.\n\n**Example request:**\n```http\nGET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:localhost\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability, and the package has not been updated since 2014.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, and using a different, functionally equivalent package.",
