    "Description": "Versions of `bootstrap-vue` prior to 2.0.0-rc.12 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Due to insufficient input sanitization, components may be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting through the `options` variable. This may lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript on the user's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.0.0-rc.12 or later.",
