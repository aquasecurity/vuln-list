    "Description": "### Impact\nIf you used the [apiPrefilter](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_entity.html#apiprefilter) option of the `@Entity` decorator, by setting it to a function that returns a filter that prevents unauthorized access to data, an attacker who knows the `id` of an entity instance she is not authorized to access, can gain read, update and delete access to it.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in version 0.20.6\n\n### Workarounds\nSet the `apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function.\n\n### References\nIf you're using a minor version \u003c 0.20 and require a patch, please create an issue.",
