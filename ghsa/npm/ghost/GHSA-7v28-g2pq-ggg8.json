    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA [vulnerability](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24785) in an upstream library means an authenticated attacker can abuse locale input to execute arbitrary commands from a file that has previously been uploaded using the file upload functionality in the post editor.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 5.2.3, all 5.x sites should update as soon as possible.\nFixed in 4.48.2, all 4.x sites should update as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPatched versions of Ghost add validation to the locale input to prevent execution of arbitrary files. Updating Ghost is the quickest complete solution.\n\nAs a workaround, if for any reason you cannot update your Ghost instance, you can block the `POST /ghost/api/admin/settings/` endpoint, which will also disable updating settings for your site.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@ghost.org](mailto:security@ghost.org)\n\n### Credits\n\n* devx00 - https://twitter.com/devx00",
