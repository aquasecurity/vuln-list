    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn Dynamoose versions 2.0.0-2.6.0 there was a prototype pollution vulnerability in the internal utility method [`lib/utils/object/set.ts`](https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose/blob/master/lib/utils/object/set.ts). This method is used throughout the codebase for various operations throughout Dynamoose.\n\nWe have not seen any evidence of this vulnerability being exploited.\n\nWe do not believe this issue impacts v1.x.x since this method was added as part of the v2 rewrite. This vulnerability also impacts v2.x.x beta/alpha versions.\n\n### Patches\n\nv2.7.0 includes a patch for this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe are unaware of any workarounds to patch this vulnerability other than upgrading to v2.7.0 or greater.\n\n### References\n\n- Patch commit hash: 324c62b4709204955931a187362f8999805b1d8e\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Contact me](https://charlie.fish/contact)\n* [Read our Security Policy](https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\n\n### Credit\n\n- GitHub CodeQL Code Scanning",
