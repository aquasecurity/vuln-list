    "Description": "Affected versions of `hubl-server` insecurely download dependencies over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the responses and replace the dependencies with malicious ones, resulting in code execution on the system running `hubl-server`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability, and it has not seen any updates since 2015.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised yo",
