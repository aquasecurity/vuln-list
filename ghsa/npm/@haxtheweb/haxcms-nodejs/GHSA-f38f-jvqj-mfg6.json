    "Description": "### Summary\nThe NodeJS version of HAX CMS uses an insecure default configuration designed for local\ndevelopment. The default configuration does not perform authorization or authentication checks.\n\n### Details\nIf a user were to deploy haxcms-nodejs without modifying the default settings, ‘HAXCMS_DISABLE_JWT_CHECKS‘ would be set to ‘true‘ and their deployment would lack session authentication. \n\n![insecure-default-configuration-code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af58b08a-8a26-4ef5-8deb-e6e9d4efefaa)\n\n#### Affected Resources\n- [package.json:13](https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/blob/a4d2f18341ff63ad2d97c35f9fc21af8b965248b/package.json#L13)\n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this vulnerability, [install](https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs) HAX CMS NodeJS. The application will load without JWT checks enabled. \n\n### Impact\nWithout security checks in place, an unauthenticated remote attacker could access, modify, and delete all site information.",
