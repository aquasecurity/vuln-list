    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nIf you're running a vulnerable application on your computer and an attacker can trick you into visiting a malicious website, they could use [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) and [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks to read/write to vulnerable applications. \n\n**There is no evidence that suggests that this has been used in the wild.**\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, 2.15.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nNo.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nNo.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [fraction/oasis](http://github.com/fraction/oasis)\n* Email me at [christianbundy@fraction.io](mailto:christianbundy@fraction.io)",
