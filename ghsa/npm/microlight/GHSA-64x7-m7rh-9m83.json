    "Description": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because a website owner has to set CSS color values. The proof of concept doesn't demonstrate how a malicious user who is not the website owner can cause an application crash. This link has been maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA null pointer dereference vulnerability was discovered in microlight.js (version 0.0.7), a lightweight syntax highlighting library. When processing elements with non-standard CSS color values, the library fails to validate the result of a regular expression match before accessing its properties, leading to an uncaught TypeError and potential application crash.",
