    "Description": "### Summary\n\nDefault configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `\u003cKeyInfo /\u003e` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks.\n\n### Details\n\nAffected `xml-crypto` versions between versions `\u003e= 4.0.0` and `\u003c 6.0.0`. \n\n`xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `\u003cKeyInfo /\u003e`.\n\n`xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `\u003cKeyInfo /\u003e` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.\n\nAttacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `\u003cKeyInfo /\u003e` element.\n\nVulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` at\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca\n\nChanges at PR provided default method to extract certificate from signed XML document.\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/blob/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca/lib/signed-xml.js#L405-L414\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/blob/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca/lib/signed-xml.js#L334\n\nand changes at PR prefer output of that method to be used as certificate for signature verification even in the case when library is configured to use specific/pre-configured `signingCert`\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/blob/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca/lib/signed-xml.js#L507\n\nName of the `signingCert` was changed later (but prior to `4.0.0` release) to `publicCert`:\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/78329fbae34c9b25ba25882604e960f506d7c0e7\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/blob/78329fbae34c9b25ba25882604e960f506d7c0e7/lib/signed-xml.js#L507\n\nIssue was fixed to `6.0.0` by disabling implicit usage of default `getCertFromKeyInfo` implementation:\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445\n* https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000\n\nPossible workarounds for versions 4.x and 5.x:\n- Check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation.\n- Set `xml-crypto`'s `getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() =\u003e undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.\n\n### PoC\n\nhttps://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/discussions/399\n\n### Impact\n\nAn untrusted certificate can be used to pass a malicious XML payload through an improperly configured installation of `xml-crypto`.\n",
