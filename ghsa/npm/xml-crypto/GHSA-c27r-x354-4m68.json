    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can inject an HMAC-SHA1 signature that is valid using only knowledge of the RSA public key. This allows bypassing signature validation.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 2.0.0 has the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe recommendation is to upgrade. In case that is not possible remove the 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-sha1' entry from SignedXml.SignatureAlgorithms.",
