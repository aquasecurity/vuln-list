    "Description": "An XSS issue was reported in the MCP Inspector local development tool when connecting to an untrusted remote MCP server with a malicious redirect URI. This could be leveraged to interact directly with the inspector proxy to trigger arbitrary command execution. Users are advised to update to 0.16.6 to resolve this issue.\n\nThank you to the following researchers for their reports and contributions: \n* Raymond (Veria Labs)\n* Gavin Zhong, [superboyzjc@gmail.com](mailto:superboyzjc@gmail.com) \u0026 Shuyang Wang, [swang@obsidiansecurity.com](mailto:swang@obsidiansecurity.com).",
