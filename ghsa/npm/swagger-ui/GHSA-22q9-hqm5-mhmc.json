    "Description": "Versions of `swagger-ui` prior to 2.2.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to encode output in GET requests. The request is meant to respond with Content-Type `application/json` which does not trigger the vulnerability but if the web server changes the header to `text/html` it may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.2.1 or later.",
