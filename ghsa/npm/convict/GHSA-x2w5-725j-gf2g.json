    "Description": "### Impact\n\n* An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components\n* An attacker can override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.\n\nThe main use case of Convict is for handling server-side configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem is patched in `convict@6.2.3`. Users should upgrade to `convict@6.2.3`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading\n\n### References\n\n* https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-convict/\n* #384\n* 3b86be087d8f14681a9c889d45da7fe3ad9cd880\n* 1ea0ab19c5208f66509e1c43b0d0f21c1fd29b75\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory: \nadd your question as a comment in #384 \n",
