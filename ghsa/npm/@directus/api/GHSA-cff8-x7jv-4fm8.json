    "Description": "### Summary\nUnauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include `redirect` query string.\n\nFor example:\n- Project is configured with OpenID or OAuth2\n- Project is configured with cache enabled\n- User tries to login via SSO link, but without `redirect` query string\n- After successful login, credentials are cached\n- If an unauthenticated user tries to login via SSO link, it will return the credentials of the other last user\n\nThe SSO link is something like `https://directus.example.com/auth/login/openid/callback`, where `openid` is the name of the OpenID provider configured in Directus\n\n### Details\nThis happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the `respond` middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials.\nFor OpenID, this can be seen here:\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/auth/drivers/openid.ts#L453-L459\nAnd for OAuth2 can be seen here\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/auth/drivers/oauth2.ts#L422-L428\n\n### PoC\n- Create a new Directus project\n- Set `CACHE_ENABLED` to true\n- Set `CACHE_STORE` to `redis` for reliable results (if using memory with multiple nodes, it may only happen sometimes, due to cache being different for different nodes)\n- Configure `REDIS` with redis string or redis host, port, user, etc.\n- Set `AUTH_PROVIDERS` to `openid`\n- Set `PUBLIC_URL` to the the main URL of your project . \tFor example, `PUBLIC_URL: http://localhost:8055`\n- Configure `AUTH_OPENID_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH_OPENID_ISSUER_URL` with proper OpenID configurations\n- Be sure that on OpenID external app you have configured Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8055/auth/login/openid/callback`\n- Run Directus\n- Open the SSO link like `http://localhost:8055/auth/login/openid/callback`\n- Do the authentication on the OpenID external webpage\n- Verify that it you got redirected to a page with a JSON including `access_token` property\n- Be sure all anonymous mode windows are closed\n- Open an anonymous window and go to the SSO Link `http://localhost:8055/auth/login/openid/callback` and see you have the same credentials, even though you don't have any session because you are in anonymous mode\n\n### Impact\nAll projects using OpenID or OAuth 2, that does not include `redirect` query string on loggin in users.",
