    "Description": "### Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it does not describe a vulnerability in Bun itself. See the following rejection message from the CVE Numbering Authority:\n\n\u003e Rejected reason: Bun Shell does not invoke /bin/sh, or any other interpreter, for template literals created with the $ function. Each ${â€¦} interpolation is treated as a single argument. The security responsibility for this usage pattern lies with the calling application, which must ensure the sanitization and validation of any untrusted arguments before passing them to the executed commands. Therefore, the potential for command injection is not a flaw within Bun itself; rather, it is an argument injection that is contingent on its implementation by the consuming application.\n\n### Original Description\nVersions of the package bun after 0.0.12 are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in the $ shell API due to improper neutralization of user input. An attacker can exploit this by providing specially crafted input that includes command-line arguments or shell metacharacters, leading to unintended command execution. \n\n**Note:** This issue relates to the widely known and actively developed 'Bun' JavaScript runtime. The bun package on NPM at versions 0.0.12 and below belongs to a different and older project that happened to claim the 'bun' name in the past.",
