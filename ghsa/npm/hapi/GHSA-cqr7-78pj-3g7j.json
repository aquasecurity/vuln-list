    "Description": "Versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x of hapi are vulnerable to a denial of service attack via a file descriptor leak. \n\nWhen triggered repeatedly, this leak will cause the server to run out of file descriptors and the node process to die. The effort required to take down a server depends on the process file descriptor limit. No other side effects or exploits have been identified.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- Please upgrade to version 2.2.x or above as soon as possible.",
