    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIf a remote attacker was able to control the `pretty` option of the pug compiler, e.g. if you spread a user provided object such as the query parameters of a request into the pug template inputs, it was possible for them to achieve remote code execution on the node.js backend.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to `pug@3.0.1` or `pug-code-gen@3.0.2` or `pug-code-gen@2.0.3`, which correctly sanitise the parameter.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf there is no way for un-trusted input to be passed to pug as the `pretty` option, e.g. if you compile templates in advance before applying user input to them, you do not need to upgrade.\n\n### References\n\n\nOriginal report: https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/3312\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you believe you have found other vulnerabilities, please **DO NOT** open an issue. Instead, you can follow the instructions in our [Security Policy](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/master/SECURITY.md)",
