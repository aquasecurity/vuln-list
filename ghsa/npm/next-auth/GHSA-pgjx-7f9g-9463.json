    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, \u003ca href=\"http://attacker.com\"\u003eBefore signing in, claim your money!\u003c/a\u003e`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used:\n\nnext-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. See our [migration guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4))\n\nnext-auth v4 users before version 4.8.0 are impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe've released patches for this vulnerability in:\n  \n- v3 - `3.29.8`\n- v4 - `4.9.0`\n\nYou can do:\n\n```sh\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n# or\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n#\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change  `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it. Check out https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#customizing-emails\n\n### References\n\n\nRelated documentation:\n\n- https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#customizing-emails\n- https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4\n\nA test case has been added so this kind of issue will be checked before publishing.
