    "Description": "## Withdrawn\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a test.\n\n## Original Description\n\n### Impact\nUsers can include their own images for accessories via provided URLs. These URLs are not validated and can result in execution of injected code.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2 of octocat.js\n\n### Workarounds\nDirectly exposing rendered images to a website can introduce the vulnerability to users. To avoid, writing an image to disk then using that image in an image element in HTML mitigates the risk.\n\n### References\nTo render the file correctly, see documentation at `readme.md`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the octo.js repository](http://github.com/octocademy/octocat.js/issues)\n",
