    "Description": "Versions of `terriajs-server`prior to 2.7.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). If an attacker has access to a server whitelisted by the terriajs-server proxy or if the attacker is able to modify the DNS records of a domain whitelisted by the terriajs-server proxy, the attacker can use the terriajs-server proxy to access any HTTP-accessible resources that are accessible to the server, including private resources in the hosting environment.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.7.4 or later.",
