    "Description": "All versions of `bleach` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. It is possible to bypass the package's HTML sanitization with payloads such as `\"\u003c\u003cscript\u003e\u003c\u003c/script\u003escript\u003ealert('xss');\u003c/\u003cscript\u003e\u003c\u003c/script\u003escript\u003e\"` regardless of the passed options. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
