    "Description": "### Summary\n﻿\nA command echoing feature in the framework allows users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags. Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo \u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e` command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems.\n﻿\n### Details\n﻿\nThe framework provides a command `/echo` that causes the bot to repeat any user-provided message verbatim in the group chat. However, the bot fails to sanitize or filter platform-specific control elements such as `\u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e`, which, when included in a message, mentions everyone (i.e., @全体成员). While normal users are forbidden from using this tag in normal chats, the bot, which has higher privileges, is allowed to do so.\n﻿\nSince the `/echo` command blindly echoes any content, a user can exploit this by sending:\n﻿\n```\n/echo \u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e\n```\n﻿\nThe bot will then send a message containing `\u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e`, causing the platform to interpret it as an @全体成员 command, effectively allowing an unauthorized user to @everyone via the bot.\n﻿\n### PoC\n﻿\n1. Set up a chatbot using the affected framework.\n2. Join the chat that includes the bot as a regular user with **no permission to use @全体成员**.\n3. Send the following message in the chat:\n﻿\n```\n/echo \u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e\n```\n4. The bot will respond by repeating the message, and the platform will interpret `\u003cqqbot-at-everyone /\u003e` as an @全体成员 mention.\n5. All the chat members receive a notification, despite the user lacking that permission.\n﻿\n﻿",
