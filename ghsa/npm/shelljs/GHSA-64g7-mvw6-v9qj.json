    "Description": "### Impact\nOutput from the synchronous version of `shell.exec()` may be visible to other users on the same system. You may be affected if you execute `shell.exec()` in multi-user Mac, Linux, or WSL environments, or if you execute `shell.exec()` as the root user.\n\nOther shelljs functions (including the asynchronous version of `shell.exec()`) are not impacted.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in shelljs 0.8.5\n\n### Workarounds\nRecommended action is to upgrade to 0.8.5.\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.dev/bounties/50996581-c08e-4eed-a90e-c0bac082679c/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Ask at https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs/issues/1058\n* Open an issue at https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs/issues/new\n",
