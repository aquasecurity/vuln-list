    "Description": "The package colors after 1.4.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) that was introduced through an infinite loop in the americanFlag module. Unfortunately this appears to have been a purposeful attempt by a maintainer of colors to make the package unusable, other maintainers' controls over this package appear to have been revoked in an attempt to prevent them from fixing the issue.
