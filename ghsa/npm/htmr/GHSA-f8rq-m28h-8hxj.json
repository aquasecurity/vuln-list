    "Description": "Versions of `htmr` prior to 0.8.7 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  The package uses `innerHTML` to unescape HTML entities. This may lead to [DOM-based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS) through HTML-encoded XSS payloads. This may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 0.8.7 or later.",
