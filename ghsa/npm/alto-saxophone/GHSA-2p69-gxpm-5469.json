    "Description": "Affected versions of `alto-saxophone` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `alto-saxophone`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 2.25.1 or later.",
