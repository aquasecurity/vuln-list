    "Description": "### Impact\nThe [`verifyVerifiablePresentation()`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit/blob/master/src/service/signers/verifiable-presentation-signer.ts#L97) method check the cryptographic integrity of the Verifiable Presentation, but it does not check if the [`credentialSubject.id`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit-models/blob/develop/src/model/verifiable-credential.ts#L150) DID matches the signer of the VP proof.\n\nThe **verifier** is impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nPatch will be available in version 0.2.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Compute the address out of the `verifiablePresentation.proof.n.verificationMethod` using `getAddressFromPubKey()` from `crypt-util@0.1.5` and match it with the `credentialSubject.id` address from the credential.\n\n### References\n[Github issue](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit/issues/14)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Discuss in the existing [issue](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit/issues/14)\n* [Contact me](https://github.com/rabomarnix)",
