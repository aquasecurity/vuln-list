    "Description": "An issue was discovered in xdLocalStorage through 2.0.5. The `postData()` function in `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` specifies the wildcard (`*`) as the targetOrigin when calling the `postMessage()` function on the parent object. Therefore any domain can load the application hosting the \"magical iframe\" and receive the messages that the \"magical iframe\" sends.",
