    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA Parse Pointer can be used to access internal Parse Server classes. It can also be used to circumvent the `beforeFind` query trigger which can be an additional vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify an incoming query.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by implementing a patch in the internal query pipeline to prevent a Parse Pointer to be used to access internal Parse Server classes or circumvent the `beforeFind` trigger.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround to prevent a Parse Pointer to be used to access internal Parse Server classes. A workaround if a `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer is to instead use the Parse Server provided [security layers](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security) to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control.\n\n### References\n\n- GitHub security advisory: https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-fcv6-fg5r-jm9q\n- Patched in Parse Server 6.x: https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/6.2.2\n- Patched in Parse Server 5.x (LTS): https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/5.5.5",
