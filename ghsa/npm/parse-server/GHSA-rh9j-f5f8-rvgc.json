    "Description": "### Impact\nThe certificate in Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object.\n\n### Patches\nTo prevent this, a new `rootCertificateUrl` property is introduced to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the [current root certificate](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=stttq465) as of May 27, 2022.\n\nKeep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time (expected to be announced by Apple) and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rh9j-f5f8-rvgc\n- https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=stttq465\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server\n\n### More information\n* For questions or comments about this vulnerability visit our [community forum](http://community.parseplatform.org) or [community chat](http://chat.parseplatform.org)\n* Report other vulnerabilities at [report.parseplatform.org](https://report.parseplatform.org)\n\n",
