    "Description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability is an **Environment Variable Injection** issue in `dotenv.stringify`, affecting `google/zx`  version **8.3.1**.\n\nAn attacker with control over environment variable values can inject unintended environment variables into `process.env`. This can lead to **arbitrary command execution** or **unexpected behavior** in applications that rely on environment variables for security-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted input and pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been **patched** in version **8.3.2**. Users should **immediately upgrade** to this version to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not feasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by **sanitizing user-controlled environment variable values** before passing them to `dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid using `\"`, `'`, and backticks in values, or enforce strict validation of environment variables before usage.\n\n### References\n- [Issue Report](https://github.com/google/zx/issues/)\n- [Security Policy](https://github.com/google/zx/security/policy)\n- [Google Vulnerability Disclosure](https://g.co/vulnz)\n- [Patch](https://github.com/google/zx/pull/1094)",
