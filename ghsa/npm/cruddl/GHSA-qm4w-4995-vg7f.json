    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIf a vunerable version of cruddl is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB.\n\nSchemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected.\n\nThe attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas before they can update cruddl.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [cruddl](https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl)\n* Email us at [security@aeb.com](mailto:security@aeb.com)\n",
