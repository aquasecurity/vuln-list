    "Description": "All versions of the package check-branches are vulnerable to Command Injection.\n\ncheck-branches is a command-line tool that is interacted with locally, or via CI, to confirm no conflicts exist in git branches.\n\nHowever, the library follows these conventions which can be abused:\n1. It trusts branch names as they are (plain text)\n2. It spawns git commands by concatenating user input\n\nSince a branch name is potentially a user input - as users can create branches remotely via pull requests, or simply due to privileged access to a repository - it can effectively be abused to run any command.",
