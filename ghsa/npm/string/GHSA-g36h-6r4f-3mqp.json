    "Description": "Affected versions of `string` are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service when specifically crafted untrusted user input is passed into the `underscore` or `unescapeHTML` methods.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThere is currently no direct patch for this vulnerability. \n\nCurrently, the best solution is to avoid passing user input to the `underscore` and `unescapeHTML` methods.\n\nAlternatively, a user provided patch is available in [Pull Request #217]( https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/pull/217/commits/eab9511e4efbc8c521e18b6cf2e8565ae50c5a16), however this patch has not been tested, nor has it been merged by the package author.",
