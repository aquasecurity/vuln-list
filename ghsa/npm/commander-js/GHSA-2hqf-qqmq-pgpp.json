    "Description": "All versions of `commander-js` are considered malicious. The package is malware designed to take advantage of users making a mistake when typing the name of a module to install. When installed, the package downloads an arbitrary file and executes its contents as a post-install script.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package is not available on the npm Registry anymore. If you happen to find this package in your environment you should consider the system it was installed on compromised and assess if further response (such as rotating all credentials found on the compromised machine) is necessary.\n",
