    "Description": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the [lunary npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunary) is connected to https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary-js, not the https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary repo that is discussed in this advisory.\n\n**The underlying vulnerability report is still valid**, but it doesn't affect a product in a [GitHub Advisory Database supported ecosystem](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-the-github-advisory-database#github-reviewed-advisories).\n\nThis link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nAn information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run.",
