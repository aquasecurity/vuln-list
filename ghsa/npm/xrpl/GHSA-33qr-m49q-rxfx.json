    "Description": "### Impact\nVersions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. If you are using one of these versions, stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems.\n\nVersion 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3.\n\n### Required Actions\nTo secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys:\n\nThe XRP Ledger supports key rotation: https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/how-tos/manage-account-settings/assign-a-regular-key-pair\n\nIf any account's master key is potentially compromised, you should disable it: https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/how-tos/manage-account-settings/disable-master-key-pair\n\n### References\nhttps://www.aikido.dev/blog/xrp-supplychain-attack-official-npm-package-infected-with-crypto-stealing-backdoor",
