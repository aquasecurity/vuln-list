    "Description": "Affected versions of `herbivore` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `herbivore`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe module author has rewritten much of the package, and in that process, patched the vulnerability, but has not published any of the new code to npm.  \n\nIn order to get an updated version, it is necessary to install the package from github. This can be done using the following command:\n```\nnpm i samatt/herbivore\n```",
