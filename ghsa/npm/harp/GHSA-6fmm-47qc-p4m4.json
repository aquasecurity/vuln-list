    "Description": "All versions of `harp` are vulnerable to Unauthorized File Access. If a symlink in the project's base directory points to a file outside of the directory, the file is served. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the server.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
