    "Description": "The `@diez/generation` npm package is a client for Diez. The locateFont method of @diez/generation has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the @diez/generation library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. All versions of this package are vulnerable as of the writing of this CVE.",
