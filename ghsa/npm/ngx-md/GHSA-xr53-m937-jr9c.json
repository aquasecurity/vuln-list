Links are not properly restricted to http/https and can contain JavaScript which may lead to arbitrary code execution. Markdown input such as `[Click Me](javascript:alert('Injected!'%29)` is rendered as a `Click Me` link that executes JavaScript.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 6.0.3 or later.",
