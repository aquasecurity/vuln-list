    "Description": "Today we are releasing Grafana 8.2.3. This patch release includes an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 8.0.0-beta1.\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.\n\n## CVE-2021-41174 XSS vulnerability on unauthenticated pages\n\n### Summary\n\nCVSS Score: 6.9 Medium\nCVSS:[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:N/MI:H/MA:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:N/MI:H/MA:L)\n\nWe received a security report to security@grafana.com on 2021-10-21 about a vulnerability in Grafana regarding the XSS vulnerability.\n\nIt was later identified as affecting Grafana versions from 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.2.2. [CVE-2021-41174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41174) has been assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser.\n\nThe user visiting the malicious link must be unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu bar.\n\nThere are two ways an unauthenticated user can open a page in Grafana that contains the login button:\n- Anonymous authentication is enabled. This means all pages in Grafana would be open for the attack.\n- The link is to an unauthenticated page. The following pages are vulnerable:\n  - `/dashboard-solo/snapshot/*`\n  - `/dashboard/snapshot/*`\n  - `/invite/:code`\n\nThe url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }} \n\nAn example of an expression would be: `{{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}`. This can be included in the link URL like this: \n\nhttps://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor('alert(1)')()%7D%7D?orgId=1\n\nWhen the user follows the link and the page renders, the login button will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression contained in the URL.\n\n### Attack audit\n\nWe can not guarantee that the below will identify all attacks, so if you find something using the audit process described below, you should consider doing a full assessment.\n\n#### Through reverse proxy/load balancer logs\n\nTo determine if your Grafana installation has been exploited for this vulnerability, search through your reverse proxy/load balancer access logs for instances where the path contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code. For example, this could be code that attempts to show a fake login page or to steal browser or session data. The [OWASP cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html) has several examples of XSS attacks.\n\n#### Through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature\n\nIf you enabled “Log web requests” in your configuration with `router_logging = true`, look for requests where `path` contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code.\n\n### Patched versions\n\nRelease 8.2.3:\n\n- [Download Grafana 8.2.3](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.2.3)\n- [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-2-3/)\n\n### Solutions and mitigations\n\nDownload and install the appropriate patch for your version of Grafana.\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched, and [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.\n\n### Workaround\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string `{{` in the path.\n\nExample of an Nginx rule to block the literal string `{{`:\n\n```\nlocation ~ \\{\\{ {\n    deny all;\n}\n```\n### Timeline and postmortem\n\nHere is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. All times in UTC. \n\n* 2021-10-21 23:13: Security researcher sends the initial report about an XSS vulnerability.\n* 2021-10-21 23:13: Confirmed to be reproducible in at least versions 8.0.5 and 8.2.2.\n* 2021-10-22 02:02 MEDIUM severity declared.\n* 2021-10-22 09:22: it is discovered that Grafana instances with anonymous auth turned on are vulnerable. This includes https://play.grafana.org/ .\n* 2021-10-22 09:50: Anonymous access disabled for all instances on Grafana Cloud as a mitigation measure.\n* 2021-10-22 11:15: Workaround deployed on Grafana Cloud that blocks malicious requests.\n* 2021-10-22 12:35: Enabled anonymous access for instances on Grafana Cloud. \n* 2021-10-22 12:51: All instances protected by the workaround. From this point forward, Grafana Cloud is no longer affected.\n* 2021-10-22 14:05 Grafana Cloud instances updated with a fix.\n* 2021-10-22 19:23 :Determination that no weekend work is needed as the issue is of MEDIUM severity and the root cause has been identified.\n* 2021-10-25 14:13: Audit of Grafana Cloud concluded, no evidence of exploitation.\n* 2021-10-27 12:00: Grafana Enterprise images released to customers under embargo.\n* 2021-11-03 12:00: Public release.\n\n## Reporting security issues\n\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to [security@grafana.com](mailto:security@grafana.com).
