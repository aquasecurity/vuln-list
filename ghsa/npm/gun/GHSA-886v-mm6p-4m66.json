    "Description": "## Urgent Upgrade\n\nThe static file server module included with GUN had a **serious vulnerability**:\n\n - Using `curl --path-as-is` allowed reads on any parent directory or files.\n\nThis did not work via the browser or via curl without as-is option.\n\n ### Fixed\n\nThis has been fixed since version `0.2019.416` and higher.\n\n ### Who Was Effected?\n\nMost NodeJS users who use the default setup, such as:\n\n - `npm start`\n - `node examples/http.js`\n - `Heroku` 1-click-deploy\n - `Docker`\n - `Now`\n\nIf you have a custom NodeJS code then you are probably safe *unless* you have something like `require('http').createServer(Gun.serve(__dirname))` in it.\n\nIf you have not upgraded, it is **mandatory** or else it is highly likely your environment variables and AWS (or other) keys could be leaked.\n\n ### Credit\n\nIt was reported and fixed by [JK0N](https://github.com/amark/gun/pull/527), but I did not understand the `--path-as-is` condition.\n\nJoonas Loppi from [function61](http://function61.com) rediscovered it and explained the urgency to me to fix it.\n",
