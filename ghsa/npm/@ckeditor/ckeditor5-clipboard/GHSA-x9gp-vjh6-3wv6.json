    "Description": "### Impact\nA Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration.\n\nThis vulnerability affects **only** installations where the editor configuration meets one of the following criteria:\n- [HTML embed plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html/html-embed.html) is enabled\n- Custom plugin introducing editable element which implements view [`RawElement`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_rawelement-ViewRawElement.html) is enabled\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been recognized and patched. The fix will be available in version 46.0.3 (and above), and explicitly in version 45.2.2.\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@cksource.com](mailto:security@cksource.com) if you have any questions or comments about this advisory.",
