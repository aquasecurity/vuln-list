    "Description": "All versions of `marsdb` are vulnerable to Command Injection. In the `DocumentMatcher` class, selectors on `$where` clauses are passed to a Function constructor unsanitized. This allows attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system when the function is executed.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
