    "Description": "All versions of `markdown-it-katex` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to properly escape error messages, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser by triggering an error.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
