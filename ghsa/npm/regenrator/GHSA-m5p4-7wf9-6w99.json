    "Description": "All versions of `regenrator` are considered malicious. The package is malware designed to take advantage of users making a mistake when typing the name of a module to install. When executed, the package calls home to a Command and Control server to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package was published to the npm Registry for a very short period of time. If you happen to find it in your environment you should revoke and rotate all credentials  found on the compromised machine, as well as completely erase the affected machine and reinstall your Operating System.",
