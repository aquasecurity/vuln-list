    "Description": "All version of `jquery-mobile` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The package checks for content in `location.hash` and if a URL is found it does an XmlHttpRequest (XHR) to the URL and renders the response with `innerHTML`. It fails to validate the `Content-Type` of the response, allowing attackers to include malicious payloads as part of query parameters that are reflected back to the user. A response such as `{\"q\":\"\u003ciframe/src='javascript:alert(1)'\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\",\"results\":[]}` would be parsed as HTML and the JavaScript payload executed.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
