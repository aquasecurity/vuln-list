    "Description": "### Summary\nThere exists a command injection vulnerability in `npmcli/git` versions \u003c2.0.8 which may result in arbitrary shell command execution due to improper argument sanitization when `npmcli/git` is used to execute Git commands based on user controlled input. \n\nThe impact of this issue is possible Arbitrary Command Injection when `npmcli/git` is run with untrusted (user controlled) Git command arguments. \n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary Command Injection\n\n### Details\n\n`npmcli/git` prior to release `2.0.8` passed user controlled input as arguments to a shell command without properly sanitizing this input. Passing unsanitized input to a shell can lead to arbitrary command injection. For example passing `git+https://github.com/npm/git; echo hello world` would trigger the shell execution of `echo hello world`.  \n\nThis issue was remediated by no longer running `npmcli/git` git commands through an intermediate shell.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in release `2.0.8`\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis report was reported to us by @tyage (Ierae Security) through the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).\n",
