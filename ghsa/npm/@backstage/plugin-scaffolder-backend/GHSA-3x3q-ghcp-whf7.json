    "Description": "### Impact\nDuplicate logging of the input values in the `fetch:template` action in the Scaffolder meant that some of the secrets were not properly redacted. If you're not passing through `${{ secrets.x }}` to `fetch:template` there is no impact.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been resolved in `2.1.1` of the `scaffolder-backend` plugin.\n\n### Workarounds\nTemplate Authors can remove the use of `${{ secrets }}` being used as an argument to `fetch:template`.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\nVisit our Discord, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)",
