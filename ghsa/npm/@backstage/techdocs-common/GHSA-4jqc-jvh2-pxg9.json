    "Description": "### Impact\nA malicious actor with the ability to register entities in the Software Catalog is able to write files to arbitrary paths on the techdocs backend host instance when `techdocs.publisher.type` is set to `local`.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the Software Catalog must be configured with non-standard field format validators and/or non-standard entity policies.\n\n### Patches\nThose affected are advised to upgrade to `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` version `1.1.2` or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf patching or upgrading is not possible, it would be sufficient to update any custom Catalog field format validators and/or custom entity policies to disallow entity names, kinds, and namespaces containing `..`\n\n\u003c!--\n### References\ntodo: Link to blog post / published report.\n--\u003e\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n- Visit our chat, linked to in the [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)",
