If a payload with a large number of null bytes (`%00`) is provided by an attacker it can crash ecstatic by running it out of memory.\n\n\n[Results from the original advisory](https://www.checkmarx.com/advisories/denial-of-service-dos-vulnerability-in-ecstatic-npm-package/)\n\n```\nA payload of 22kB caused a lag of 1 second,\nA payload of 35kB caused a lag of 3 seconds,\nA payload of 86kB caused the server to crash\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 2.0.0 or later.",
