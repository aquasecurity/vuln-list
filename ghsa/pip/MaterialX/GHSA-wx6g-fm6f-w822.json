    "Description": "### Summary\n\nWhen parsing an MTLX file with multiple nested `nodegraph` implementations, the MaterialX XML parsing logic can potentially crash due to stack exhaustion.\n\n### Details\n\nBy specification, multiple kinds of elements in MTLX support nesting other elements, such as in the case of `nodegraph` elements. Parsing these subtrees is implemented via recursion, and since there is no max depth imposed on the XML document, this can lead to a stack overflow when the library parses an MTLX file with an excessively high number of nested elements.\n\n### PoC\n\nPlease download the `recursion_overflow.mtlx` file from the following link: \n\nhttps://github.com/ShielderSec/poc/tree/main/CVE-2025-53009\n\n`build/bin/MaterialXView --material recursion_overflow.mtlx`\n\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker could intentionally crash a target program that uses MaterialX by sending a malicious MTLX file.",
