    "Description": "### Impact\nTensorFlow's Grappler optimizer has a [use of unitialized variable](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3457a2b122e50b4d44ceaaed5a663d635e5c22df/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/auto_parallel.cc#L155-L164):\n\n```cc\n  const NodeDef* dequeue_node;\n  for (const auto\u0026 train_node : train_nodes) {\n    if (IsDequeueOp(*train_node)) {\n      dequeue_node = train_node;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (dequeue_node) {\n    ...\n  }\n```\n\nIf the `train_nodes` vector (obtained from the saved model that gets optimized) does not contain a `Dequeue` node, then `dequeue_node` is left unitialized.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Qian Feng from Baidu Security Team.\n",
