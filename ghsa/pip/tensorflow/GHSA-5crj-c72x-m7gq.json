    "Description": "### Impact\nThe [process of building the control flow graph](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/immutable_executor_state.cc#L284-L346) for a TensorFlow model is vulnerable to a null pointer exception when nodes that should be paired are not:\n  \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \n@tf.function\ndef func():\n  return tf.raw_ops.Exit(data=[False,False])\n    \nfunc()\n```\n\nThis occurs because the code assumes that the first node in the pairing (e.g., an `Enter` node) always exists when encountering the second node (e.g., an `Exit` node):\n  \n```cc\n  ...\n} else if (IsExit(curr_node)) {\n  // Exit to the parent frame.\n  parent = parent_nodes[curr_id];         \n  frame_name = cf_info-\u003eframe_names[parent-\u003eid()];\n  ...                \n```\n\nWhen this is not the case, `parent` is `nullptr` so dereferencing it causes a crash.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [05cbebd3c6bb8f517a158b0155debb8df79017ff](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/05cbebd3c6bb8f517a158b0155debb8df79017ff).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",
