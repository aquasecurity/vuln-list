    "Description": "### Impact\nThe `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`:\n\n```\n  library {\n    function {\n      signature {\n        name: \"SomeOp\"\n        description: \"Self recursive op\"\n      }\n      node_def {\n        name: \"1\"\n        op: \"SomeOp\"\n      }\n      node_def {\n        name: \"2\"\n        op: \"SomeOp\"\n      }\n    }\n  } \n```\n\nThis would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.",
