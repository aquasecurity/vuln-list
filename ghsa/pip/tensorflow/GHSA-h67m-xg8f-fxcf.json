    "Description": "### Impact\nThe [code behind `tf.function` API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/python/eager/def_function.py#L542) can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive:\n\n```python \nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function()               \ndef fun1(num):\n    if num == 1:\n        return\n    print(num)\n    fun2(num-1)\n\n@tf.function()\ndef fun2(num):\n    if num == 0:\n        return\n    print(num)\n    fun1(num-1)\n\nfun1(9)\n```\n\nThis occurs due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object.\n\nLoading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent scenario.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [afac8158d43691661ad083f6dd9e56f327c1dcb7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/afac8158d43691661ad083f6dd9e56f327c1dcb7).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",
