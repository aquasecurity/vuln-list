    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service:\n\nThis is caused by the MLIR optimization of `L2NormalizeReduceAxis` operator. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/lite/transforms/optimize.cc#L67-L70) unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking that the vector has elements:\n\n```cc\nbool L2NormalizeReduceAxis(Value sq_op, DenseElementsAttr axis) {\n  if (sq_op.getType().cast\u003cShapedType\u003e().getRank() - 1 ==\n          *axis.getValues\u003cint\u003e().begin() ||\n      *axis.getValues\u003cint\u003e().begin() == -1) {\n      // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [d6b57f461b39fd1aa8c1b870f1b974aac3554955](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d6b57f461b39fd1aa8c1b870f1b974aac3554955).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n          \n### Attribution              \nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.",
