    "Description": "### Summary\nImproper validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP request (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request if the attacker controls the HTTP method.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability occurs only if the attacker can control the HTTP method (GET, POST etc.) of the request.\n\nPrevious releases performed no validation on the provided value. If an attacker controls the HTTP method it will be used as is and can lead to HTTP request smuggling.\n\n### PoC\nA minimal example can be found here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/jnovikov/7f411ae9fe6a9a7804cf162a3bdbb44b\n\n### Impact\nIf the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request it will be able to modify the request (request smuggling).\n\n### Workaround\nIf unable to upgrade and using user-provided values for the request method, perform manual validation of the user value (e.g. by restricting it to a few known values like GET, POST etc.).",
