    "Description": "### Summary\nImproper validation make it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP request (e.g. to insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request if the attacker controls the HTTP version.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability only occurs if the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request (including its type).\nFor example if an unvalidated JSON value is used as a version and the attacker is then able to pass an array as the `version` parameter.\nFurthermore, the vulnerability only occurs when the `Connection` header is passed to the `headers` parameter.\n\nAt this point, the library will use the parsed value to create the request. If a list is passed, then it bypasses validation and it is possible to perform CRLF injection.\n\n### PoC\nThe POC below shows an example of providing an unvalidated array as a version:\nhttps://gist.github.com/jnovikov/184afb593d9c2114d77f508e0ccd508e\n\n### Impact\nCRLF injection leading to Request Smuggling.\n\n### Workaround\nIf these specific conditions are met and you are unable to upgrade, then validate the user input to the `version` parameter to ensure it is a `str`.\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/7835/files",
