    "Description": "### Summary\nSession cookie is without Secure and HTTPOnly flags.\n\n### Details\nPlease take a look at this part of code (PoC screenshot) or check code directly (provided in Occurrences section below)\n\n**Occurrences**:\nhttps://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/blob/develop/frontend/taipy-gui/src/components/Taipy/Navigate.tsx#L67\n\n**Proposed remediation:** add Secure and HTTPOnly flags for cookies.\n\nIt could be like this:\ndocument.cookie = `tprh=${tprh};path=/;Secure;HttpOnly;`;\n\n\n### PoC\n**Screenshot**:\n![image](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/assets/18367606/ea7d1bbd-ba27-447f-932b-3d33ffc1a2e7)\n\n\n### Impact\n**Secure**: This flag indicates that the cookie should only be sent over secure HTTPS connections. Without this flag, the cookie will be sent over both HTTP and HTTPS connections, which could expose it to interception or tampering if the connection is not secure.\n**HttpOnly:** This flag prevents the cookie from being accessed by client-side JavaScript. It helps mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), by preventing malicious scripts from accessing the cookie's value.\n\n**References**\n    CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/614.html\n    CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1004.html\n    OWASP - Secure Cookie Attribute - https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/SecureCookieAttribute\n    Cookie security flags - https://www.invicti.com/learn/cookie-security-flags/\n    Cookie lack Secure flag - https://support.detectify.com/support/solutions/articles/48001048982-cookie-lack-secure-flag\n\n**Other**:\nTitle: Encrypting the Web\nURL: https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web\n\nUpdate (Required advisory information) - added severity, resource: \nhttps://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00500200_tls-cookie-without-secure-flag-set\n\nBest regards,",
