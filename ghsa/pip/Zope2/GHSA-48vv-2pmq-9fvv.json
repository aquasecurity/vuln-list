    "Description": "Zope before 2.13.19, as used in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1, does not reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the value via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2012-5508 due to different vulnerability types (ADT2).",
