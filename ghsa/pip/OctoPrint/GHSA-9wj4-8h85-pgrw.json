    "Description": "### Impact\n\nOctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.1 contain a vulnerability that allows any unauthenticated attacker to send a manipulated broken `multipart/form-data` request to OctoPrint and through that make the web server component become unresponsive. This could be used to effectively run a denial of service attack on the OctoPrint server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 1.11.2.\n\n### Workaround\n\nOctoPrint administrators are once more reminded to not make OctoPrint available on hostile networks (e.g. the internet), regardless of whether this vulnerability is patched or not.\n\n### Details\n\nThe issue can be triggered by a broken `multipart/form-data` request lacking an end boundary to any of OctoPrint's endpoints implemented through the `octoprint.server.util.tornado.UploadStorageFallbackHandler` request handler. The request handler will get stuck in an endless busy loop, looking for a part of the request that will never come. As Tornado is single-threaded, that will effectively block the whole web server.\n\nThe fix adds detection of invalid requests like that and ensures they are handled gracefully with an HTTP 400 Bad Request response.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.",
