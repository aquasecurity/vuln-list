    "Description": "Apache Airflow, versions before 2.6.3, is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to perform unauthorized file access outside the intended directory structure by manipulating the run_id parameter. This vulnerability is considered low since it requires an authenticated user to exploit it. It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected",
