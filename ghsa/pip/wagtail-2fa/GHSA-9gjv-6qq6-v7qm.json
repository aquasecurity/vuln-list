    "Description": "### Impact\nAny user with access to the CMS can view and delete other users\u0026#39; 2FA devices by going to the correct path. The user does not require special permissions in order to do so. By deleting the other user\u0026#39;s device they can disable the target user\u0026#39;s 2FA devices and potentially compromise the account if they figure out their password.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in version 1.4.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github.com/labd/wagtail-2fa](https://github.com/labd/wagtail-2fa)\n* Email us at [security@labdigital.nl](mailto:security@labdigital.nl)",
