    "Description": "### Impact\nThe use of Python's marshal module to handle unchecked input in a public method on `PortalFolder` objects can lead to an unauthenticated denial of service and crash situation. The code in question is exposed by all portal software built on top of `Products.CMFCore`, such as Plone. All deployments are vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThe code has been fixed in `Products.CMFCore` version 3.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can make the affected `decodeFolderFilter` method unreachable by editing the `PortalFolder.py` module in `Products.CMFCore` by hand and then restarting Zope. Go to line 233 of `PortalFolder.py` and remove both the `@security.public` decorator for `decodeFolderFilter` as well as the method's entire docstring. This is safe because the method is not actually used by current code.\n\n### References\n- Products.CMFCore security advisory [GHSA-4hpj-8rhv-9x87](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.CMFCore/security/advisories/GHSA-4hpj-8rhv-9x87)\n\n### Credits\nThanks go to Nicolas VERDIER from onepoint.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in the [Products.CMFCore issue tracker](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.CMFCore/issues)\n- Email us at [security@plone.org](mailto:security@plone.org)",
