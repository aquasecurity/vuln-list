    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker could modify the locators.ini locator file with python code that without proper validation it's executed and it could lead to rce. The vulnerability is in the function def __locator__(self, locator_name: str) in page.py. The vulnerable code that load and execute directly from the file without validation it's:\n```python\n return eval(self._bot.locator(self._page_name, locator_name))\n```\n\n### Patches\nIn order to mitigate this issue it's important to upgrade to fastbots version 0.1.5 or above. \n\n### References\n[Merge that fix also this issue](https://github.com/ubertidavide/fastbots/pull/3#issue-2003080806)",
