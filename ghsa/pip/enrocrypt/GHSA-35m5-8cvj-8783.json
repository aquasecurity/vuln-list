    "Description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability is we used MD5 hashing Algorithm In our hashing file. If anyone who is a beginner(and doesn't know about hashes)  can face problems as MD5 is considered a Insecure Hashing Algorithm. \n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability is patched in v1.1.4 of the product, the users can upgrade to version 1.1.4.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf u specifically want a version and don't want to upgrade, you can remove the `MD5` hashing function from the file `hashing.py` and this vulnerability will be gone\n\n### References\nhttps://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/cwe/916/\nhttps://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/cwe/327/\nhttps://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/cwe/328/\nhttps://www.section.io/engineering-education/what-is-md5/\nhttps://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/01/24/reversing-an-md5-hash/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [**Enrocrypt's Official Repo**](http://www.github.com/Morgan-Phoenix/EnroCrypt)\n* Create a Discussion in  [**Enrocrypt's Official Repo**](http://www.github.com/Morgan-Phoenix/EnroCrypt)\n",
