    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests.\n\nThere is no evidence that the issue was exploited on https://sentry.io. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens via `https://your-self-hosted-sentry-installation/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/`.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was fixed in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/53850 and is available in the release 23.7.2 of [sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.7.2) and [self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.7.2).\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds.",
