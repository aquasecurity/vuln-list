    "Description": "### Impact\nAssigning existing users to a different organization is currently possible. It may lead to unintended access: if a user from organization A is accidentally assigned to organization B, they will retain their permissions and therefore might be able to access stuff they should not be allowed to access.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to 3.8.0\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n### References\nNone\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [vantage6@iknl.nl](mailto:vantage6@iknl.nl)\n",
