    "Description": "### Impact\nSince version 61.0, there's a vulnerability which allows attaching content of arbitrary files and URLs to a generated PDF document, even if `url_fetcher` is configured to prevent access to files and URLs.\n\n### Patches\nFixed by 734ee8e thatâ€™s included in 61.2\n\n### Workarounds\n- Check that no PDF attachment is defined in source HTML.\n- Launch WeasyPrint in a sandbox that prevents access to the filesystem and the network.\n\n",
