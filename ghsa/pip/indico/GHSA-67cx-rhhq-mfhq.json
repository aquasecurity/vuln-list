    "Description": "## Local file disclosure through LaTeX injection\n\n### Impact\nAn external audit of the Indico codebase has discovered a vulnerability in Indico's LaTeX sanitization code, which could have malicious users to run unsafe LaTeX commands on the server. Such commands allowed for example to read local files (e.g. `indico.conf`).\n\nAs far as we know it is not possible to write files or execute code using this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nYou need to update to [Indico 2.2.3](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.2.3) as soon as possible.\nWe also released [Indico 2.1.10](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.1.10) in case you cannot update to 2.2 for some reason.\nSee https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/ for instructions on how to update.\n\n### Workarounds\nSetting `XELATEX_PATH = None` in `indico.conf` will result in an error when building a PDF, but without being able to run xelatex, the vulnerability cannot be abused.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a thread in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/)\n* Email us privately at [indico-team@cern.ch](mailto:indico-team@cern.ch)\n\n",
