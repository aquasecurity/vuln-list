    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to a memory usage of up to 1 GB per stream. This requires parsing the content stream of a page using the LZWDecode filter.\n\nThis is a follow up to [GHSA-jfx9-29x2-rv3j](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-jfx9-29x2-rv3j) to align the default limit with the one for *zlib*.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in [pypdf==6.4.0](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.4.0).\n\n### Workarounds\nIf users cannot upgrade yet, use the line below to overwrite the default in their code:\n\n```python\npypdf.filters.LZW_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH = 75_000_000\n```",
