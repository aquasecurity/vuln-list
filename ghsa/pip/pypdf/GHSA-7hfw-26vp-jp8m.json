    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to the RAM being exhausted. This requires just reading the file if a series of FlateDecode filters is used on a malicious cross-reference stream. Other content streams are affected on explicit access.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in [pypdf==6.0.0](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.0.0).\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade yet, you might want to implement the workaround for `pypdf.filters.decompress` yourself: https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/0dd57738bbdcdb63f0fb43d8a6b3d222b6946595/pypdf/filters.py#L72-L143\n\n### References\nThis issue has been reported in #3429 and fixed in #3430.",
