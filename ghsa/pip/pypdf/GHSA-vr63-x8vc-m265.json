    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This requires parsing the content stream of a page which has an inline image using the DCTDecode filter.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in [pypdf==6.1.3](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.1.3).\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade yet, consider applying the changes from PR [#3501](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/3501).",
