    "Description": "When matrix-nio before 0.20 requests a room key from our devices, it correctly accepts key forwards only if they are a response to a previous request. However, it doesn't check that the device that responded matches the device the key was requested from.\n\nThis allows a malicious homeserver to insert room keys of questionable validity into the key store in some situations, potentially assisting in an impersonation attack.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [poljar@termina.org.uk](mailto:poljar@termina.org.uk).",
