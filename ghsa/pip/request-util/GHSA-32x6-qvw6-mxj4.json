    "Description": "### Impact\n\nUsing `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.\n\n### References\n\n- This vulnerability was discovered after the announcement of similar vulnerabilities in the `follow-redirects` package. There is more information there: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74fj-2j2h-c42q and https://huntr.dev/bounties/7cf2bf90-52da-4d59-8028-a73b132de0db/\n- Fixed in 125e4474f910c1507f8ec3232848626fbc0f55c4 and 0c99bc511533d48be17dc6bfe641f7d0aeb34d77\n ",
