    "Description": "**Affected Versions:** \u003e 0.2.0 and \u003c 1.0.0 \n**Patched Versions:** \u003e= 1.0.0\n\n**Description:**\nThe library stored confidential information, including API keys, in a local SQLite database without encryption. This behavior was not clearly documented outside of the database architecture page. Users were not given the ability to configure the database location. As a result, anyone with access to the container or host filesystem could retrieve sensitive data in plaintext by accessing the `.db` file.\n\n**Impact:**\nUnauthorized access to API keys and other confidential data if the SQLite database file was exposed.\n\n**Fixed in Version 1.0.0:**\n- Database is fully encrypted\n- Database location is configurable  \n- API keys can be set via environment variables (this capability existed in earlier versions)",
