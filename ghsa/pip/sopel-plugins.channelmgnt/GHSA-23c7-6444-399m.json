    "Description": "### Impact\nOn some IRC servers, restrictions around the removal of the bot using the kick/kickban command could be bypassed when kicking multiple users at once.\nWe also believe it may have been possible to remove users from other channels but due to the wonder that is IRC and following RfCs, We have no POC for that.\n\nFreenode is not affected.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to 2.0.1 or higher\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use this plugin on networks where TARGMAX \u003e 1.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue on [phab](https://phab.mirahezebots.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/).\n* Email us at [staff(at)mirahezebots(dot)org](mailto:staff@mirahezebots.org)",
