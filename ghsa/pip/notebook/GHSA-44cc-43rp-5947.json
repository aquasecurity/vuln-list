    "Description": "### Impact\nUsers of JupyterLab who click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running an older `jupyter-server` version.\n\n### Patches\nJupyterLab 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 were patched.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workaround has been identified, however users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a redirect vulnerability fix.\n\n### References\n\nVulnerability reported by user @davwwwx via the [bug bounty program](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/jupyter/jupyter/detail) [sponsored by the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/news/european-commissions-open-source-programme-office-starts-bug-bounties-2022-01-19_en) and hosted on the [Intigriti platform](https://www.intigriti.com/).\n",
