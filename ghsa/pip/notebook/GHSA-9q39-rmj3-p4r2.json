    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown cells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature.\n\nA malicious user can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user.\n\n### Patches\n\nJupyterLab v3.6.8, v4.2.5 and Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2 were patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for the underlying DOM Clobbering susceptibility. However, select plugins can be disabled on deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk. These are:\n- `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to preview mathematical equations \n- `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to open Markdown previews\n- `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older version of the mathjax plugin for JupyterLab 4.x\n\nTo disable these extensions run:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin\njupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin\njupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin\n```\n\nTo confirm that the plugins were disabled run:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n### References\n\nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nThis change has a potential to break rendering of some markdown. There is a setting in Sanitizer which allows to revert to the previous sanitizer settings (`allowNamedProperties`).",
