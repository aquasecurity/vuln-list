    "Description": "### Summary\n\nBinding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nWhile doing some static analysis and code inspection, I found the following code binding a socket to `INADDR_ANY` by passing `\"\"` as the address. This effectively binds to any network interface on the local system, not just localhost (127.0.0.1). \n\n### Details\n\nAs stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `\"0.0.0.0\"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `\"::\"`. \n\nhttps://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/task/docs/serve.py#L23C38-L23C39\n\nThe text around this code also imply the intention is to host docs only on localhost.\n\n### PoC\n\nTo recreate, run the docs ServeTask.run() to stand up the HTTP server.  Then run `netstat` to see what addresses this process is bound.\n\n### Impact\n\nA user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network.\n\nFurther references:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket-families\nhttps://docs.securesauce.dev/rules/PY030\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1327.html\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has has been mitigated in [dbt-core v1.6.15](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.6.15), [dbt-core v1.7.15](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.7.15), and [dbt-core v1.8.1](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.8.1) by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve` (https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/10209).\n",
