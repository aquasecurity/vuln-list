    "Description": "### Impact\nThis is a kind of moderate issue. The impact is not big for normal users but can be for users who want to secure their code/files/etc.\n\nThe issue is that the map of encoding/decoding languages are visible in code. \n\n### Patches\nThe Problem was patched in 0.2.5, so you should try to upgrade to the 0.2.5 version.\n\n### For 0.2.5 version users\nPlease run the post_install.py file inside the Scripts folder after downloading from pip.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is a fix to this problem but it requires modifying the code. Modifying the code can lead to more issues.\n\n### References\nThere are currently no references to this problem.\n\n### NOTE: If you get a error regarding a function like -\u003e get_key() or something like that, please re-run the file post_install.py inside Scripts folder\n",
