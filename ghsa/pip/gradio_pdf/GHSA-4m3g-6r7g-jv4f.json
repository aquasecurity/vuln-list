    "Description": "### Summary\ngradio-pdf projects with dependencies on the pdf.js library are vulnerable to CVE-2024-4367, which allows arbitrary JavaScript execution.\n\n### PoC\n1. Generate a pdf file with a malicious script in the fontmatrix. (This will run `alert(‘XSS’)`.)\n[poc.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15516798/poc.pdf)\n\n2. Run the app. In this PoC, I've used the demo for a simple proof.\n![1](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-pdf/assets/114328108/d1bb7626-3d0f-4984-8873-297658d6e77e)\n\n3. Upload a PDF file containing the script.\n![2](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-pdf/assets/114328108/803d8080-c946-446e-bb34-cf5640e1b4de)\n\n4. Check that the script is running.\n![3](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-pdf/assets/114328108/4956b95f-acca-4bb1-a3c2-7dfc96adf890)\n\n\n### Impact\nMalicious scripts can be injected into the code, and when linked with vulnerabilities such as CSRF, it can cause even greater damage. In particular, It can become a source of further attacks, especially when linked to social engineering.\n\n### Mitigation\nUpgrade the pdf.js to v4.2.67, which removes the vulnerability. (or set the option `isEvalSupported` to `false`.)\n\n### Reference\n1. https://codeanlabs.com/blog/research/cve-2024-4367-arbitrary-js-execution-in-pdf-js/\n2. https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/18015",
