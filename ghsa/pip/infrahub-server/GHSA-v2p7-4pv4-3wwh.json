    "Description": "### Impact\nA bug in the authentication logic will cause API tokens that were deleted and/or expired to be considered valid. This means that any API token that is associated with an active user account can authenticate successfully.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed in versions `1.3.9` and `1.4.5`\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can delete or deactivate the account associated with a deleted API token to prevent that token from authenticating.",
