    "Description": "### Impact\nUsing a specially crafted file, a user could potentially upload a file containing code that when executed could send arbitrary requests to the server. If that file was opened by an administrator, it could lead to escalation of privileges of the original submitter or other malicious actions. Users must have been registered to the site to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.7 and 2.11.2\n\n### Workarounds\nOn versions prior to CKAN 2.10.7 and 2.11.2, site maintainers can restrict the file types supported for uploading using the [ckan.upload.user.mimetypes](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-user-mimetypes) / [ckan.upload.user.types](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-user-types) and [ckan.upload.group.mimetypes](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-group-mimetypes) / [ckan.upload.group.types](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-group-types) config options.\nTo entirely disable file uploads you can use:\n\n```ini\nckan.upload.user.types = none\n```",
