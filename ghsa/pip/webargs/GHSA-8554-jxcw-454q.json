    "Description": "An issue was discovered in webargs before 5.1.3, as used with marshmallow and other products. JSON parsing uses a short-lived cache to store the parsed JSON body. This cache is not thread-safe, meaning that incorrect JSON payloads could have been parsed for concurrent requests.",
