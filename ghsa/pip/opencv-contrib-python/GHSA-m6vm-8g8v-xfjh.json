    "Description": "An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data structure persistence functionality of OpenCV 4.1.0 (corresponds with OpenCV-Python 4.1.0.25). A specially crafted XML file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple heap corruptions and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability.",
