    "Description": "### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen using `file:\u003clocation\u003e` command and `\u003clocation\u003e` is web URL location (http, https). mangadex-downloader will try to open and read a file in local disk if the content from online file is exist-as-a-file in victim computer\r\n\r\nSo far, the app only read the files and not execute it. But still, when someone reading your files without you knowing, it's very scary.\r\n\r\n### Proof of Concept (PoC)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mansuf.link/unauthorized-file-read-in-mangadex-downloader-cve-2022-36082/\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no workarounds to make it safe from this issue. But i suggest you double check the url before proceed to download or update to latest version ( \u003e= 1.7.2)\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nFixed in version 1.7.2.\r\nCommit patch: https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/commit/439cc2825198ebc12b3310c95c39a8c7710c9b42",
