    "Description": "### Impact\n\nSydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to disk space exhaustion and denial of service.\n\nSydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.\n\nThis affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched by 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRequest sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy.\n\nThere are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@matrix.org.",
