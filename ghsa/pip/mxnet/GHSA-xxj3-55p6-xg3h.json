    "Description": "A regular expression used in Apache MXNet (incubating) is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service by excessive resource consumption. The bug could be exploited when loading a model in Apache MXNet that has a specially crafted operator name that would cause the regular expression evaluation to use excessive resources to attempt a match. This issue affects Apache MXNet versions prior to 1.9.1.",
