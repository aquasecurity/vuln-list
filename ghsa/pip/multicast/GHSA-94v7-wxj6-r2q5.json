    "Description": "### Impact\n * Some source-builds may be impacted by a CWE-1395 (eg. vulnerable `setuptools` dependency).\n   * Multicast prior to v2.0.9a3 on systems with minimal dependancies installed may use `setuptools \u003c78.1.1` and thus rely on a compromised dependency. In some cases there is a chance that source-builds would fail due to an exploit of the closely related CVE-2025-47273, or become arbitrarily modified.\n\n### Patches\n * Pre-release version v2.0.9a0 and later resolve the issue by bumping requirements to `setuptools\u003e=80.4`\n   * Pre-release version v2.0.9a3 and later are recommended for improved stability over v2.0.9a0\n\n### Workarounds\n * Further hardening in v2.0.9a4+ of the build process in CI builds allowing source builds to be verified via GH attestations.\n\n### References\n* [GHSA-5rjg-fvgr-3xxf](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/security/advisories/GHSA-5rjg-fvgr-3xxf)\n* pypa/setuptools#4946\n\n### Fixes\n* https://github.com/reactive-firewall/multicast/blob/c5c7c7de272421d944beca8452871bca6bfd151f/tests/requirements.txt#L32\n* https://github.com/reactive-firewall/multicast/blob/c5c7c7de272421d944beca8452871bca6bfd151f/docs/requirements.txt#L27\n* https://github.com/reactive-firewall/multicast/blob/c5c7c7de272421d944beca8452871bca6bfd151f/requirements.txt#L26\n* https://github.com/reactive-firewall/multicast/blob/c5c7c7de272421d944beca8452871bca6bfd151f/pyproject.toml#L2",
