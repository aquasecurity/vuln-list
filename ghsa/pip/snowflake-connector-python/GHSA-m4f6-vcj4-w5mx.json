    "Description": "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake Connector for Python. The OCSP response cache uses pickle as the serialization format, potentially leading to local privilege escalation.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 2.7.12 through 3.13.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.13.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nThe OCSP response cache is saved locally on the machine running the Connector using the pickle serialization format. This can potentially lead to local privilege escalation if an attacker has write access to the OCSP response cache file.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.13.1 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.13.1.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team).",
