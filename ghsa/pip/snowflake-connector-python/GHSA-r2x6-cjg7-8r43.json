    "Description": "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake Connector for Python. On Linux systems, when temporary credential caching is enabled, the Snowflake Connector for Python will cache temporary credentials locally in a world-readable file.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 2.3.7 through 3.13.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.13.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nOn Linux, when either EXTERNALBROWSER or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods are used with temporary credential caching enabled, the Snowflake Connector for Python will cache the temporary credentials in a local file. In the vulnerable versions of the Driver, this file is created with world-readable permissions.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.13.1 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.13.1.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.
