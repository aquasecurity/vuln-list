    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe initial vulnerability identified in Streamlit apps using custom components, allowing for directory traversal attacks, was addressed in version 1.11.1. However, a minor issue persisted, which could still potentially expose certain files on the server file-system under specific conditions.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe released an update in version 1.30.0 to further tighten security measures. Users are strongly advised to update to version 1.30.0 immediately for optimal security.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo additional workarounds are necessary once the update to version 1.30.0 is applied.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@streamlit.io](mailto:security@streamlit.io)",
