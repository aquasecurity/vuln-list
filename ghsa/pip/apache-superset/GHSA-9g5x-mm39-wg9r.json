    "Description": "When a guest user accesses a chart in Apache Superset, the API response from the /chart/data endpoint includes a query field in its payload. This field contains the underlying query, which improperly discloses database schema information, such as table names, to the low-privileged guest user.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.3.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.3, which fixes the issue.",
