    "Description": "Apache Superset contains an improper access control vulnerability in its /explore endpoint. A missing authorization check allows an authenticated user to discover metadata about datasources they do not have permission to access. By iterating through the datasource_id in the URL, an attacker can enumerate and confirm the existence and names of protected datasources, leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0, which fixes the issue.",
