    "Description": "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio\u003e4.44` to mitigate this issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nTo mitigate the risk before applying the patch, developers can manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a **constant-time comparison** function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes. Alternatively, access to the analytics dashboard can be disabled.",
