    "Description": "### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors could exploit this race condition.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio\u003e=5` to address this issue.",
