    "Description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows users of Gradio applications that have a public link (such as on Hugging Face Spaces) to access files on the machine hosting the Gradio application. This involves intercepting and modifying the network requests made by the Gradio app to the server. \n\n### Patches\nYes, the problem has been patched in Gradio version 4.19.2 or higher. We have no knowledge of this exploit being used against users of Gradio applications, but we encourage all users to upgrade to Gradio 4.19.2 or higher.\n\nFixed in: https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/16fbe9cd0cffa9f2a824a0165beb43446114eec7\nCVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1728",
