    "Description": "### Impact\nThis CVE covers the ability of 3rd party websites to access routes and upload files to users running Gradio applications locally.  For example, the malicious owners of [www.dontvisitme.com](http://www.dontvisitme.com/) could put a script on their website that uploads a large file to http://localhost:7860/upload and anyone who visits their website and has a Gradio app will now have that large file uploaded on their computer\n\n### Patches\nYes, the problem has been patched in Gradio version 4.19.2 or higher. We have no knowledge of this exploit being used against users of Gradio applications, but we encourage all users to upgrade to Gradio 4.19.2 or higher.\n\nFixed in: https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/84802ee6a4806c25287344dce581f9548a99834a\nCVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1727",
