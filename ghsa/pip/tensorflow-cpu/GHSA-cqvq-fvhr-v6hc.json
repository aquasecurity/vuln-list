    "Description": "### Impact\nAnother instance of CVE-2022-35935, where `SobolSample` is vulnerable to a denial of service via assumed scalar inputs, was found and fixed.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.SobolSample(dim=tf.constant([1,0]), num_results=tf.constant([1]), skip=tf.constant([1]))\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf) and [02400ea266bd811fc016a848445de1bbff3a23a0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/02400ea266bd811fc016a848445de1bbff3a23a0)\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick both commits on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. TensorFlow 2.7.4 will have the first commit cherrypicked.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by:\n- Kang Hong Jin from Singapore Management University\n- Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University\n- 刘力源, Information System \u0026 Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology\n- Pattarakrit Rattankul\n",
