    "Description": "### Impact\nThe [macros that TensorFlow uses for writing assertions (e.g., `CHECK_LT`, `CHECK_GT`, etc.)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/core/platform/default/logging.h) have an incorrect logic when comparing `size_t` and `int` values. Due to type conversion rules, several of the macros would trigger incorrectly.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b917181c29b50cb83399ba41f4d938dc369109a1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b917181c29b50cb83399ba41f4d938dc369109a1) (merging GitHub PR [#55730](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/55730)).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported externally via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/55530).",
