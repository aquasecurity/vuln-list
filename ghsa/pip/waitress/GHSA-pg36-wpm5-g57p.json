    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWaitress implemented a \u0026amp;quot;MAY\u0026amp;quot; part of the RFC7230 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n\n      Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n      the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n      terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n\nUnfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nContent-Length: 100[CRLF]\nX-Header: x[LF]Content-Length: 0[CRLF]\n```\n\nWould get treated by Waitress as if it were:\n\n```\nContent-Length: 100\nX-Header: x\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThis could potentially get used by attackers to split the HTTP request and smuggle a second request in the body of the first.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0. This brings a range of changes to harden Waitress against potential HTTP request confusions, and may change the behaviour of Waitress behind non-conformist proxies. \n\nWaitress no longer implements the MAY part of the specification and instead requires that all lines are terminated correctly with CRLF. If any lines are found with a bare CR or LF a 400 Bad Request is sent back to the requesting entity.\n\nThe Pylons Project recommends upgrading as soon as possible, while validating that the changes in Waitress don\u0026amp;#39;t cause any changes in behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nVarious reverse proxies may have protections against sending potentially bad HTTP requests to the backend, and or hardening against potential issues like this. If the reverse proxy doesn\u0026amp;#39;t use HTTP/1.1 for connecting to the backend issues are also somewhat mitigated, as HTTP pipelining does not exist in HTTP/1.0 and Waitress will close the connection after every single request (unless the Keep Alive header is explicitly sent... so this is not a fool proof security method)\n\n### Issues/more security issues:\n\n* open an issue at https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)",
