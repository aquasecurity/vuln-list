    "Description": "### Summary\n\nPaying invoices in Eclair that do not get settled within the internal timeout (about 30s) lead to a payment being considered failed, even though it may still be in flight.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `blocking: true` on the API call will lead to a timeout error if a payment does not get settled in the 30s timeout with the error: `Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://eclair-node/user/$l#134241942]] after [30000 ms]. Message of type [fr.acinq.eclair.payment.send.PaymentInitiator$SendPaymentToNode]. A typical reason for AskTimeoutException is that the recipient actor didn't send a reply.`\nhttps://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/c04c13b2f8cfbb625571a07dfddeb65ea6df8dac/lnbits/wallets/eclair.py#L138\n\nThis is considered a payment failure by parts of the code, and assumes the payment is not going to be settled after:\nhttps://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/c04c13b2f8cfbb625571a07dfddeb65ea6df8dac/lnbits/wallets/eclair.py#L144\nhttps://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/c04c13b2f8cfbb625571a07dfddeb65ea6df8dac/lnbits/wallets/eclair.py#L141\nhttps://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/c04c13b2f8cfbb625571a07dfddeb65ea6df8dac/lnbits/wallets/eclair.py#L146\n\nThe best way to fix this is to check the payment status after an error, and when not sure, always consider a payment still in flight.\n\n### PoC\n\nA very simple way to exploit this is:\n- Create a hold invoice\n- Pay the invoice with the LNbits server backed by an Eclair node, until it times out\n- Settle the hold invoice\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to a total loss of funds for the node backend.\n",
