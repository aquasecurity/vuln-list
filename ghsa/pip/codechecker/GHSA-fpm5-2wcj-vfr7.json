    "Description": "### Summary\nAuthentication method confusion allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service. The built-in root user is generated in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and has universal access. \n\n### Details\nUntil CodeChecker version 6.24.1 there was an auto-generated super-user account that could not be disabled.\nThe attacker needs to know only the username of the root user.\n\nThis root user is unconditionally assigned superuser permissions.\n\nWhich means that if any user via any service logs in with the root user's username, they will unconditionally have superuser permissions on the CodeChecker instance.\n\nThe name of the user name can be found in `root.user` file in the CodeChecker configuration directory.\nYou can check if you are impacted by checking the existence of this user in the external authentication services (e.g. LDAP, PAM etc.).\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker who can create an account on an enabled external authentication service, to log in as the root user, and access and control everything that can be controlled via the web interface.\nThe attacker needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful.",
