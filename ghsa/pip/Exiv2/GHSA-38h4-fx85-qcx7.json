    "Description": "### Impact\nA heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n\nNote that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug is fixed in version v0.28.5.\n\n### References\nIssue: https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/3168\nFix: https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3174\n\n### For more information\nPlease see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.",
