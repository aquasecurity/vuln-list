    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general?). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this *specific* Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case (`/extras/job-button/\u003cuuid\u003e/run/`) The effect is that a user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs.\n\n\u003e Not all Jobs can be configured as JobButtons; only those implemented as subclasses of `JobButtonReceiver` can be used in this way, so this vulnerability only applies specifically to `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses.\n\nAdditionally, although the documentation states that both `extras.run_job` permission and `extras.run_jobbutton` permission must be granted to a user in order to run Jobs via JobButton, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is not actually enforced by the view code, only by the UI by disabling the button from being clicked normally. Furthermore, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission never prevented invoking Jobs (including `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses) via the normal \"Job Run\" UI, so after some discussion, we've decided that the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is redundant, and as it never achieved its stated/documented purpose, the fixes below will remove the UI check for `extras.run_jobbutton` and all other references to the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission, rather than adding enforcement of this previously unenforced permission.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 (https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995) and 2.1.0 (https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993)\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nPartial mitigation can be achieved by auditing `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses defined in the system and restricting which users are permitted to create or edit JobButton records. \n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995\n",
