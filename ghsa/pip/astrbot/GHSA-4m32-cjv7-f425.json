    "Description": "### Summary\nAstrBot uses a hard-coded JWT signing key, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands by installing a malicious plugin.\n\n### Details\n\nAstrBot uses a [hard-coded JWT signing key](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/blob/v3.5.16/astrbot/core/__init__.py), which allows attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism. Once bypassed, the attacker can install a Python plugin that will be imported [here](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/blob/master/astrbot/dashboard/routes/plugin.py), enabling arbitrary command execution on the target host.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll publicly accessible AstrBot instances are vulnerable.\n\nFor more information, please see: [CVE-2025-55449-AstrBot-RCE](https://github.com/Marven11/CVE-2025-55449-AstrBot-RCE)\n\n### Patch\n\nThis vulnerability was first reported on **2025-06-21** and was patched on the **same day** (2025-06-21).\n\nThe vulnerability was publicly disclosed on **2025-11-14**. Prior to public disclosure, monitoring from AstrBot Cloud indicated that fewer than 2% of deployed instances were still running the affected version. Therefore, this disclosure is not expected to have a significant impact on existing active instances.",
