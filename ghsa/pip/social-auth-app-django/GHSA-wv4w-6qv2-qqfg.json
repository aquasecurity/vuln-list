    "Description": "### Impact\n\nUpon authentication, the user could be associated by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email` pipeline was not included. This could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication service does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique e-mail addresses.\n\n### Patches\n\n* https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/803\n\n### Workarounds\n\nReview the authentication service policy on e-mail addresses; many will not allow exploiting this vulnerability.",
