    "Description": "There is a heap buffer overflow when writing a sufficiently large (\u003e64k encoded with default settings) image in the DDS format due to writing into a buffer without checking for available space. \n\nThis only affects users who save untrusted data as a compressed DDS image. \n\n* Unclear how large the potential write could be. It is likely limited by process segfault, so it's not necessarily deterministic. It may be practically unbounded. \n* Unclear if there's a restriction on the bytes that could be emitted. It's likely that the only restriction is that the bytes would be emitted in chunks of 8 or 16. \n\nThis was introduced in Pillow 11.2.0 when the feature was added.",
