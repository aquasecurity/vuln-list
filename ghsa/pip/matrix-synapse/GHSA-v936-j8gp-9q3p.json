    "Description": "### Impact\nRequests to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and sending push notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible.\n\nFor the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.\n\n### Patches\nIssue is resolved by #8821. Further improvements to protect homeservers by default were made in #8870 and #8954.\n\n### Workarounds\nRequests to internal IP addresses could be blocked at the system or network level.",
