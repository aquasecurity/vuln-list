    "Description": "### Impact\nMissing input validation of some parameters on the endpoints used to confirm third-party identifiers could cause excessive use of disk space and memory leading to resource exhaustion.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed by #9321.\n\n### Workarounds\nDepending on the needs and configuration of the homeserver a few options are available:\n\n1. Using email as third-party identifiers be disabled by not configuring the `email` setting.\n2. Using phone numbers as third-party identifiers can be disabled by ensuring that `account_threepid_delegates.msisdn` is not configured.\n3. Additionally, the affected endpoint patterns can be blocked at a reverse proxy:\n\n    * `^/_matrix/client/(r0|unstable)/register/email`\n    * `^/_matrix/client/(r0|unstable)/register/msisdn`\n    * `^/_matrix/client/(r0|unstable)/account/password`\n    * `^/_matrix/client/(r0|unstable)/account/3pid`",
