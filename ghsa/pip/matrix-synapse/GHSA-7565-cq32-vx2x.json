    "Description": "### Impact\nUsers were able to forge read receipts for any event (if they knew the room ID and event ID). Note that the users were not able to view the events, but simply mark it as read. This could be confusing as clients will show the event as read by the user, even if they are not in the room.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16327\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround.\n",
