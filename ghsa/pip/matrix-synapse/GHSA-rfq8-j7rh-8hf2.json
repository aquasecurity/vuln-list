    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn Synapse before 1.120.1, `multipart/form-data` requests can in certain configurations transiently increase memory consumption beyond expected levels while processing the request, which can be used to amplify denial of service attacks.\n\n### Patches\n\nSynapse 1.120.1 resolves the issue by denying requests with unsupported `multipart/form-data` content type.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nLimiting request sizes or blocking the `multipart/form-data` content type before the requests reach Synapse, for example in a reverse proxy, alleviates the issue. Another approach that mitigates the attack is to use a low `max_upload_size` in Synapse.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/twisted/twisted/issues/4688#issuecomment-1167705518\n- https://github.com/twisted/twisted/issues/4688#issuecomment-2385711609\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security at element.io](mailto:security@element.io).\n",
