    "Description": "### Impact\n\nSynapse versions before 1.120.1 fail to properly validate invites received over federation. This vulnerability allows a malicious server to send a specially crafted invite that disrupts the invited user's `/sync` functionality.\n\n### Patches\n\nSynapse 1.120.1 rejects such invalid invites received over federation and restores the ability to sync for affected users.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nServer administrators can disable federation from untrusted servers.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security at element.io](mailto:security@element.io).\n",
