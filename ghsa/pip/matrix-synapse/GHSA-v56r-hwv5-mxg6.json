    "Description": "### Impact\nA malicious server can craft events with a `depth` outside the integer range allowed by Canonical JSON. When such an event is received by Synapse version up to 1.127.0, it prevents it from federating with other servers. The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in Synapse v1.127.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nClosed federation environments of trusted servers or non-federating installations are not affected.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security at element.io](mailto:security@element.io).",
