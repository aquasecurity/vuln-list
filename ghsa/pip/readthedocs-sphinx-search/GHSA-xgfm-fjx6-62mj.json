    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to include arbitrary HTML content in search results by having a user search a malicious project. This was due to our search client not correctly escaping all user content from search results. You can find more information in the [advisory published in our readthedocs.org repo](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/security/advisories/GHSA-qhqx-5j25-rv48).\n\nUsers of this extension should update to the 0.3.2 version, and trigger a new build.\n\nThis issue was discovered by a member of our team, and we have seen no signs that this vulnerability was exploited in the wild.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in our 0.3.2 version. \n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs-sphinx-search/commit/8c6f6d01e88e72ef32ed0c220b6c19d1e1121c73\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@readthedocs.org](mailto:security@readthedocs.org) ([PGP](https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/security.html#pgp-key))",
