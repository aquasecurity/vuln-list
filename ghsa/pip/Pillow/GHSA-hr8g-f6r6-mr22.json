    "Description": "When reading a TGA file with RLE packets that cross scan lines, Pillow reads the information past the end of the first line without deducting that from the length of the remaining file data. This vulnerability was introduced in Pillow 9.1.0, and can cause a heap buffer overflow.\n\nOpening an image with a zero or negative height has been found to bypass a decompression bomb check. This will now raise a SyntaxError instead, in turn raising a PIL.UnidentifiedImageError.",
