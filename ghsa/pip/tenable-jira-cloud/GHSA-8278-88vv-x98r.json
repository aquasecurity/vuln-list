    "Description": "### Impact\nIt is possible to run arbitrary commands through the yaml.load() method.  This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file.\n\n### Workarounds\nManually adjust yaml.load() to yaml.safe_load()\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [tenable/integration-jira-cloud](https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/issues)\n* Email us at [vulnreport@tenable.com](mailto:vulnreport@tenable.com)",
