    "Description": "If a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a streamable HTTP session, this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the server side, causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service. Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions, and presence of infrastructure-level resilience measures.\n\nThank you to Rich Harang for reporting this issue.",
