    "Description": "### Impact\nDNS rebinding vulnerability in Neo4j Cypher MCP server allows malicious websites to bypass Same-Origin Policy protections and execute unauthorised tool invocations against locally running Neo4j MCP instances.\u0026nbsp;The attack relies on the user being enticed to visit a malicious website and spend sufficient time there for DNS rebinding to succeed.\n\n### Patches\nCORS Middleware added to Cypher MCP server v0.4.0 that blocks all web-based access by default.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade to v0.4.0 and above, use stdio mode.\n\n### References\n[Vendor Advisory](https://neo4j.com/security/cve-2025-10193)\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10193 \n\nCredits\nWe want to publicly recognize the contribution of Evan Harris from [mcpsec.dev](https://mcpsec.dev/) for reporting this issue and following the responsible disclosure [policy](https://neo4j.com/trust-center/responsible-disclosure/).",
