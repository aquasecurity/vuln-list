    "Description": "### Impact\nSockeye uses YAML to store model and data configurations on disk.  Versions below 2.3.24 use unsafe YAML loading, which can be made to execute arbitrary code embedded in config files.\n\nAn attacker can add malicious code to the config file of a trained model and attempt to convince users to download and run it.  If users run the model, the embedded code will run locally.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in version 2.3.24 and above by #964.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [awslabs/sockeye](https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye)\n* Email us at [sockeye-dev](mailto:sockeye-dev@amazon.com)\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability was reported by Masatoshi Yoshizawa of yamory Security Team.",
