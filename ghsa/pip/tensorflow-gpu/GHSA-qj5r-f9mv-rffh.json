    "Description": "### Impact \nMultiple operations in TensorFlow can be used to trigger a denial of service via `CHECK`-fails (i.e., assertion failures). This is similar to [TFSA-2021-198](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md) (CVE-2021-41197) and has similar fixes.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the reported issues in multiple GitHub commits. It is possible that other similar instances exist in TensorFlow, we will issue fixes as these are discovered.\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.",
