    "Description": "### Impact\nWhile calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel, there is a conditional statement of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in overflows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.sparse.eye(num_rows=9223372036854775807, num_columns=None)\n```\n  \nSimilarly, `tf.range` would result in crashes due to overflows if the start or end point are too large.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.range(start=-1e+38, limit=1)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [6d94002a09711d297dbba90390d5482b76113899](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6d94002a09711d297dbba90390d5482b76113899) (merging [#51359](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51359)) and [1b0e0ec27e7895b9985076eab32445026ae5ca94](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1b0e0ec27e7895b9985076eab32445026ae5ca94) (merging [#51711](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51711)).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported externally via [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46912), [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46899) and [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46889).\n",
