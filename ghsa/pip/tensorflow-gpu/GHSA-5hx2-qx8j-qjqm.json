    "Description": "### Impact\nIf `tf.image.resize` is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\ntf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D(\n  size=1610637938,\n  data_format='channels_first',\n  interpolation='bilinear')(np.ones((5,1,1,1)))\n```\n\nThe number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the `int64_t` type and the overflow is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This aborts the process.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e5272d4204ff5b46136a1ef1204fc00597e21837](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e5272d4204ff5b46136a1ef1204fc00597e21837) (merging [#51497](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51497)).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported externally via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46914).",
