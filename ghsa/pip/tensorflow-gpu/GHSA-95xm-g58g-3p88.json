    "Description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape` can be made to trigger an integral division by 0 exception:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseReshape(\n  input_indices = np.ones((1,3)),\n  input_shape = np.array([1,1,0]),\n  new_shape = np.array([1,0]))\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/reshape_util.cc#L176-L181) calls the reshaping functor whenever there is at least an index in the input but does not check that shape of the input or the target shape have both a non-zero number of elements.\n\nThe [reshape functor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/reshape_util.cc#L40-L78) blindly divides by the dimensions of the target shape. Hence, if this is not checked, code will result in a division by 0.\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [4923de56ec94fff7770df259ab7f2288a74feb41](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4923de56ec94fff7770df259ab7f2288a74feb41).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1 as this is the other affected version.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",
