    "Description": "### Impact\nIf the arguments to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather` don't determine a valid ragged tensor code can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedGather(\n  params_nested_splits = [0,0,0],\n  params_dense_values = [1,1],\n  indices = [0,0,9,0,0],\n  OUTPUT_RAGGED_RANK=0)\n```\n\nIn debug mode, the same code triggers a `CHECK` failure.\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_gather_op.cc#L70) directly reads the first dimension of a tensor shape before checking that said tensor has rank of at least 1 (i.e., it is not a scalar). Furthermore, the implementation does not check that the list given by `params_nested_splits` is not an empty list of tensors.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a2b743f6017d7b97af1fe49087ae15f0ac634373](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a2b743f6017d7b97af1fe49087ae15f0ac634373).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",
