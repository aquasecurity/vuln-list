    "Description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `ThreadPoolHandle`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/threadpool_dataset_op.cc#L79-L135) can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by allocating too much memory:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ny = tf.raw_ops.ThreadPoolHandle(num_threads=0x60000000,display_name='tf')\n```\n\nThis is because the `num_threads` argument is only checked to not be negative, but there is no upper bound on its value.\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e3749a6d5d1e8d11806d4a2e9cc3123d1a90b75e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e3749a6d5d1e8d11806d4a2e9cc3123d1a90b75e).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.",
