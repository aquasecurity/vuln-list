    "Description": "### Impact\n\nlookatme versions prior to 2.3.0 automatically loaded the built-in \"terminal\" and \"file_loader\" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to lookatme versions 2.3.0 or above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110\n* https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [d0c-s4vage/lookatme](https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme)",
