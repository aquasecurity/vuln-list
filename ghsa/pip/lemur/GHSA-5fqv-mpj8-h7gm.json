If you generated your config secrets in a more secure way, they are not known to be compromised, but you should still upgrade Lemur to ensure that you receive code fixes for the runtime-generated secrets.\n\nFor general information and guidance on Lemur secret configuration, see [Lemur's configuration documentation](https://lemur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administration.html#configuration), which includes information on many of the configuration options listed above.\n\n*For the user passwords: Even though these users are configured to use SSO, they do get generated with valid database passwords that can be used to log in. Since Lemur doesn't have an option to change passwords (#3888), one option for rotating them would be to directly modify the value in the database to some other unguessable string (you do not need to know the plaintext password since it won't be used).\n\n### Patches\nThe patch is available in v1.3.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are available.\n\n### References\nN/A",
