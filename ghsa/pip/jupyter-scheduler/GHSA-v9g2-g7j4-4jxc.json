    "Description": "### Impact\n\n`jupyter_scheduler` is missing an authentication check in Jupyter Server on an API endpoint (`GET /scheduler/runtime_environments`) which lists the names of the Conda environments on the server. In affected versions, `jupyter_scheduler` allows an unauthenticated user to obtain the list of Conda environment names on the server. This reveals any information that may be present in a Conda environment name.\n\nThis issue does **not** allow an unauthenticated third party to read, modify, or enter the Conda environments present on the server where `jupyter_scheduler` is running. This issue only reveals the list of Conda environment names.\n\nImpacted versions: `\u003e=1.0.0,\u003c=1.1.5 ; ==1.2.0 ; \u003e=1.3.0,\u003c=1.8.1 ; \u003e=2.0.0,\u003c=2.5.1`\n\n### Patches\n\n* `jupyter-scheduler==1.1.6`\n* `jupyter-scheduler==1.2.1`\n* `jupyter-scheduler==1.8.2`\n* `jupyter-scheduler==2.5.2`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nServer operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-scheduler` extension with:\n\n```\njupyter server extension disable jupyter-scheduler\n```\n\n### References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page [1] or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com). Please do not create a public GitHub issue.\n\n[1] Vulnerability reporting page: https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting\n",
