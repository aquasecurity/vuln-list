    "Description": "### Impact\n\nDue to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter.\n\nIn the following example, calling `test` returns `354`, meaning that the variable `a` did store `354` a value out of bound for the type `uint8`.\n\n```Vyper\n@external\ndef test() -\u003e uint16:\n    x:uint8 = 255\n    a:uint8 = 0\n    for i in range(x, x+100):\n        a = i\n    return convert(a,uint16)\n```\n\nThe issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable.\n\nthanks to @trocher for reporting\n\n### Patches\n\npatched in 3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868\n\n### Workarounds\n\n ",
