    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen performing a function call inside an array, there is a memory corruption issue that occurs because of an incorrect pointer to the the tip of the stack.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was partially fixed in [VVE-2020-0004](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-2r3x-4mrv-mcxf), however the fix did not update similar code for arrays, which had a similar issue. The issue is fully fixed in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2345",
