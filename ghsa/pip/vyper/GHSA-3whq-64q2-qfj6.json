    "Description": "### Summary\nUsing the `create_from_blueprint` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when `raw_args=True` and the `args` argument has side-effects. \n\nA contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. In particular, the `raw_args` variant of `create_from_blueprint` was not found to be used in production.\n\n### Details\nIt can be seen that the `_build_create_IR` function of the `create_from_blueprint` builtin doesn't cache the mentioned `args` argument to the stack: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/cedf7087e68e67c7bfbd47ae95dcb16b81ad2e02/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L1847\n\nAs such, it can be evaluated multiple times (instead of retrieving the value from the stack).\n\n### PoC\nThe vulnerability is demonstrated in the following `boa` test:\n``` vyper\nsrc1 = \"\"\"\nc: uint256\n\"\"\"\ndeployer = \"\"\"\ncreated_address: public(address)\ndeployed: public(uint256)\n\n@external\ndef get() -\u003e Bytes[32]:\n    self.deployed += 1\n    return b''\n\n@external\ndef create_(target: address):\n    self.created_address = create_from_blueprint(target, raw_call(self, method_id(\"get()\"), max_outsize=32), raw_args=True, code_offset=3)\n\"\"\"\n\nFactory = b.loads_partial(src1)\nc = Factory.deploy_as_blueprint()\n\nc2 = b.loads(deployer, b'')\nc2.create_(c)\nc2.deployed()\n```\nThe output of `c2.deployed()` is `2` although `create_` was called only once and the value was initialized to `0`.\n\n### Impact\nNo vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is `low`.\n",
