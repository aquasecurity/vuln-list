    "Description": "### Arbitrary Code Execution in Keras\n\nKeras versions prior to 3.11.0 allow for arbitrary code execution when loading a crafted `.keras` model archive, even when `safe_mode=True`.\n\nThe issue arises because the archiveâ€™s `config.json` is parsed before layer deserialization. This can invoke `keras.config.enable_unsafe_deserialization()`, effectively disabling safe mode from within the loading process itself. An attacker can place this call first in the archive and then include a `Lambda` layer whose function is deserialized from a pickle, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled Python code as soon as a victim loads the model file.\n\nExploitation requires a user to open an untrusted model; no additional privileges are needed. The fix in version 3.11.0 enforces safe-mode semantics *before* reading any user-controlled configuration and prevents the toggling of unsafe deserialization via the config file.\n\n**Affected versions:** \u003c 3.11.0\n**Patched version:** 3.11.0\n\nIt is recommended to upgrade to version 3.11.0 or later and to avoid opening untrusted model files.",
