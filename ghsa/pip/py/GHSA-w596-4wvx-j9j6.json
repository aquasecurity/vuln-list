    "Description": "The py library through 1.11.0 for Python allows remote attackers to conduct a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack via a Subversion repository with crafted info data, because the InfoSvnCommand argument is mishandled.\n\nThe particular codepath in question is the regular expression at `py._path.svnurl.InfoSvnCommand.lspattern` and is only relevant when dealing with subversion (svn) projects. Notably the codepath is not used in the popular pytest project. The developers of the pytest package have released version `7.2.0` which removes their dependency on `py`. Users of `pytest` seeing alerts relating to this advisory may update to version `7.2.0` of `pytest` to resolve this issue. See https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/issues/287#issuecomment-1290407715 for additional context.",
