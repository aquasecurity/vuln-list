    "Description": "The mlflow web server includes tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. As this vulnerability allows to write / overwrite any file on the file system, it gives a lot of ways to archive code execution (like overwriting `/home/\u003cuser\u003e/.bashrc`). A malicious user could use this issue to get command execution on the vulnerable machine and get access to data \u0026 models information.",
