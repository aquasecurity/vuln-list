    "Description": "Anyscale Ray 2.52.0 contains an insecure default configuration in which token-based authentication for Ray management interfaces (including the dashboard and Jobs API) is disabled unless explicitly enabled by setting RAY_AUTH_MODE=token. In the default unauthenticated state, a remote attacker with network access to these interfaces can submit jobs and execute arbitrary code on the Ray cluster. NOTE: The vendor plans to enable token authentication by default in a future release. They recommend enabling token authentication to protect your cluster from unauthorized access.",
