    "Description": "The Fides webserver requires a connection to a hosted PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of application data. If the password used by the webserver for this database connection includes special characters such as `@` and `$`, webserver startup fails and the part of the password following the special character is exposed in webserver error logs.\n\nThis is caused by improper escaping of the SQLAlchemy password string, see [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#escaping-special-characters-such-as-signs-in-passwords) and [here](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/discussions/6615) for more info.\n\n### Impact\nPartial exposure of hosted database password in webserver logs\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.37.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n1. Create a hosted PostgreSQL database for Fides with a password including `@` or `$` e.g. `p@ssword`\n2. Run Fides and observe failure, sample log attached\n\n```\nfides  | 2024-02-28 14:27:52.609 | ERROR    | fides.api.db.database:configure_db:117 - Unable to configure database: sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not translate host name \"ssword@fides-db\" to address: Name or service not known\n```",
