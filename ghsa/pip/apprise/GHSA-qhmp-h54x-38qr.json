    "Description": "### Impact\nAnyone _publicly_ hosting the Apprise library and granting them access to the IFTTT notification service.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to Apprise v0.9.5.1\n   ```bash\n   # Install Apprise v0.9.5.1 from PyPI\n   pip install apprise==0.9.5.1\n   ```\n\nThe patch to the problem was performed [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/pull/436/files).\n\n### Workarounds\nAlternatively, if upgrading is not an option, you can safely remove the following file:\n- `apprise/plugins/NotifyIFTTT.py` \n\nThe above will eliminate the ability to use IFTTT, but everything else will work smoothly.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/issues)\n* Email me at [lead2gold@gmail.com](mailto:lead2gold@gmail.com)\n\n### Additional Credit\nGithub would not allow me to additionally credit **Rasmus Petersen**, but I would like to put that here at the very least - thank you for finding and reporting this issue along with those already credited\n\n## Additional Notes:\n- Github would not allow me to add/tag the 2 CWE's this issue is applicable to (only CWE-400).  The other is: CWE-730 (placed in the title)\n",
