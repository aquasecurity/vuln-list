    "Description": "### Impact\r\nAnyone _publicly_ hosting the Apprise library and granting them access to the IFTTT notification service.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nUpdate to Apprise v0.9.5.1\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Install Apprise v0.9.5.1 from PyPI\r\n   pip install apprise==0.9.5.1\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThe patch to the problem was performed [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/pull/436/files).\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAlternatively, if upgrading is not an option, you can safely remove the following file:\r\n- `apprise/plugins/NotifyIFTTT.py` \r\n\r\nThe above will eliminate the ability to use IFTTT, but everything else will work smoothly.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/issues)\r\n* Email me at [lead2gold@gmail.com](mailto:lead2gold@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n### Additional Credit\r\nGithub would not allow me to additionally credit **Rasmus Petersen**, but I would like to put that here at the very least - thank you for finding and reporting this issue along with those already credited\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes:\r\n- Github would not allow me to add/tag the 2 CWE's this issue is applicable to (only CWE-400).  The other is: CWE-730 (placed in the title)\r\n",
