    "Description": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-jgw4-cr84-mqxg. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nAn Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the scanning logic of mmaitre314 picklescan versions up to and including 0.0.30 allows a remote attacker to bypass pickle files security checks by supplying a standard pickle file with a PyTorch-related file extension. When the pickle file incorrectly considered safe is loaded, it can lead to the execution of malicious code.",
