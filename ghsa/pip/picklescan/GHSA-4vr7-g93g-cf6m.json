    "Description": "### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-m4j5-5x4r-2xp9. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nAn Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the ZIP archive scanning component of mmaitre314 picklescan allows a remote attacker to bypass security scans. This is achieved by crafting a ZIP archive containing a file with a bad Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), which causes the scanner to halt and fail to analyze the contents for malicious pickle files.Â When the file incorrectly considered safe is loaded, it can lead to the execution of malicious code.",
