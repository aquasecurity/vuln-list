    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to unexpected long runtime.\nThis quadratic runtime blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/808\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n### References\n* [PyPDF2 PR #808](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/808)\n* [PyPDF2 Issue #582](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/582)",
