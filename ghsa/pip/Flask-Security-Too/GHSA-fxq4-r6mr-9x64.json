    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen a user is setting up two-factor authentication using an authenticator app, a QRcode is generated and made available via a GET request to /tf-qrcode. Since GETs do not have any CSRF protection, it is possible a malicious 3rd party could access the QRcode and therefore gain access to two-factor authentication codes. Note that the /tf-qrcode endpoint is ONLY accessible while the user is initially setting up their device. Once setup is complete, there is no vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nThis is fixed in the upcoming 4.0.0 release.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can provide your own URL for fetching the QRcode by defining SECURITY_TWO_FACTOR_QRCODE_URL and providing your own implementation (that presumably required a POST with CSRF protection). This would require changing the two-factor setup template as well.\n\n### References\nNone.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Read this pull request: #423",
