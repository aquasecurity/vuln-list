    "Description": "# Description\nI found a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in PyTorch. When loading model using torch.load with weights_only=True, it can still achieve RCE.  \n\n# Background knowledge\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security \n As you can see, the PyTorch official documentation considers using `torch.load()` with `weights_only=True` to be safe.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdaa8520-d66a-473a-ab1f-163d793de298)\nSince everyone knows that weights_only=False is unsafe, so they will use the  weights_only=True to mitigate the seucirty issue.\nBut now, I just proved that even if you use weights_only=True, it can still achieve RCE.\n\n# Credit\nThis vulnerability was found by Ji'an Zhou.",
