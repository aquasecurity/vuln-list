    "Description": "Jenkins sets the Content-Security-Policy header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically DirectoryBrowserSupport), such as workspaces, /userContent, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.\n\nRed Hat Dependency Analytics Plugin 0.7.1 and earlier globally disables the Content-Security-Policy header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'Invoke Red Hat Dependency Analytics (RHDA)' build step is executed. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.\n",
