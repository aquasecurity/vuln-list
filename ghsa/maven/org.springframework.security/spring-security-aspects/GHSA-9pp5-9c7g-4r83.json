    "Description": "Spring Security Aspects may not correctly locate method security annotations on private methods. This can cause an authorization bypass.\n\nYour application may be affected by this if the following are true:\n\n  *  You are using @EnableMethodSecurity(mode=ASPECTJ) and spring-security-aspects, and\n  *  You have Spring Security method annotations on a private method\nIn that case, the target method may be able to be invoked without proper authorization.\n\nYou are not affected if:\n\n  *  You are not using @EnableMethodSecurity(mode=ASPECTJ) or spring-security-aspects, or\n  *  You have no Spring Security-annotated private methods",
