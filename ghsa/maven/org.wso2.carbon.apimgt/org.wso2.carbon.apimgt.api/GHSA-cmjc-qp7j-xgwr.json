    "Description": "An authenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in WSO2 API Manager components (`carbon-apimgt`) due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input during API document upload in the Publisher portal.\n\nA user with publisher privileges can upload a crafted API document whose contents are later rendered in the UI for other users, leading to attacker-controlled script execution. Likely outcomes include redirection to malicious sites, unauthorized UI modifications, or exfiltration of data accessible to the browser; session hijacking is mitigated by the use of `HttpOnly` session cookies.\n\nTo remediate, update to version 9.31.117 or above.",
