    "Description": "An authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper validation of user-supplied input during API document upload in the Publisher portal. A user with publisher privileges can upload a crafted API document containing malicious JavaScript, which is later rendered in the browser when accessed by other users.\n\nA successful attack could result in redirection to malicious websites, unauthorized UI modifications, or exfiltration of browser-accessible data. However, session-related sensitive cookies are protected by the httpOnly flag, preventing session hijacking.",
