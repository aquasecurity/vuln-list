    "Description": "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Kylin. \nIf an attacker gets access to Kylin's system or project admin permission, the JDBC connection configuration maybe altered to execute arbitrary code from the remote. You are fine as long as the Kylin's system and project admin access is well protected.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Kylin: from 4.0.0 through 5.0.1.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.2 or above, which fixes the issue.",
