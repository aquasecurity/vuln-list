    "Description": "### Impact\n\nUsers with the role `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role `ROLE_ADMIN`. For example:\n\n```bash\n# Use the admin to create a new user with ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN using the admin user.\n# We expect this to work.\n% curl -i -u admin:opencast 'https://example.opencast.org/user-utils/xy.json' -X PUT \\\n  --data 'password=f\u0026roles=%5B%22ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN%22%5D'\nHTTP/2 201\n\n# Use the new user to create more new users.\n# We don't expüect a user with just role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN to succeed.\n# But it does work\n% curl -i -u xy:f 'https://example.opencast.org/user-utils/ab.json' -X PUT \\\n  --data 'password=f\u0026roles=%5B%22ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN%22%5D'\nHTTP/2 201\n```\n`ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the name – implying an admin for a specific course – users would never expect that this role allows user creation.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in 7.6 and 8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can fix this issue by removing all instances of `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` in your organization's security configuration (`etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` by default).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in [opencast/opencast](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n- For security-relevant information, email us at security@opencast.org",
