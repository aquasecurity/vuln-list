    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe security configuration in `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from the [username, password, and an additional system key](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/remember-me.html). Opencast has hard-coded this system key in the large XML file and never mentions to change this, basically ensuring that all systems use the same key:\n\n```xml\n\u003csec:remember-me key=\"opencast\" user-service-ref=\"userDetailsService\" /\u003e\n```\n\nThis means that an attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. For example, a remember-me token obtained from develop.opencast.org can be used on stable.opencast.org without actually knowing the log-in credentials.\n\nSuch an attack will usually not work on different installations – assuming that safe, unique passwords are used – but it is basically guaranteed to work to get access to all machines of one cluster if a token from one machine is compromised.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe strongly recommend updating to the patched version. Still, as a workaround for older versions, in `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml`, set a custom key for each server:\n\n```xml\n\u003csec:remember-me key=\"CUSTOM_RANDOM_KEY\" user-service-ref=\"userDetailsService\" /\u003e\n```\n\n### References\n\n- [Relevant lines in the security configuration](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/blob/161ee619382f144dc35eea211fc6b556025b98e1/etc/security/mh_default_org.xml#L335-L336)\n- [Spring Security Remember-Me Authentication Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/remember-me.html#remember-me-hash-token)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Open an issue in [opencast/opencast](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n- For security-relevant information, email us at [security@opencast.org](mailto:security@opencast.org)\n\n### Thanks\nThanks to @LukasKalbertodt for reporting the issue.",
