    "Description": "### Description\nOpencast prior to versions 17.6 would incorrectly send the hashed global system account credentials (ie: `org.opencastproject.security.digest.user` and `org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass`) when attempting to fetch mediapackage elements included in a mediapackage XML file.  A [previous CVE](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-hcxx-mp6g-6gr9) prevented many cases where the credentials were inappropriately sent, but not all.  The remainder are addressed with this patch.\n\n### Impact\nAnyone with ingest permissions could cause Opencast to send its hashed global system account credentials to a url of their choosing.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed in Opencast 17.6\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Open an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n- Email us at security@opencast.org",
