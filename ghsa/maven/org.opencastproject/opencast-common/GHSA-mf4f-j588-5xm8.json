    "Description": "### Impact\n\nOpencast uses an Apache Log4j2 version which, combined with older JDK versions, can be used for remote code execution attacks which have been found to be actively exploited.\n\nApache Log4j2 \u003c=2.14.1 JNDI features is not sufficiently protected. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code when message lookup substitution is enabled.\n\n### Who is affected\n\n- Opencast before 9.10 or 10.6 are affected\n    - Log4j version: all 2.x versions before 2.15.0 are affected\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in Opencast 9.10 and 10.6.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe vulnerability can be mitigated by setting system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`.\n\n### References\n\n- [Opencast pull request mitigating the vulnerability](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/3253)\n- [CVE-2021-44228 Detail](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)\n- [Analysis and Remediation Guidance to the Log4j Zero-Day RCE (CVE-2021-44228) Vulnerability](https://www.veracode.com/blog/security-news/urgent-analysis-and-remediation-guidance-log4j-zero-day-rce-cve-2021-44228)\n- [VE-2021-44228 â€“ Log4j 2 Vulnerability Analysis](https://www.randori.com/blog/cve-2021-44228/)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/issues)\n* Email us at [security@opencast.org](mailto:security@opencast.org)\n\n\n### Note about dependencies\n\nThis issue affects many Java applications.
