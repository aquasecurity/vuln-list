    "Description": "### Summary\nThe value of `nvdApiKey` configuration parameter is logged in clear text in debug mode.\n\n### Details\nThe NVD API key is a kind of secret and should be treated like other secrets when logging in debug mode.\nExpecting the same behavior as for several password configurations: just print `******`\n\nNote that while the NVD API Key is an access token for the NVD API - they are not that sensitive. The only thing an NVD API Token grants is a higher rate limit when making calls to publicly available data. The data available from the NVD API is the same whether you have an API Key or not.\n\n### PoC\nThe nvdApiKey is configured to use an environment variable; when running `mvn -X dependency-check:check` the clear value is logged twice.\n\n### Impact\nThe NVD API key is a kind of secret and should not be exposed. If stolen, an attacker can use this key to obtain already public information.\n\n",
