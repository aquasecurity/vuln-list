    "Description": "### Impact\nCredential replay affecting those connected to a server when *all 3* of the following conditions are met:\n- `SecurityPolicy` is `None`\n- using username/password or X509-based authentication\n- the server has a defect causing it to send null/empty or zeroed nonces \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in version `0.3.6`. A more relaxed treatment of validation as agreed upon by the OPC UA Security Working Group is implemented in version `0.3.7`.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use username/password or X509-based authentication with `SecurityPolicy` of `None`.\n\n### References\nhttps://opcfoundation.org/SecurityBulletins/OPC%20Foundation%20Security%20Bulletin%20CVE-2019-19135.pdf\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue at [https://github.com/eclipse/milo/issues](https://github.com/eclipse/milo/issues)\n* Email [the mailing list](mailto:milo-dev@eclipse.org)",
