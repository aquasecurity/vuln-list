    "Description": "CloudBees CD Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM during the deployment/publication of an application.\n\nCloudBees CD Plugin no longer does that. Instead, the existing opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors is used during deployment for the specific connection.\n\nThis issue was caused by an incomplete fix for [SECURITY-937](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-02-19/#SECURITY-937).",
