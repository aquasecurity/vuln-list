    "Description": "Jenkins Sensedia Api Platform tools Plugin 1.0 stores the Sensedia API Manager integration token unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.sensedia.configuration.SensediaApiConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThis token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the global configuration form does not mask the token, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
