    "Description": "S3 Publisher Plugin stores a secret key in its global configuration. While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.4 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations. S3 Publisher Plugin 0.11.5 transmits the secret key in its global configuration encrypted.",
