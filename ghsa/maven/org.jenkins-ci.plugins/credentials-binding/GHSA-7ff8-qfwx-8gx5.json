    "Description": "Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds. As a side effect of the fix for [SECURITY-698](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding), `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`. This will then be expanded to $ again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.\n\nCredentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`). This occurs for example in the \\\"Execute Maven top-level targets\\\" build step included in Jenkins.\\n\\nCredentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters, so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.",
