    "Description": "Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nPipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.3 requires POST requests and Job/Configure permission for the affected form validation method.",
