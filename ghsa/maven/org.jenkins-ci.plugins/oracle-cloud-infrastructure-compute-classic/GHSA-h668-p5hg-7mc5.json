This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.\n\nAdditionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory there is no fix.",
