    "Description": "Jenkins Code Dx Plugin 3.1.0 and earlier stores Code Dx server API keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nCode Dx Plugin 4.0.0 no longer stores the API keys directly, instead accessing them through its newly added Credentials Plugin integration. Affected jobs need to be reconfigured.",
