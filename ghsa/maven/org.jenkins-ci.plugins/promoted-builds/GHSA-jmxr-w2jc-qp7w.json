    "Description": "Jenkins promoted builds Plugin provides dedicated support for defining promotions using [Job DSL Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl).\n\npromoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db_d64130 and earlier does not validate the names of promotions defined in Job DSL. This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to create a promotion with an unsafe name. As a result, the promotion name could be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) or to replace other `config.xml` files.\n\npromoted builds Plugin 876.v99d29788b_36b_ and 3.10.1 validates the name of promotions.",
