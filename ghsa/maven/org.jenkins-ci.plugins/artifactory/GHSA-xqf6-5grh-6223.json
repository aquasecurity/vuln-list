    "Description": "Jenkins Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 and earlier stores Artifactory server passwords in its global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nWhile the password is stored encrypted on disk since Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.\n\nArtifactory Plugin 3.6.1 transmits the password in its global configuration encrypted.",
