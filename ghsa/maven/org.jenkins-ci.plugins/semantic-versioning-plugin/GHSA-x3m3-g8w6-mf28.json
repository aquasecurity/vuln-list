    "Description": "Jenkins Semantic Versioning Plugin defines a controller/agent message that processes a given file as XML and returns version information. The XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, which is only a problem if XML documents are parsed on the Jenkins controller.\n\nJenkins Semantic Versioning Plugin 1.13 and earlier does not restrict execution of a controller/agent message to agents, and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nThis vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier. See the [LTS upgrade guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3).",
