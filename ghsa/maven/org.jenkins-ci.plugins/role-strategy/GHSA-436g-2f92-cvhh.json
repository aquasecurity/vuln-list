    "Description": "Permissions in Jenkins can be enabled and disabled. Some permissions are disabled by default, e.g., Overall/Manage or Item/Extended Read. Disabled permissions cannot be granted directly, only through greater permissions that imply them (e.g., Overall/Administer or Item/Configure).\n\nRole-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 587.v2872c41fa_e51 and earlier grants permissions even after they’ve been disabled.\n\nThis allows attackers to have greater access than they’re entitled to after the following operations took place:\n\nA permission is granted to attackers directly or through groups.\n\nThe permission is disabled, e.g., through the script console.\n\nRole-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 587.588.v850a_20a_30162 does not grant disabled permissions.",
