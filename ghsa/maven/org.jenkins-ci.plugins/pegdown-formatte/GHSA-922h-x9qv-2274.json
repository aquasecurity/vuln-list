    "Description": "PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to implement support for rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins. It advertises disabling of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.\n\nPegDown Formatter Plugin does not prevent the use of `javascript:` scheme in URLs for links. This results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are rendered by the configured markup formatter.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
