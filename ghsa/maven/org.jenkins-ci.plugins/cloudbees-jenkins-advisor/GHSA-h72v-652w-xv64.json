    "Description": "Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.\n\nAdditionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nHealth Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.",
