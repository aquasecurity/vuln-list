    "Description": "Jenkins ReadyAPI Functional Testing Plugin 1.11 and earlier stores SLM License Access Keys, client secrets, and passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese credentials can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the job configuration form does not mask these credentials, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
