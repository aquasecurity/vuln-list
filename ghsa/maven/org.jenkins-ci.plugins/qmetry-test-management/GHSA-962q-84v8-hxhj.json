    "Description": "QMetry Test Management Plugin 1.13 and earlier stores Qmetry Automation API Keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
