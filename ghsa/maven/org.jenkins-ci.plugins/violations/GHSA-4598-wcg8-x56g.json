    "Description": "Violations Plugin 0.7.11 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nThis allows attackers to control XML input files for the 'Report Violations' post-build step to have agent processes parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent or server-side request forgery.\n\nBecause Jenkins agent processes usually execute build tools whose input (source code, build scripts, etc.) is controlled externally, this vulnerability only has a real impact in very narrow circumstances: when attackers can control XML files, but are unable to change build steps, Jenkinsfiles, test code that gets executed on the agents, or similar.",
