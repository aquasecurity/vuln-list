    "Description": "Script Security Plugin 1189.vb_a_b_7c8fd5fde and earlier stores whole-script approvals as the [SHA-1 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) of the approved script. SHA-1 no longer meets the security standards for producing a cryptographically secure message digest.\n\nScript Security Plugin 1190.v65867a_a_47126 uses SHA-512 for new whole-script approvals. Previously approved scripts will have their SHA-1 based whole-script approval replaced with a corresponding SHA-512 whole-script approval when the script is next used.\n\nWhole-script approval only stores the SHA-1 or SHA-512 hash, so it is not possible to migrate all previously approved scripts automatically on startup.\n\nAdministrators concerned about SHA-1 collision attacks on the whole-script approval feature are able to revoke all previous (SHA-1) script approvals on the In-Process Script Approval page.",
