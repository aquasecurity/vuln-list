    "Description": "### Vulnerability Overview\nA vulnerability has been identified in Central Dogma versions prior to 0.64.0, allowing for the leakage of user sessions and subsequent authentication bypass. The issue stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack vector that targets the RelayState of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).\n\n### Impact\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability enables malicious actors to leak user sessions, leading to the compromise of authentication mechanisms. This, in turn, can facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive resources.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability is addressed and resolved in Central Dogma version 0.64.0. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version or later to mitigate the risk associated with the authentication bypass.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo viable workarounds are currently available for this vulnerability. It is recommended to apply the provided patch promptly.\n\n### References\n- [OASIS SAML v2.0 Errata 05](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/errata05/os/saml-v2.0-errata05-os.html#__RefHeading__8196_1983180497)\n- [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#xss-defense-philosophy)",
