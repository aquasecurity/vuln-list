    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is a disclosure for a security vulnerability in the `SparseMatrix` class. The vulnerability is a deserialization issue that\ncan lead to a wide range of privilege escalations depending on the circumstances. The problematic area is the `read` method\nof the `SparseMatrix` class.\nThis method takes in an `InputStream` and returns a `SparseMatrix` object. We consider this to be a method that can be\nexposed to untrusted input in at least two use cases:\n- A user can adopt this method in an application where users can submit an `InputStream` and the application parses it into\na `SparseMatrix`. This can be a multi-tenant application that hosts many different users perhaps with different privilege\nlevels.\n- A user adopts the method for a local tool but receives the `InputStream` from external sources.\n\n#### Am I impacted?\nYou are vulnerable if you import non-controlled serialized `SparseMatrix` objects.\n\n\n### Patches\ncom.powsybl:powsybl-math:6.7.2 and higher\n\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nDo not use `SparseMatrix` deserialization (`SparseMatrix.read(...)` methods).\n\n### References\n[powsybl-core v6.7.2](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core/releases/tag/v6.7.2)",
