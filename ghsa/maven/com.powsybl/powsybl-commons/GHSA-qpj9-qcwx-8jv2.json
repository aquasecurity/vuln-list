    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nIn certain places, powsybl-core XML parsing is vulnerable to an XXE attack and in on place also to an SSRF attack.\nThis allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to read files that they do not have permissions to, including sensitive files on the system.\nThe vulnerable class is `com.powsybl.commons.xml.XmlReader` which is considered to be untrusted in use cases where untrusted users can submit their XML to the vulnerable methods. This can be a multi-tenant application that hosts many different users perhaps with different privilege levels.\n\n#### Am I impacted?\nYou are vulnerable if you allow untrusted users to import untrusted CGMES or XIIDM network files.\n\n### Patches\ncom.powsybl:powsybl-commons:6.7.2 and higher\n\n### References\n[powsybl-core v6.7.2](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core/releases/tag/v6.7.2)",
