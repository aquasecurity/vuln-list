    "Description": "### Impact\nAll objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users.\n\nIf object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations.\n\n### Attack requirements\nThe following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack:\n- A user must be logged in\n  - No relevant application roles are required\n- At least one object-type must be configured via object-management\n  - The scope of the attack is limited to objects that are configured via object-management.\n  - The value of `showInDataMenu` is irrelevant for this attack\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is possible to override the endpoint security as defined in `ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer` and `ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer`. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.",
