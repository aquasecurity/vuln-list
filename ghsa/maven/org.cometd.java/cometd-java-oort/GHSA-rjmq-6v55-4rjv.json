    "Description": "### Impact\nInternal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels.\nBy subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other user's (possibly sensitive) data.\nBy publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure.\nThe issue impacts any version up to 5.0.10, 6.0.5 and 7.0.5.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in 5.0.11, 6.0.6 and 7.0.6.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe workaround is to install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\nThis workaround could be implemented in any affected version.\n\n### References\ncometd/cometd#1146\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@webtide.com](mailto:security@webtide.com)\n\n### Credits\nhttps://www.redteam-pentesting.de/",
