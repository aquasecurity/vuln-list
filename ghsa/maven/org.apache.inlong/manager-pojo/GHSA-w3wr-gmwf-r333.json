    "Description": "Weak Password Requirements vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache InLong. This issue affects Apache InLong from 1.1.0 through 1.6.0.Â When users change their password to a simple password (with any character or symbol), attackers can easily guess the user's password and access the account. Users are advised to upgrade to Apache InLong 1.7.0 or cherry-pick https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7805 to solve it.\n\n\n",
