    "Description": "Jenkins Statistics Gatherer Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier stores the AWS Secret Key unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkins.plugins.statistics.gatherer.StatisticsConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThis key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the global configuration form does not mask this key, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
