    "Description": "### Impact\nThe [Livetable Macro](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Livetable%20Macro) wasn't properly sanitizing column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the [Documents Macro](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Documents%20Macro) that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents id=\"example\" count=\"5\" actions=\"false\" columns=\"doc.title, before\u003cscript\u003ealert(1)\u003c/script\u003eafter\"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is possible to apply the [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/65ca06c51e7a1d5a579344c7272b2cc9a9a21126) to existing installations without upgrading. Only the files `skins/flamingo/macros.vm` and `templates/macros.vm` in the web application directory need to be replaced by a patched version.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n",
