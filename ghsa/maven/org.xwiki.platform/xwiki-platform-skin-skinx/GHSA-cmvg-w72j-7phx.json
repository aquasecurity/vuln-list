    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThere was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user with appropriate rights. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has Script right. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only known workaround consists in applying [the following patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fe65bc35d5672dd2505b7ac4ec42aec57d500fbb) and rebuilding and redeploying `xwiki-platform-skin-skinx`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](http://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n",
