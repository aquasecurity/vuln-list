    "Description": "### Impact\nIt's possible for an unprivileged user to perform a remote code execution by injecting a groovy script in her own profile and by calling the Reset password feature since the feature is performing a save of the user profile with programming rights in the impacted versions of XWiki.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 13.1RC1 with a complete refactoring of the Reset password feature.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere's different possible workarounds, all consisting in modifying the XWiki/ResetPassword page.\n  - the Reset password feature can be entirely disabled by deleting the XWiki/ResetPassword page\n  - the script in XWiki/ResetPassword can also be modified or removed: an administrator can replace it with a simple email contact to ask an administrator to reset the password. \n\n### References\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-16661\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security mailing-list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n",
