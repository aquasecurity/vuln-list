    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible for anyone to inject SQL using the parameter sort of the `getdeleteddocuments.vm`. It's injected as is as an ORDER BY value.\n\nOne can see the result of the injection with http://127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/rest/liveData/sources/liveTable/entries?sourceParams.template=getdeleteddocuments.vm\u0026sort=injected (this example does not work, but it shows that an HQL query was executed with the passed value which look nothing like an order by value, without any kind of sanitation).\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in 17.3.0-rc-1, 16.10.6.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-23093\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThe vulnerability was identifier by Aleksey Solovev from Positive Technologies.",
