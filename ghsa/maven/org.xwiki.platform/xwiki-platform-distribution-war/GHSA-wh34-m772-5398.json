    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn `getdocument.vm` ; the ordering of the returned documents is defined from an unsanitized request parameter (request.sort) and can allow any user to inject HQL.\n\nDepending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries.\n\nIt's possible to employ database backend dependent techniques of breaking out of HQL query context, described, for example, here: https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/exploiting-hibernate-injections.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17568\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)",
