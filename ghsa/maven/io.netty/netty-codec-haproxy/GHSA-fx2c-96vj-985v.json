    "Description": "### Impact\nA StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an infinite recursion.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to 4.1.86.Final.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.\n\n### References\nWhen parsing a TLV with type = PP2_TYPE_SSL, the value can be again a TLV with type = PP2_TYPE_SSL and so on.\nThe only limitation of the recursion is that the TLV length cannot be bigger than 0xffff because it is encoded in an unsigned short type.\nProviding a TLV with a nesting level that is large enough will lead to raising of a StackOverflowError.\nThe StackOverflowError will be caught if HAProxyMessageDecoder is used as part of Nettyâ€™s ChannelPipeline, but using it directly without the ChannelPipeline will lead to a thrown exception / crash.\n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)\n",
