    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen calling `DefaultHttpHeaders.set` with an _iterator_ of values (as opposed to a single given value), header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the iterator to perform [HTTP Response Splitting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting).\n\n### Patches\nThe necessary validation was added in Netty 4.1.86.Final.\n\n### Workarounds\nIntegrators can work around the issue by changing the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator\u003c?\u003e)` call, into a `remove()` call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.\n\n### References\n[HTTP Response Splitting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting)\n[CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [[example link to repo](https://github.com/netty/netty)](https://github.com/netty/netty)\n* Email us at [netty-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:netty-security@googlegroups.com)\n",
