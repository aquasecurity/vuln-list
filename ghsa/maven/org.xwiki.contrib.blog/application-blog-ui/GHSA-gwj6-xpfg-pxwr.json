    "Description": "### Impact\nThe blog application in XWiki allowed remote code execution for any user who has edit right on any page. Normally, these are all logged-in users as they can edit their own user profile. To exploit, it is sufficient to add an object of type `Blog.BlogPostClass` to any page and to add some script macro with the exploit code to the \"Content\" field of that object.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in the blog application version 9.14 by executing the content of blog posts with the rights of the appropriate author.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe're not aware of any workarounds.\n\n### Resources\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/BLOG-191\n* https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-blog/commit/b98ab6f17da3029576f42d12b4442cd555c7e0b4",
