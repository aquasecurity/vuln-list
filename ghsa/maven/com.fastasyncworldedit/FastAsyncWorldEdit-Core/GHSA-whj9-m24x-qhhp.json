    "Description": "### Coordinated Disclosure Timeline\n\n- 10.06.2023: Issue reported to IntellectualSites\n- 11.06.2023: Issue is acknowledged\n- 12.06.2023: Issue has been fixed\n- 22.06.2023: Advisory has been published\n\n### Impacted version range\n\nBefore 2.6.3\n\n### Details\n\n#### Proof of Concept\n\nAs a user, do the following:\n\n1. Select position 1 via `//pos1`\n2. Select position 2 adding the \"Infinity\" keyword via `//pos2 Infinity`\n3. Execute any further operation.\n\nThe steps 1 and 2 are interchangeable.\n\n#### Impact\n\nSuch a task has a possibility of bringing the performing server down.\n\n#### CVE\n\n- CVE-2023-35925\n\n#### Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered and [reported](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) by @SuperMonis.\n\n### Solution\n\nOn June 12, 2023, a patch, https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit/pull/2285, has been merged addressing the vulnerability.\nWe strongly recommend users to update their version of FastAsyncWorldEdit to 2.6.3 as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no direct mitigation besides updating FastAsyncWorldEdit to a patched version.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nUsers with access to the `logs/` folder or shell access on their server can try to identify possible abuses of this issue by going through the logs.\nTo sieve through the data, you can use the regex query `\\/\\/pos[12] Infinity`, then investigate all log entries that return results.\n\n### Disclosure Policy\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability within our software, please report the issue according to our [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).",
