    "Description": "Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the job name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure job names.\n\nAs job names do not generally support the character set needed for XSS, this is believed to be difficult to exploit in common configurations.\n\nJenkins 2.245, LTS 2.235.2 escapes the job name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip.",
