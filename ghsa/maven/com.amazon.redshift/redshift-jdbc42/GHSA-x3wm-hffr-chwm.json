    "Description": "### Impact\n\nSQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected.\n\n### Patch\n\nThis issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: If you do not explicitly specify a query mode, then you are using the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)\n\n### References\n\nSimilar to finding in Postgres JDBC: https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, we ask that you contact AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
