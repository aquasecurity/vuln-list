    "Description": "A exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in Jenkins GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.41.0 and older in GhprbGitHubAuth.java that allows attackers with Overall/Read access to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. As of version 1.42.0, these form validation methods require POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.",
