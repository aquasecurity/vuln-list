    "Description": "### Summary\nWhen verifying SSL certificates, jruby-openssl is not verifying that the hostname presented in the certificate matches the one we are trying to connect to, meaning a MITM could just present _any_ valid cert for a completely different domain they own, and JRuby wouldn't complain. \n\n### Details\nn/a\n\n### PoC\nAn example domain bad.substitutealert.com was created to present the a certificate for the domain s8a.me. The following script run in IRB in CRuby 3.4.3 will fail with `certificate verify failed (hostname mismatch)`, but will work just fine in JRuby 10.0.0.0 and JRuby 9.4.2.0, both of which use jruby-openssl version 0.15.3\n\n```ruby\nrequire \"net/http\"\nrequire \"openssl\"\n\nuri   = URI(\"https://bad.substitutealert.com/\")\nhttps = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)\nhttps.use_ssl      = true\nhttps.verify_mode  = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER\n\nbody = https.start { https.get(uri.request_uri).body }\nputs body\n```\n\n### Impact\nAnybody using JRuby to make requests of external APIs, or scraping the web, that depends on https to connect securely",
