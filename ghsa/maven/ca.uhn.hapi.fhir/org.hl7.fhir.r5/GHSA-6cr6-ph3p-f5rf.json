    "Description": "### Impact\nXSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag ( `\u003c!DOCTYPE foo [\u003c!ENTITY example SYSTEM \"/etc/passwd\"\u003e ]\u003e` could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in release 6.3.23\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n[MITRE CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)\n[OWASP XML External Entity Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#transformerfactory)\n",
