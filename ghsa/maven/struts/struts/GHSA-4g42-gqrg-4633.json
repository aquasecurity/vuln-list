    "Description": "Denial of service via out of memory (OOM) owing to no sanity limit on normal form fields in multipart forms. When a Multipart request has non-file normal form fields, Struts used to bring them into memory as Strings without checking their sizes. This could lead to an OOM if developer has set struts.multipart.maxSize to a value equal or greater than the available memory.\n\nUpgrade to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1 or greater",
