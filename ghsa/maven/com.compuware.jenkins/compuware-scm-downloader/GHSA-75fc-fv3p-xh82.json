    "Description": "BMC Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.12 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate hosts and ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those credentials IDs can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.\n\nBMC Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.13 requires the appropriate permissions to enumerate hosts and ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs.",
