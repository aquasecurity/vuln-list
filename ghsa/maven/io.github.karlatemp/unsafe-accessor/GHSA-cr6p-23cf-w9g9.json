Can be ignored if `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` not setup\n\n### Details\n\nIf UA was loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA will be protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard api.\nMain application can setup `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit accesses to UA.\nUntrusted code can access UA without lmitation in affected versions even UA was loaded as a named module.\n\n### References\n\n[The commit to fix](https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/commit/4ef83000184e8f13239a1ea2847ee401d81585fd)\n\n",
