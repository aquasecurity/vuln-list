    "Description": "### Impact\n\nACS Commons version 5.1.x (and earlier) suffers from a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `/apps/acs-commons/content/page-compare.html` endpoint via the `a` and `b` GET parameters. User input submitted via these parameters is not validated or sanitized.\n\nAn attacker must provide a link to someone with access to AEM Author, and could potentially exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript content into vulnerable form fields and execute it within the context of the victim's browser. The exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in order to be successful.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 5.2.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone \n\n### References\n\nN/A\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory open an issue in acs-aem-commons.\n\n### Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered and reported by Black Lantern Security.\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/1466020",
