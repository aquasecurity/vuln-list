    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nThe configAPI is an internal service and hence should never be exposed to the internet. With that said, this is a serious vulnerability that has a large internal surface attack area that exposes all sorts of information from the IDP including clients, users, scripts ..etc.\n\nThis affects all users of Janssen \u003c1.8.0 and Gluu Flex \u003c5.8.0\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\nAll users are advised to upgrade immediately to [1.8.0](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases/tag/v1.8.0) for Janssen users and [5.8.0](https://github.com/GluuFederation/flex/releases/tag/v5.8.0) For Flex users.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nThe user can potentially fork and build the config api and patch it in their system following the commit here https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/commit/92eea4d4637f1cae16ad2f07b2c16378ff3fc5f1\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\nhttps://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/issues/11575\nhttps://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/commit/92eea4d4637f1cae16ad2f07b2c16378ff3fc5f1",
