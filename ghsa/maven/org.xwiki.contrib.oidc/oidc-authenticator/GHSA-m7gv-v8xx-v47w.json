    "Description": "### Impact\n\nEven if a wiki has an OpenID provider configured through its xwiki.properties, it is possible to provide a third party provider by providing its details through request parameters. One can then bypass the XWiki authentication altogether by specifying its own provider through the oidc.endpoint.* request parameters (or by using an XWiki-based OpenID provider with oidc.xwikiprovider.\n\nWith the same approach, one could also provide a specific group mapping through oidc.groups.mapping that would make his user automatically part of the XWikiAdminGroup\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in version 1.29.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround, an upgrade of the authenticator is required.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/OIDC-118\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in Jira XWiki\n* Email us at our security mailing list\n\n",
