    "Description": "The Java-WebSocket Client does not perform hostname verification.\n\n - This means that SSL certificates of other hosts are accepted as long as they are trusted. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a Java application using the Java-WebSocket Client and an WebSocket server it's connecting to.\n - TLS normally protects users and systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other trusted hosts are accepted by the client.\n\nFor more information see: CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html\n\n## Important note\n\nThe OWASP Dependency-Check (https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/index.html) may report that a dependency of your project is affected by this security vulnerability, but you don't use this lib.\nThis is caused by the fuzzy search in the OWASP implementation.\nCheck out this issue (https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/issues/1019#issuecomment-628507934) for more information and a way to suppress the warning.",
