    "Description": "Pipeline: Groovy Plugin allows pipelines to load Groovy source files. This is intended to be used to allow Global Shared Libraries to execute without sandbox protection.\n\nIn Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2689.v434009a_31b_f1 and earlier, any Groovy source files bundled with Jenkins core and plugins could be loaded this way and their methods executed. If a suitable Groovy source file is available on the classpath of Jenkins, sandbox protections can be bypassed.\n\nThe Jenkins security team has been unable to identify any Groovy source files in Jenkins core or plugins that would allow attackers to execute dangerous code. While the severity of this issue is declared as High due to the potential impact, successful exploitation is considered very unlikely.\n\nPipeline: Groovy Plugin 2692.v76b_089ccd026 restricts which Groovy source files can be loaded in Pipelines.\n\nGroovy source files in public plugins intended to be executed in sandboxed pipelines have been identified and added to an allowlist. The new extension point `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.cps.GroovySourceFileAllowlist` allows plugins to add specific Groovy source files to that allowlist if necessary, but creation of plugin-specific Pipeline DSLs is strongly discouraged.",
