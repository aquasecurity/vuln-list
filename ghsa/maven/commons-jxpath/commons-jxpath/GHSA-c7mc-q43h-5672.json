This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nThose using JXPath to interpret XPath may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by stackoverflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.",
