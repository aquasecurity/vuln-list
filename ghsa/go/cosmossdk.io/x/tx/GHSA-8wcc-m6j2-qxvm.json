This was addressed by adding a recursion limit while decoding the packet.\n\n### ASA-2024-0013\n\nNested messages in a transaction can consume exponential cpu and memory on `UnpackAny` calls.  The`max_tx_bytes` sets a limit for external TX but is not applied for internal messages emitted by wasm contracts or a malicious validator block. This may result in a node crashing due to resource exhaustion.  This was addressed by adding additional validation to prevent this condition.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issues above are resolved in Cosmos SDK versions v0.47.15 or v0.50.11.\nPlease upgrade ASAP.\n\n### Timeline for ASA-2024-0012\n\n* October 1, 2024, 12:29pm UTC: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* October 1, 2024, 2:47pm UTC: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* December 9, 2024, 11:13am UTC: Core team completes patch for issue\n* Dec 14, 2024,16:00 UTC: Pre-notification delivered\n* Dec 16, 2024, 16:00 UTC: Patch made available\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on October 1, 2024.\n\n### Timeline for ASA-2024-0013\n\n* October 19, 2024, 8:12pm UTC: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* October 19, 2024, 8:28pm UTC: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* December 11, 2024, 3:31pm UTC: Core team completes patch for issue\n* Dec 14, 2024, 16:00 UTC: Pre-notification delivered\n* Dec 16, 2024, 16:00 UTC: Patch made available\n\nThis issue was reported by LonelySloth to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on October 19, 2024. \n\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a bug, please see https://hackerone.com/cosmos.\n\nIf you have questions about Interchain security efforts, please reach out to our official communication channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io).
