    "Description": "### Impact\nThis issue represents a potential PII concern.  If applications were printing or logging a context containing gRPC metadata, the affected versions will contain all the metadata, which may include private information.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue first appeared in 1.64.0 and is patched in 1.64.1 and 1.65.0\n\n### Workarounds\nIf using an affected version and upgrading is not possible, ensuring you do not log or print contexts will avoid the problem.\n",
