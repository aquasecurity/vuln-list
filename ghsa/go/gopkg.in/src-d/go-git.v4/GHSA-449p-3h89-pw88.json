    "Description": "### Impact\nA path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.11`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.\n\nApplications are only affected if they are using the [ChrootOS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS), which is the default when using \"Plain\" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using [BoundOS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS) or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.\nThis is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli.\n\n### Patches\nUsers running versions of `go-git` from `v4` and above are recommended to upgrade to `v5.11` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn cases where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible in a timely manner, we recommend limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.\n\n## Credit\nThanks to Ionut Lalu for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability to us.",
