    "Description": "A Helm contributor discovered that a specially crafted chart archive file can cause Helm to use all available memory and have an out of memory (OOM) termination.\n\n### Impact\nA chart archive file can be crafted in a manner where it expands to be significantly larger uncompressed than compressed (e.g., \u003e800x difference). When Helm loads this specially crafted chart, memory can be exhausted causing the application to terminate.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been resolved in Helm v3.17.3.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that any chart archive files being loaded by Helm do not contain files that are large enough to cause the Helm Client or SDK to use up available memory leading to a termination.\n\n### For more information\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n\n### Credits\nDisclosed by Jakub Ciolek at AlphaSense.",
