    "Description": "The Helm core maintainers have identified a high severity security vulnerability in Go's `crypto` package affecting all versions prior to Helm 2.16.8 and Helm 3.1.0.\n\nThanks to @ravin9249 for identifying the vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\nGo before 1.12.16 and 1.13.x before 1.13.7 (and the `crypto/cryptobyte` package before 0.0.0-20200124225646-8b5121be2f68 for Go) allows attacks on clients resulting in a panic via a malformed X.509 certificate. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch to compile Helm against Go 1.14.4 has been provided for Helm 2 and is available in Helm 2.16.8. Helm 3.1.0 and newer are compiled against Go 1.13.7+.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround is available. Users are urged to upgrade.\n\n### References\n\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7919\n- https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/8288\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [the Helm repository](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues)\n* For security-specific issues, email us at \u003ccncf-helm-security@lists.cncf.io\u003e",
