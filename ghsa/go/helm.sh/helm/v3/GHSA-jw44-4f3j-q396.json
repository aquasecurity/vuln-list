    "Description": "### Withdrawn Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the issue describes intended behavior and the output is not exposed to unauthorized users. This link has been maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Helm. It displays values of secrets when the --dry-run flag is used. This is a security concern in some use cases, such as a --dry-run call by a CI/CD tool. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed without breaking backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values).",
