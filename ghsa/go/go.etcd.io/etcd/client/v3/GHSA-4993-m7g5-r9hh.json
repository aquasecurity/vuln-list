    "Description": "### Vulnerability type\nAccess Control\n\n### Workarounds\nThe etcdctl and etcd API do not enforce a specific password length during user creation or user password update operations. [It is the responsibility of the administrator to enforce these requirements](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/authentication.md#notes-on-password-strength).\n\n### Detail\netcd does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force usersâ€™ passwords with little computational effort.\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md#product-security-committee-psc)",
