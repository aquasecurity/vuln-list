    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen running processes using \"chroot\" isolation, the process being run can examine the environment variables of its immediate parent and grandparent processes (CVE-2021-3602).  This isolation type is often used when running `buildah` in unprivileged containers, and it is often used to do so in CI/CD environments.  If sensitive information is exposed to the original `buildah` process through its environment, that information will unintentionally be shared with child processes which it starts as part of handling RUN instructions or during `buildah run`.  The commands that `buildah` is instructed to run can read that information if they choose to.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade packages, or images which contain packages, to include version 1.21.3 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs a workaround, invoking `buildah` in a container under `env -i` to have it started with a reinitialized environment should prevent the leakage.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues)\n* Email us at [the buildah general mailing list](mailto:buildah@lists.buildah.io), or [the podman security mailing list](mailto:security@lists.podman.io) if it's sensitive.",
