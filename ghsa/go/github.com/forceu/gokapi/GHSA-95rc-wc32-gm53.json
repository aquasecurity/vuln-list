    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen using end-to-end encryption, a stored XSS vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with JavaScript code embedded in the filename. After upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed.\n\nWith the affected versions \u003cv2.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users with \u003cv2.0. Nethertheless with XSS, other attack vectors like redirection or crypto mining would be possble.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis CVE has been fixed in v2.0.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are the only authenticated user using Gokapi, you are not affected. A workaround would be to disable end-to-end encryption.",
