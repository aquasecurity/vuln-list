    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe Manager disables TLS certificate verification in two HTTP clients (figures 3.1 and 3.2). The clients are not configurable, so users have no way to re-enable the verification.\n\n```golang\nfunc getAuthToken(ctx context.Context, header http.Header) (string, error) { [skipped]\n       client := \u0026http.Client{\n             Timeout: defaultHTTPRequesttimeout,\n             Transport: \u0026http.Transport{\n                    TLSClientConfig: \u0026tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true},\n             },\n}\n[skipped]\n}\n```\n\nA Manager processes dozens of preheat jobs. An adversary performs a network-level Man-in-the-Middle attack, providing invalid data to the Manager. The Manager preheats with the wrong data, which later causes a denial of service and file integrity problems.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nA third party security audit was performed by Trail of Bits, you can see the [full report](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf).\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com](mailto:dragonfly-maintainers@googlegroups.com).",
