    "Description": "### Impact\n\nOpenBao's audit log experienced a regression wherein raw HTTP bodies used by few endpoints were not correctly redacted (HMAC'd).  This impacted the following subsystems:\n\n - When using the ACME functionality of PKI, this would result in short-lived ACME verification challenge codes being leaked in the audit logs.\n - When using the OIDC issuer functionality of the identity subsystem, auth and token response codes along with claims could be leaked in the audit logs.\n\nThird-party plugins may be affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nOpenBao v2.4.2 will patch this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf users do not use the above functionality, they are not impacted. ACME verification codes are not usable after verification or challenge expiry so are of limited long-term use.",
