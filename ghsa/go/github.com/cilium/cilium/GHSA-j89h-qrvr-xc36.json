    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies:\n\n- Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted\n- Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted\n\n**Note:** For clusters running in native routing mode, IPsec encryption is not applied to connections which are selected by a L7 Egress Network Policy or a DNS Policy. This is a known limitation of Cilium's IPsec encryption which will continue to apply after upgrading to the latest Cilium versions described below.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects: \n\n- Cilium v1.15 before v1.15.2\n- Cilium v1.14 before v1.14.8\n- Cilium v1.13 before v1.13.13\n- Cilium v1.4 to v1.12 inclusive\n\nThis issue has been resolved in:\n\n- Cilium v1.15.2\n-  Cilium v1.14.8\n-  Cilium v1.13.13\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @jschwinger233, @julianwiedmann, @giorio94, and @jrajahalme for their work in triaging and resolving this issue.   \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability in Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our private security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list that only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.",
