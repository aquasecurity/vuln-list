    "Description": "### Impact\n\nFor Cilium users who are using CRDs to store Cilium state (the default configuration) and [Wireguard transparent encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/#encryption-wg), responses from pods to the Ingress and health endpoints are not encrypted. Traffic from the Ingress and health endpoints to pods is not affected by this issue. The health endpoint is only used for Cilium's internal health checks.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects Cilium v1.14 before v1.14.7.\n\nThis issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.7.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround to this issue - affected users are encouraged to upgrade.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @gandro for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and your report will be treated as top priority.\n",
