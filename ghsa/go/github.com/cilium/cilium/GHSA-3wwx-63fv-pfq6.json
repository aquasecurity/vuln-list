    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA policy rule denying a prefix that is broader than /32 may be ignored if there is\n\n- A policy rule referencing a more narrow prefix (`CIDRSet` or `toFQDN`) **and**\n- This narrower policy rule specifies either `enableDefaultDeny: false` or `- toEntities: all`\n\nNote that a rule specifying `toEntities: world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.\n\nAs an example, given the below policies, traffic is allowed to 1.1.1.2, when it should be denied:\n\n```\napiVersion: cilium.io/v2\nkind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: block-scary-range\nspec:\n  endpointSelector: {}\n  egressDeny:\n  - toCIDRSet:\n    - cidr: 1.0.0.0/8\n\n---\n\napiVersion: cilium.io/v2\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: evade-deny\nspec:\n  endpointSelector: {}\n  egress:\n  - toCIDR:\n    - 1.1.1.2/32\n  - toEntities:\n    - all\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n- Cilium v1.14 between v1.14.0 and v1.14.15 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.9 inclusive\n\nThis issue has been patched in:\n\n- Cilium v1.14.16\n- Cilium v1.15.10\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers with policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false` can work around this issue by removing this configuration option and explicitly defining any allow rules required.\n\nNo workaround is available to users with egress policies that explicitly specify `toEntities: all`.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @squeed, @christarazi, and @jrajahalme for their work in triaging and resolving this issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated with top priority.\n",
