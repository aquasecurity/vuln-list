    "Description": "### Impact\nThe sflow decode package prior to version 3.4.4 does not employ sufficient packet sanitisation which can lead to a denial of service attack. Attackers can craft malformed packets causing the process to consume huge amounts of memory resulting in a denial of service.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngithub.com/cloudflare/goflow/v3/decoders/sflow\n\n### Patches\nVersion 3.4.4 contains patches fixing this.\n\n### Workarounds\nA possible workaround is to not have your goflow collector publicly reachable.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [goflow repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/goflow)\n* Email us [netdev[@]cloudflare.com ](mailto:netdev@cloudflare.com)\n",
