    "Description": "# Description\n\n[An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw) that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain.\n\nThis an upstream dependency used in cheqd-node, rather than a custom module.\n\n## Impact\nCould result in a chain halt.\n\n## Patches\nValidators, full nodes, and IBC relayers should upgrade to **[cheqd-node v3.1.7](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v3.1.7)**. This upgrade does not require a software upgrade proposal on-chain and is meant to be non state-breaking.\n\n## References\nSee [ASA-2025-004: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw) upstream on IBC-Go.",
