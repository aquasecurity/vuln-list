    "Description": "### Impact\nTwo malicious build steps running in parallel sharing the same cache mounts with subpaths could cause a race condition that can lead to files from the host system being accessible to the build container.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in v0.12.5\n\n### Workarounds\nAvoid using BuildKit frontend from an untrusted source or building an untrusted Dockerfile containing cache mounts with `--mount=type=cache,source=...` options.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/05/28/1\n",
