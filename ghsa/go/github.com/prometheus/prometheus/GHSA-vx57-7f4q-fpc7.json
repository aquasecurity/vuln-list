    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /.\nDue to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint.\n\nIf a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address (e.g.: `http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/new\u003curl\u003e`), they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL.\n\ne.g. if a user visits http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp://www.google.com/, they will be redirected to http://google.com.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue will be patched in 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases.\nIn 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.\n\nNote: Users who use a `--web.external-url=` flag _with a path_ (e.g.  `--web.external-url=http://example.com/prometheus`) are not affected.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please use our community channels (https://prometheus.io/community).\nOur security policy is available at https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/security/",
