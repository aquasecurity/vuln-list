This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA stored, DOM based, cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Prometheus before version 2.7.1. An attacker could exploit this by convincing an authenticated user to visit a crafted URL on a Prometheus server, allowing for the execution and persistent storage of arbitrary scripts.",
