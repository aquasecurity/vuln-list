    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA vulnerability has been identified which enables [Standard users](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/global-permissions) or above to elevate their permissions to Administrator in the `local` cluster.\n\nThe `local` cluster means the cluster where Rancher is installed. It is named `local` inside the list of clusters in the Rancher UI.\n\nStandard users could leverage their existing permissions to manipulate Kubernetes secrets in the `local` cluster, resulting in the secret being deleted, but their read-level permissions to the secret being preserved. When this operation was followed-up by other specially crafted commands, it could result in the user gaining access to tokens belonging to service accounts in the `local` cluster.\n\nUsers that have custom global roles which grant `create` and `delete` permissions on `secrets` would also be able to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nUsers with [audit logs enabled](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log#enabling-api-audit-log) in Rancher can try to identify possible abuses of this issue by going through the logs. To sieve through the data filter by `kind: Secret` with `type: provisioning.cattle.io/cloud-credential`, then investigate all log entries that affect that specific resource. A secondary check would be to filter by all operations with `Opaque` Secrets within the `cattle-global-data` namespace.\n\nAfter patching, it is recommended that users review access methods to Rancher (including RBAC policies, tokens, and host-level node access), to ensure that no changes were made to persist access to users who have leveraged this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases `2.6.13`, `2.7.4` and later versions. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).",
