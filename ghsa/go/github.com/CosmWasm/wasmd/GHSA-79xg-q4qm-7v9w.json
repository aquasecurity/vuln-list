    "Description": "# CWA-2025-006: Improper error handling may lead to IBC channel opening despite error\n\n**Severity**\n\nHigh (Considerable + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmd 0.60.0\n- wasmd \u003e= 0.51.0 \u003c 0.55.1\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmd 0.60.1, 0.55.1, 0.54.1, 0.53.3\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nA contract erroring during IBC channel opening does not prevent the channel from opening.\n\n## Applying the patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.\nIf you already use the latest / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.60.1 (Cosmos SDK 0.53 compatible), 0.55.1 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible), 0.54.1 or 0.53.3; `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.60.1, 0.55.1, 0.54.1 or 0.53.3.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nThe patch is consensus breaking.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis problem was discovered during an audit of the CosmWasm stack performed by Sherlock and funded by ICF/ICL in Q1 2025. Thank you for that work!\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see \u003chttps://hackerone.com/cosmos\u003e.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2025-03-03: Auditor informs Confio about this issue.\n- 2025-04-10: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2025-06-05: Upcoming patch is announced.\n- 2025-06-10: Patch is released.\n\n[^1]: following Amulet's Severity Classification Framework ACMv1.2: \u003chttps://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/0295254e8645301ccb606d46108a45cede0a73e0/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md\u003e",
