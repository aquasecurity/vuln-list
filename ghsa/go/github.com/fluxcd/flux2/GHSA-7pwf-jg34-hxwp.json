    "Description": "The kustomize-controller enables the use of Kustomizeâ€™s functionality when applying Kubernetes declarative state onto a cluster. A malicious user can use a specially crafted `kustomization.yaml` to cause Denial of Service at controller level.\n\nIn multi-tenancy deployments this can lead to multiple tenants not being able to apply their Kustomizations until the malicious `kustomization.yaml` is removed and the controller restarted.\n\n### Impact\n\nWithin the affected versions, users with write access to a Flux source are able to craft a malicious `kustomization.yaml` file which causes the controller to enter an endless loop.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0 released on 2022-04-20. The changes introduce better handling of Kustomization files blocking references that could lead to endless loops.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe Flux engineering team found and patched this vulnerability.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open an issue in the [flux2 repository](http://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).",
