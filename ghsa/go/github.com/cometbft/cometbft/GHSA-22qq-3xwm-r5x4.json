    "Description": "Name: ASA-2025-001: Malicious peer can disrupt node's ability to sync via blocksync\nComponent: CometBFT\nCriticality: Medium (Considerable Impact; Possible Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: \u003c= v0.38.16, v1.0.0\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes\n\n### Impact\n\nA malicious peer may be able to interfere with a node's ability to sync blocks with peers via the blocksync mechanism. \n\nIn the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights:\n\n```\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1000}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1001}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1002}\n...\n```\n\nIf `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights.\n\nThe existing code hovewer doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X \u003e Y`. For example:\n\n```\nB: {base: 100, latest: 2000}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1001}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1002}\n...\n```\n\n`A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. Even if `B` disconnects, the `latest` height (target height) won't be recalculated because `A` \"doesn't know where 2000\" came from per see.\n\n#### Impact Qualification\n\nThis condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting a non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v1.0.1](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and [v0.38.17](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17) fix this issue.\n\nUnreleased code in the main is patched as well.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen the operator notices `blocksync` is stuck, they can identify the peer from which that message with \"invalid\" height was received. This may require increasing the logging level of the `blocksync` module. This peer can then be subsequently banned at the p2p layer as a temporary mitigation.\n\n### References\n\nIf you have questions about Interchain security efforts, please reach out to our official communication channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io).
