    "Description": "# Impact\n\nThere exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse.\n\n# Details\n\nIf you have a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header `Important-Security-Header`, then sending a request with the following Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request was sent:\n\n```\ncurl 'https://example.com' -H \"Connection: Important-Security-Header\" -0\n```\n\nIn this case, the backend does not see the request header `Important-Security-Header`.\n\n# Patches\n\nTraefik v2.4.x: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.13\n\n# Workarounds\n\nNo.\n\n# For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).\n",
