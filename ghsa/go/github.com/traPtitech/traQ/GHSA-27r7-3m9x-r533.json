    "Description": "### Impact\nA vulnerability exists where sensitive information, such as OAuth tokens, is recorded in log files when an error occurs during the execution of an SQL query.\nAn attacker could intentionally trigger an SQL error by methods such as placing a high load on the database. This could allow an attacker who has the authority to view the log files to illicitly acquire the recorded sensitive information.\n\n### Patch\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in the following pull request:\n\nhttps://github.com/traPtitech/traQ/pull/2787\n\nIt is possible that OAuth tokens issued before the patch was applied have already been recorded in the logs. To completely eliminate the security risk, server administrators are strongly recommended to revoke all existing OAuth tokens.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you cannot apply the update immediately, as a temporary workaround, please review access permissions for SQL error logs and strictly limit access to prevent unauthorized users from viewing them.",
