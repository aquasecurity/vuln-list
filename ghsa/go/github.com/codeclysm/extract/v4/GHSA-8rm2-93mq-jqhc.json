    "Description": "### Impact\nA maliciously crafted archive may allow an attacker to create a symlink outside the extraction target directory.\n\n### Patches\nPlease use version 4.0.0 or later `github.com/codeclysm/extract/v4`. Any previous version is affected by the bug.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo knows workarounds.\n\n### Backward compatibility notes about upgrading to `/v4` from `/v3`\n\nIf you're not using the `extract.Extractor.FS` interface, you will not face any breaking changes and upgrading should be as simple as changing the import to `/v4`. This should be the case for most of the userbase.\n\nIf you're using the `Extractor.FS` interface, then upgrading to `/v4` will require to implement the new methods that have been added:\n\n```go\ntype FS interface {\n    Link(string, string) error\n    MkdirAll(string, os.FileMode) error\n    OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm os.FileMode) (*os.File, error)\n    Symlink(string, string) error\n\n    // The following methods have been added in the /v4 interface:\n\n    Remove(path string) error\n    Stat(name string) (os.FileInfo, error)\n    Chmod(name string, mode os.FileMode) error\n}\n```\n\nThere should be no other breaking changes in the `/v4` API.\n",
