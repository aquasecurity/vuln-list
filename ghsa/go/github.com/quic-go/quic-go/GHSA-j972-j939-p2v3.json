    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client.\n\nIn order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference.\n\n### Patches\n\nv0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability.\n\nThis release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue has been reported publicly, but without any context, in https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/4981.",
