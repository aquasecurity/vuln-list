    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images. \n\n### Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank [David Korczynski](https://github.com/DavidKorczynski) and [Adam Korczynski](https://github.com/AdamKorcz) of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md) during a security fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\n\nTo report a security issue in containerd:\n* [Report a new vulnerability](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/new)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)",
