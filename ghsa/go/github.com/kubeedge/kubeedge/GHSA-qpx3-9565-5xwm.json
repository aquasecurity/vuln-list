    "Description": "### Impact\nThe CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service.\nOnly an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below.\n```\nmodules:\n  ...\n  router:\n    enable: true\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable the router module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n### References\nNA\n\n### Credits\nThanks David Korczynski and Adam Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [kubeedge security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy) during a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [KubeEdge repo](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/new/choose)\n* To make a vulnerability report, email your vulnerability to the private [cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-kubeedge-security@lists.cncf.io) list with the security details and the details expected for [KubeEdge bug reports](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).\n",
