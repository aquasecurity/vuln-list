    "Description": "### Impact\nOn Windows, if `git-sizer` is run against a non-bare repository, and that repository has an executable called `git.exe`, `git.bat`, etc., then that executable might be run by `git-sizer` rather than the system `git` executable. An attacker could try to use social engineering to get a victim to run `git-sizer` against a hostile repository and thereby get the victim to run arbitrary code.\n\nOn Linux or other Unix-derived platforms, a similar problem could occur if the user's `PATH` has the current directory before the path to the standard `git` executable, but this is would be a very unusual configuration that has been known for decades to lead to all kinds of security problems.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should update to git-sizer v1.4.0\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are on Windows, then either\n* Don't run `git-sizer` against a repository that might contain hostile code, or, if you must…\n* Run `git-sizer` against a bare clone of the hostile repository, or, if that is not possible…\n* Make sure that the hostile repository doesn't have an executable in its top-level directory before running `git-sizer`.\n\nIf you are on Linux or other Unix-based system, then (for myriad reasons!) don't add the current directory to your `PATH`.\n\n### References\n* [Command PATH security in Go](https://blog.golang.org/path-security)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the `git-sizer` project](https://github.com/github/git-sizer).\n* Email us at [GitHub support](mailto:support@github.com).",
