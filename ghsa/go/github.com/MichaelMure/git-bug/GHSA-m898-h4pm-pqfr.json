    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe go language recently addressed a security issue in the way that binaries are found before being executed. Some operating systems like Windows persist to have the current directory being part of the default search path, and having priority over the system-wide path.\n\nThis means that it's possible for a malicious user to craft for example a `git.bat` command, commit it and push it in a repository. Later when git-bug search for the git binary, this malicious executable can take priority  and be executed.\n\n### Who is impacted\n\nThis issue happen on Windows and some other operating systems with a badly configured PATH.\n\nAll version prior to 0.7.2 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 0.7.2 fix this issue. Users should update as soon as possible.\n\n### References\n\nMore details about this issue can be found [here](https://blog.golang.org/path-security).",
