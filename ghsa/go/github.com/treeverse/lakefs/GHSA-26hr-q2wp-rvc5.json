    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen lakeFS is configured with **ALL** of the following:\n\n- Configuration option `auth.encrypt.secret_key` passed through environment variable\n- Actions enabled via configuration option `actions.enabled` (default enabled)\n\nthen a user who can configure an action can impersonate any other user.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\n### Workarounds\n\n**ANY ONE** of these is sufficient to prevent the issue:\n\n* Do not pass `auth.encrypt.secret_key` through an environment variable.\n\n   For instance, Kubernetes users can generate the entire configuration as a secret and mount that.  This is described [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-a-secret).\n* Disable actions.\n* Limit users allowed to configure actions.\n\n",
