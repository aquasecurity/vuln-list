    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nAn unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass all authentication mechanisms in the Milvus Proxy component, gaining full administrative access to the Milvus cluster.\nThis grants the attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete data, and to perform privileged administrative operations such as database or collection management.\nAll users running affected Milvus versions are strongly advised to upgrade immediately.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\nThis issue has been fixed in the following versions:\n\t•\tMilvus 2.4.24\n\t•\tMilvus 2.5.21\n\t•\tMilvus 2.6.5\n\nUsers should upgrade to these patched versions or later to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nIf immediate upgrade is not possible, a temporary mitigation can be applied by removing the sourceID header from all incoming requests at the gateway, API gateway, or load balancer level before they reach the Milvus Proxy.\nThis prevents attackers from exploiting the authentication bypass behavior.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nThe following pull requests contain the fixes for the affected Milvus branches:\n\t•\t[Fix for 2.4 branch](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/45391)￼\n\t•\t[Fix for 2.5 branch](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/45383)￼\n\t•\t[Fix for 2.6 branch](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/45379)￼\n\nSpecial thanks to the Volcengine Milvus team at ByteDance(liumingzhe.5689@bytedance.com) for responsibly discovering, reporting, and coordinating the disclosure of this critical authentication bypass vulnerability with the Milvus maintainers.",
