    "Description": "### Summary\n\nIt seems that when running **goshs** without arguments it is possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. This was tested on version **1.0.4** of **goshs**. The command function was introduced in version **0.3.4**.\n\n### Details\n\nIt seems that the function ```dispatchReadPump``` does not checks the option cli ```-c```, thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets.\n\n### PoC\n\nUsed **websocat** for the POC:\n```bash\necho -e '{\"type\": \"command\", \"content\": \"id\"}' |./websocat 'ws://192.168.1.11:8000/?ws' -t\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThe vulnerability will only impacts goshs server on vulnerable versions.",
