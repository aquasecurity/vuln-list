    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIn vulnerable versions of Fleet, an attacker could craft a specially-formed SAML response to:\n\n- Forge authentication assertions, potentially impersonating legitimate users.\n- If Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning is enabled, the attacker could provision a new administrative user account.\n- If MDM enrollment is enabled, certain endpoints could be used to create new accounts tied to forged assertions.\n\nThis could allow unauthorized access to Fleet, including administrative access, visibility into device data, and modification of configuration. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is addressed in commit [fc96cc4](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/fc96cc4e91047250afb12f65ad70e90b30a7fb1c) and is available in Fleet version 4.64.2.\n\nThe following backport versions also address this issue: \n\n- 4.63.2\n- 4.62.4\n- 4.58.1\n- 4.53.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade is not possible, Fleet users should temporarily disable [single-sign-on (SSO)](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploy/single-sign-on-sso) and use password authentication.\n\n### Credit\n\nThank you @hakivvi, as well as Jeffrey Hofmann and Colby Morgan from the Robinhood Red Team for finding and reporting this vulnerability using our [responsible disclosure process](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Email us at security@fleetdm.com\n- Join #fleet in [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)",
