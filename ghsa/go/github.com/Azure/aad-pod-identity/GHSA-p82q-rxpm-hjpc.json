    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nThe [NMI](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/nmi/) component in AAD Pod Identity intercepts and validates token requests based on regex. In this case, a token request made with backslash in the request (example: `/metadata/identity\\oauth2\\token/`) would bypass the NMI validation and be sent to [IMDS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service?tabs=windows) allowing a pod in the cluster to access identities that it shouldn't have access to.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n- We analyzed this bug and determined that we needed to fix it. This fix has been included in AAD Pod Identity release [v1.8.13](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/releases/tag/v1.8.13)\n- If using the [AKS pod-managed identities add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity), no action is required. The clusters should now be running the `v1.8.13` release.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in [Azure/aad-pod-identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity)\n",
