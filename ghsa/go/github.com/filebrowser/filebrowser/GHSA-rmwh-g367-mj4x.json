    "Description": "## Summary\n\nURLs that are accessed by a user are commonly logged in many locations, both server- and client-side. It is thus good practice to never transmit any secret information as part of a URL. The *Filebrowser* violates this practice, since access tokens are used as GET parameters.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe *JSON Web Token (JWT)* which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give the attacker full access to the user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to.\n\n## Description\n\nSensitive information in URLs is logged by several components (see the following examples), even if access is protected by TLS.\n\n* The browser history\n* The access logs on the affected web server\n* Proxy servers or reverse proxy servers\n* Third-party servers via the HTTP referrer header\n\nIn case attackers can access certain logs, they could read the included sensitive data.\n\n## Proof of Concept ##\n\nWhen a file is downloaded via the web interface, the JWT is part of the URL:\n\n```http\nGET /api/raw/testdir/testfile.txt?auth=eyJh[...]_r4EQ HTTP/1.1\nHost: filebrowser.local:8080\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nConnection: keep-alive\nReferer: http://filebrowser.local:8080/files/testdir/\nCookie: auth=eyJh[...]_r4EQ\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nPriority: u=0, i\n```\n\nThis also happens when a new *command session* is started:\n\n```http\nGET /api/command/?auth=eyJh[...]YW8BA HTTP/1.1\nHost: filebrowser.local:8080\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nSec-WebSocket-Version: 13\nOrigin: http://filebrowser.local:8080\nSec-WebSocket-Key: oqQMrF7R34D3lAkj1+ZHTw==\nConnection: keep-alive, Upgrade\nCookie: auth=eyJh[...]YW8BA\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nUpgrade: websocket\n```\n\n## Recommended Countermeasures ##\n\nSensitive data like session tokens or user credentials should be transmitted via HTTP headers or the HTTP body only, never in the URL.\n\n## Timeline ##\n\n* `2025-03-27` Identified the vulnerability in version 2.32.0\n* `2025-04-11` Contacted the project\n* `2025-04-29` Vulnerability disclosed to the project\n* `2025-06-25` Uploaded advisories to the project's GitHub repository\n* `2025-06-26` CVE ID assigned by GitHub\n* `2025-06-26` Fix released in version 2.33.9\n\n## References ##\n\n* [CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html)\n* [Original Advisory](https://github.com/sbaresearch/advisories/tree/public/2025/SBA-ADV-20250327-03_Filebrowser_Sensitive_Data_Transferred_In_URL)\n\n## Credits ##\n\n* Mathias Tausig ([SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/))",
