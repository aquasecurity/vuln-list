    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIf you make use of the **report receiver server** (experimental), a client may be able to forge requests such that arbitrary files on the host can be overwritten (subject to permissions of the yapscan server), leading to loss of data. This is particularly problematic if you do not authenticate clients and/or run the server with elevated permissions.\n\n### Patches\n\nVulnerable versions:\n\n- v0.18.0\n- v0.19.0 (unreleased)\n\nThis problem is patched in version v0.19.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpdate to the newer version is highly encouraged!\n\nMeasures to reduce the risk of this include authenticating clients (see `--client-ca` flag) and containerization of the yapscan server.\n\n### References\n\nThe tracking issue is #35. There you can find the commits, fixing the issue.\n",
