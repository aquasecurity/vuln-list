    "Description": "### Impact\n\nDepending on implementation, a denial-of-service or privilege escalation vulnerability may occur in software that uses the `github.com/ecnepsnai/web` package with Web Sockets that have an AuthenticateMethod.\n\nThe `AuthenticateMethod` is not called, and `UserData` will be nil in request methods. Attempts to read the `UserData` may result in a panic.\n\nThis issue only affects web sockets where an `AuthenticateMethod` is supplied to the handle options. Users who do not use web sockets, or users who do not require authentication are not at risk.\n\n#### Example\n\nIn the example below, one would expect that the `AuthenticateMethod` function would be called for each request to `/example`\n\n```go\nhandleOptions := web.HandleOptions{\n\tAuthenticateMethod: func(request *http.Request) interface{} {\n\t\t// Assume there is logic here to check for an active sessions, look at cookies or headers, etc...\n\t\tvar session Session{} // Example\n\n\t\treturn session\n\t},\n}\n\nserver.Socket(\"/example\", handle, handleOptions)\n```\n\nHowever, the method is not called, and therefor the `UserData` parameter of the request object in the handle will be nil, when it would have been expected to be the `session` object we returned.\n\n### Patches\n\nRelease v1.5.2 fixes this vulnerability. The authenticate method is now called for websocket requests.\n\nAll users of the web package should update to v1.5.2 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou may work around this issue by making the authenticate method a named function, then calling that function at the start of the handle method for the websocket. Reject connections when the return value of the method is nil.",
