    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen the Contrast initializer is configured with a `CONTRAST_LOG_LEVEL` of `info` or `debug`, the workload secret is logged to `stderr` and written to Kubernetes logs. \n\nSince `info` is the default setting, this affects all Contrast installations that don't customize their initializers' log level.\n\nThe following audiences are **intended** to have access to workload secrets (see https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.7/architecture/secrets#workload-secrets):\n\n* Contrast Coordinator (can derive all workload secrets)\n* Contrast Initializer (obtains only the secret configured in the manifest)\n* Seedshare owner (can derive all workload secrets)\n* Workload owner (can update manifests to obtain secrets)\n\nThis vulnerability allows the following parties **unintended access** to workload secrets issued by a Coordinator:\n\n* Kubernetes users with `get` or `list` permission on `pods/logs`.\n* Others with read access to the Kubernetes log storage (most notably, the cloud provider).\n\nThis vulnerability **does not affect** scenarios where workload secrets are not used by the application (directly or with [secure persistence](https://docs.edgeless.systems/contrast/1.7/architecture/secrets#secure-persistence)). Applications designed for workload owner exclusion can't use workload secrets and are thus unaffected.\n\n### Patches\n\nN/A\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by adding an environment variable `CONTRAST_LOG_LEVEL=warn` to the initializer after running `contrast generate`, and then running `contrast generate` again.\n\n### References\n\nN/A",
