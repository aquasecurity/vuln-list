    "Description": "### Impact\n\nCilium allows outside actors (`world` entity) to directly access pods with their internal pod IP, even if they are not exposed explicitly (e.g. via `LoadBalancer`). A pod that does not authenticate clients and that does not exclude `world` traffic via network policy may leak sensitive data to an attacker _inside the cloud VPC_.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in [v2.16.3](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation/releases/tag/v2.16.3).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis network policy excludes all `world` traffic. It mitigates the problem, but will also block all desired external traffic. If vulnerable pods are known, a policy can be crafted to only firewall those instead (see also https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#access-to-from-outside-cluster).\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: \"from-world-to-role-public\"\nspec:\n  endpointSelector:\n    matchLabels: {}\n    #  role: public\n  ingressDeny:\n    - fromEntities:\n      - world\n```\n\n### References\n\nThe tracking bug for a Cilium-side fix is https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/25626. \n",
