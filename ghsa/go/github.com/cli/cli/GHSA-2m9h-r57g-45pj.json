    "Description": "### Summary\n\nA security vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could create or overwrite files in unintended directories when users download a malicious GitHub Actions workflow artifact through `gh run download`. \n\n### Details\n\nThis vulnerability stems from a GitHub Actions workflow artifact named `..` when downloaded using `gh run download`.  The artifact name and `--dir` flag are used to determine the artifactâ€™s download path.  When the artifact is named `..`, the resulting files within the artifact are extracted exactly 1 directory higher than the specified `--dir` flag value.\n\nIn `2.63.1`, `gh run download` will not download artifacts named `..` and `.` and instead exit with the following error message:\n\n```\nerror downloading ..: would result in path traversal\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation heightens the risk of local path traversal attack vectors exactly 1 directory higher than intended.\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\n\n1. Upgrade `gh` to `2.63.1`\n2. Implement additional validation to ensure artifact filenames do not contain potentially dangerous patterns, such as `..`, to prevent path traversal risks.",
