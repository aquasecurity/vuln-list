    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAn high-privileged user could create a Package referencing an arbitrarily large image containing that Crossplane would then parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available memory and therefore in the container being OOMKilled.\n\nThe impact is low due to the high privileges required to be able to create the Package and the eventually consistency nature of controller.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and 1.13.0, all the supported versions of Crossplane at the time of writing.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOnly using images from trusted sources and keeping Package editing/creating privileges to administrators only, which should be both considered already best practices.\n\n### References\n\nSee `ADA-XP-23-16` in the Security Audit's [report](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/ac8b24fe739c5d942ea885157148497f196c3dd3/security/ADA-security-audit-23.pdf).\n\n### Credits\n\nThis was reported as `ADA-XP-23-16` by @AdamKorcz and @DavidKorczynski from Ada Logic and facilitated by OSTIF as part of the Security Audit sponsored by CNCF.",
