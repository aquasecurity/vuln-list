    "Description": "`go-ipld-prime` is a series of Go interfaces for manipulating IPLD data and a Go module that contains the `go-ipld-prime/codec/json` codec.\n\n### Impact\n\nEncoding data which contains a `Bytes` kind Node will pass a `Bytes` token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect to receive `Bytes` tokens. Such an encoding should be treated as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes.\n\n**This only impacts uses of the \"json\" codec, \"dag-json\" is not impacted.** Use of \"json\" as a decoder is not impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in v0.19.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPrefer the \"dag-json\" codec which has the ability to [encode bytes](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/#bytes).\n\n### References\n\nSee fix in [#472](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472)",
