    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe issue only occurs when the `CLIENT SETINFO` command times out during connection establishment. The following circumstances can cause such a timeout:\n\n1. The client is configured to transmit its identity. This can be disabled via the `DisableIndentity` flag.\n2. There are network connectivity issues\n3. The client was configured with aggressive timeouts\n\nThe impact differs by use case:\n\n* **Sticky connections**: Rather than using a connection from the pool on-demand, the caller can stick with a connection. Then you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection.\n* **Pipelines**: All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses.\n* **Default connection pool usage without pipelining**: When used with the default [ConnPool](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/blob/8fadbef84a3f4e7573f8b38e5023fd469470a8a4/internal/pool/pool.go#L77) once a connection is returned after use with [ConnPool#Put](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/blob/8fadbef84a3f4e7573f8b38e5023fd469470a8a4/internal/pool/pool.go#L366) the read buffer will be checked and the connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is discarded.\n\n### Patches\nWe prepared a fix in https://github.com/redis/go-redis/pull/3295 and plan to release patch versions soon.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag `DisableIndentity` (BTW: We also need to fix the spelling.) to `true` when constructing the client instance.\n\n### Credit\n\nAkhass Wasti\nRamin Ghorashi\nAnton Amlinger\nSyed Rahman\nMahesh Venkateswaran\nSergey Zavoloka\nAditya Adarwal\nAbdulla Anam\nAbd-Alhameed\nAlex Vanlint\nGaurav Choudhary\nVedanta Jha\nYll Kelani\nRyan Picard",
