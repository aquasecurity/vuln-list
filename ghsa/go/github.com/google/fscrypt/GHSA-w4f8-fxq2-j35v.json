    "Description": "The bash completion script for `fscrypt` through v0.3.2 allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the `fscrypt` bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to v0.3.3 or above.\n\nFor more details, see [CVE-2022-25328](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25328).",
