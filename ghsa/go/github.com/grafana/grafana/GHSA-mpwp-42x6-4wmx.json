    "Description": "### Impact\nOn Nov. 2, during an internal security audit, we discovered that when the fine-grained access control beta feature is enabled and there is more than one organization in the Grafana instance, Grafana 8.0 introduced a mechanism which allowed users with the Organization Admin role to list, add, remove, and update usersâ€™ roles in other organizations in which they are not an admin.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 8.2.4\n\n### Workarounds\nAll installations between v8.0 and v8.2.3 that have fine-grained access control beta enabled and more than one organization should be upgraded as soon as possible. If you cannot upgrade, you should turn off the fine-grained access control using a [feature flag](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/enterprise/access-control/#enable-fine-grained-access-control/).\n\nGrafana Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability.\n\n### Reporting security issues\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com. This address can be used for all of Grafana Labs' open source and commercial products (including, but not limited to Grafana, Grafana Cloud, Grafana Enterprise, and grafana.com).
