    "Description": "### Impact\n\nMMR before version 1.3.5 is vulnerable to unbounded disk consumption, where an unauthenticated adversary can induce it to download and cache large amounts of remote media files.\n\nMMR's typical operating environment uses S3-like storage as a backend, with file-backed store as an alternative option. Instances using a file-backed store or those which self-host an S3 storage system are therefore vulnerable to a disk fill attack. Once the disk is full, authenticated users will be unable to upload new media, resulting in denial of service.\n\nFor instances configured to use a cloud-based S3 storage option, this could result in high service fees instead of a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\n\nMMR 1.3.5 introduces a new default-on \"leaky bucket\" rate limit to reduce the amount of data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does limit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data.\n\nOperators should note that the leaky bucket implementation introduced in MMR 1.3.5 requires the IP address associated with the request to be forwarded, to avoid mistakenly applying the rate limit to the reverse proxy instead. To avoid this issue, the reverse proxy should populate the `X-Forwarded-For` header when sending the request to MMR.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOperators may wish to lower the maximum file size they allow and implement harsh rate limits, though this can still lead to a large amount of data to be downloaded. \n\n### References\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#As_a_meter",
