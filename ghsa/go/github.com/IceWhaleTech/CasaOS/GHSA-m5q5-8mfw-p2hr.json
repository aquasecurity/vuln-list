    "Description": "### Impact\n\nUnauthenticated attackers can craft arbitrary JWTs and access features that usually require authentication and execute arbitrary commands as `root` on CasaOS instances.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem was addressed by improving the validation of JWTs in 705bf1f. This patch is part of CasaOS 0.4.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers should upgrade to CasaOS 0.4.4. If they can't, they should temporarily restrict access to CasaOS to untrusted users, for instance by not exposing it publicly.\n\n### References\n\n- 705bf1f\n- https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/security-vulnerabilities-in-casaos/\n",
