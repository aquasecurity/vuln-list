    "Description": "### Summary\n\nThe Casa OS Login page has disclosed the username enumeration vulnerability in the login page which was patched in `CasaOS  v0.4.7`.\n\n### Details\n\nIt is observed that the attacker can enumerate the CasaOS username using the application response. If the username is incorrect the application gives the error \"**User does not exist**\" with success code \"**10006**\", If the password is incorrect the application gives the error \"**User does not exist or password is invalid**\" with success code \"**10013**\".\n\n### PoC\n\n1. If the Username is invalid application gives \"User does not exist\" with success code \"**10006**\".\n\n![1](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService/assets/63414468/a6eb4321-b2f3-4fba-aa8e-e1d0fbf58187)\n\n2. If the Password is invalid application gives  \"**User does not exist or password is invalid**\" with success code \"**10013**\".\n\n![2](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService/assets/63414468/126eff54-eeb0-4ee6-bc46-695376b5e5cd)\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUsing this error attacker can enumerate the username of CasaOS.\n\n### The logic behind the issue\n\nThe logic behind the issue\nIf the username is incorrect, then throw an error  \"**User does not exist**\" with success code \"**10006**\", else throw an error \"**User does not exist or password is invalid**\" with success code \"**10013**\".\n\nThis condition can be vice versa like:\n\nIf the password is incorrect, then throw an error \"**User does not exist or password is invalid**\" with success code \"**10013**\", else throw an error  \"**User does not exist**\" with success code \"**10006**\".\n\n### Mitigation\nSince this is the condition we have to implement a single error which can be \"**Username/Password is Incorrect!!!**\" with single success code.",
