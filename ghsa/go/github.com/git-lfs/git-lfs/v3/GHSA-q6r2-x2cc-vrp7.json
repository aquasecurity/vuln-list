    "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host.  By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem exists in all previous versions and is patched in v3.6.1.  All users should upgrade to v3.6.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds known at this time.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53263\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-53263\n* https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v3.6.1\n* [git-lfs/git-lfs@0345b6f816](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/0345b6f816e611d050c0df67b61f0022916a1c90)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* For general questions, start a discussion in the Git LFS [discussion forum](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions).\n* For reports of additional vulnerabilities, please follow the Git LFS [security reporting policy](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/SECURITY.md).",
