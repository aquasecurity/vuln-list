    "Description": "### Summary\n_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server._\n\nAtlantis logs contains GitHub credentials (tokens `ghs_...`) when they are rotated. This enables an attacker able to read these logs to impersonate Atlantis application and to perform actions on GitHub.\n\nWhen Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables getting administration privileges on the organization.\n\nThis was reported in https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060 and fixed in https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667 . The fix was included in [Atlantis v0.30.0](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/tag/v0.30.0).\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\nWhile auditing the Kubernetes/Argo CD/Atlantis deployment of some company, the following set-up was encountered:\n\n- Most employees have read-only access to Argo CD, enabling them to see the health of deployed applications.\n- Atlantis was deployed as an Argo CD application.\n- Atlantis was used to manage the configuration of a GitHub organization (such as team members), using [Terraform's GitHub integration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest).\n\nAtlantis logs on Argo CD contained lines such as:\n\n```json\n{\"level\":\"debug\",\"ts\":\"2024-11-07T17:58:30.636Z\",\"caller\":\"vcs/gh_app_creds_rotator.go:58\",\"msg\":\"Refreshing git tokens for Github App\",\"json\":{}}\n{\"level\":\"debug\",\"ts\":\"2024-11-07T17:58:30.637Z\",\"caller\":\"vcs/gh_app_creds_rotator.go:64\",\"msg\":\"token ghs_[REDACTED]\",\"json\":{}}\n{\"level\":\"debug\",\"ts\":\"2024-11-07T17:58:30.637Z\",\"caller\":\"vcs/git_cred_writer.go:36\",\"msg\":\"git credentials file has expected contents, not modifying\",\"json\":{}}\n```\n\nThis enabled employees with read-only access to Argo CD to get administration privileges on the GitHub organization, compromising all repositories. As some repositories were used for Infrastructure-as-Code deployment (with Atlantis), this enabled the security auditors to get cluster admin privileges on most Kubernetes clusters.\n\nWhile the set-up \"most employees have read-only access to Argo CD\" can be seen as dangerous, this should not incur such security risk (cf. https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/). The main issue here was that the logs contained privileged GitHub tokens as they were obtained by Atlantis.\n\nThis issue was already reported  (https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060) and fixed (https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667) but no security advisory was published on https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/security and no CVE was assigned (https://app.opencve.io/cve/?\u0026vendor=runatlantis\u0026product=atlantis only lists [CVE-2022-24912](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24912), which is unrelated).\n\nCould you please publish a security advisory?\n\n### PoC\n_Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._\n\ncf. https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060 for more details.\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\n- This leaks sensitive GitHub tokens in the log files (CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).\n- This could enable anyone with log read access to compromiseGitHub organizations managed by Atlantis.\n- This impact at least users using Atlantis with Github application and integration.",
