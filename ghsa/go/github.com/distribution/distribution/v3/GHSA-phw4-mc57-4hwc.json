    "Description": "### Impact\n\nSystems running registry version \u003e `3.0.0-beta.1` with token authentication enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpdate to at least `v3.0.0-rc.3`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no way to work around this issue without patching if your system requires token authentication.\n\n### References\n\nThe issue lies in how the JWK verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches.\n\nHere's the problematic flow:\n\n1. An attacker generates their own key pair\n2. They create a JWT and include their public key in the JWK header\n3. They set the `kid` in the JWK to match one of the trusted keys' IDs (which they could potentially discover)\n4. They sign the JWT with their private key\n5. The registry only checks if the `kid` exists in the trusted keys map but then uses the attacker's public key from the JWK to verify the signature",
