    "Description": "### Impact\nA buffer that was used for inbound network traffic had no upper limit. Pion DTLS would buffer all network traffic from the remote user until the handshake completes or times out. An attacker could exploit this to cause excessive memory usage.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.4\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds available, upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.4\n\n### References\nThank you to [Juho Nurminen](https://github.com/jupenur) and the Mattermost team for discovering and reporting this. \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Pion DTLS](http://github.com/pion/dtls)\n* Email us at [team@pion.ly](mailto:team@pion.ly)\n",
