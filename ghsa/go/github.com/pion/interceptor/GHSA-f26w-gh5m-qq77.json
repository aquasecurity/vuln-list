    "Description": "### Impact\nPion Interceptor versions v0.1.36 through v0.1.38 contain a bug in a RTP packet factory that can be exploited to trigger a panic with Pion based SFU via crafted RTP packets, This only affect users that use pion/interceptor.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to v0.1.39 or later, which includes PR [#338](https://github.com/pion/interceptor/pull/338) which validates that: `padLen \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 padLen \u003c= payloadLength` and return error  on overflow, avoiding panic.\n\nIf upgrading is not possible, apply the patch from the pull request manually or drop packets whose P-bit is set but whose padLen is zero or larger than the remaining payload.\n\n### Workarounds\nAt the application layer, reject any RTP packet where:\n```\nhasPadding (P-bit field) == true  \u0026\u0026  (padLen == 0 || padLen \u003e packetLen – headerLen)\n```\n\nbefore passing it to Pion’s packet factories.\n\n### References\nCommit fixing the bug: https://github.com/pion/interceptor/commit/fa5b35ea867389cec33a9c82fffbd459ca8958e5\nPull request: https://github.com/pion/interceptor/pull/338\nIssue: https://github.com/pion/webrtc/issues/3148",
