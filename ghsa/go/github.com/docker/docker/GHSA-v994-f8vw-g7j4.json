    "Description": "## Impact\nA bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files using `docker cp` into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host’s filesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process.\n\n## Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers do not need to be restarted.\n\n## Workarounds\nEnsure you only run trusted containers.\n\n## Credits\nThe Moby project would like to thank Lei Wang and Ruizhi Xiao for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the ﻿[Moby security policy](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n## For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)\n* Email us at ﻿ security@docker.com ﻿ if you think you’ve found a security bug",
