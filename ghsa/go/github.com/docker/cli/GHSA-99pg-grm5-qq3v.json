    "Description": "## Impact\n\nA bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9.  Users should update to this version as soon as possible.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nEnsure that any configured `credsStore` or `credHelpers` entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the `PATH`.\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at security@docker.com if you think youâ€™ve found a security bug",
