    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings.  The vulnerability can be used to delete files and directories recursively on the host system.  This vulnerability can be combined with [`GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5`](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5) to overwrite files on the host system.\n\nIn order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by Wings.  Information on how the exploitation of this vulnerability works will be released on February 24th, 2023 in North America.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.4` of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.4`.\n\nAnyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.4` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.4`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone at this time.",
