    "Description": "### Impact\nThis is a high priority vulnerability and users must upgrade ASAP.\n\nThe signature component of the authorization may be invalid, which would mean that as a client you can use any arbitrary secret to upload objects given the user already has prior WRITE permissions on the bucket,\n\nPrior knowledge of access-key, and bucket name this user might have access to - and an access-key with a WRITE permissions is necessary.\n\nHowever with relevant information in place, uploading random objects to buckets is trivial and easy via `curl`\n\n### Patches\nYes https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/21103\n\n### Workarounds\nReject requests with `x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER` for now at LB layer, ask application users to use `STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`",
