    "Description": "### Impact\n\nFor optimizing the scalar multiplication algorithm in circuit for some curves, gnark uses fake-GLV algorithm in case the curve doesn't support true-GLV. For this to work, we need to compute the scalar decomposition using the Half GCD method in gnark-crypto. However, for some of the inputs the algorithm didn't converge quickly enough.\n\nIn case the prover accepts untrusted witness, it could lead to denial of service as the prover gets stuck in a very slowly converging loop.\n\nThanks to @feltroidprime for reporting the issue and proposing a fix.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in gnark-crypto commit https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/56600883e0e9f9b159e9c7000b94e76185ec3d0d. The dependency update is implemented in gnark commit https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/commit/68be6cede36e387ab760725beabd3c96cc94e6dc.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis update doesn't require recompiling the circuits as the issue is in the hint function. The users can update the gnark-crypto dependency to the fixed version.\n\n### References\n\n* See bug report https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/issues/1483\n* Fake GLV description https://ethresear.ch/t/fake-glv-you-dont-need-an-efficient-endomorphism-to-implement-glv-like-scalar-multiplication-in-snark-circuits/20394",
