    "Description": "## Overview\n\nWe have identified and addressed a security issue in the Nuclei project that affected users utilizing Nuclei as **Go code (SDK)** running **custom templates**. This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with payloads loading in `sandbox` mode.\n\n## Details\n\nIn the previous versions, there was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation. \n\nThis issue has been fixed in the latest release, v2.9.9. We have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if required.\n\nThe `-sandbox` option has been **deprecated** and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is disabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be optionally disabled by user. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively), and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\nThis issue affected all versions of Nuclei prior to v2.9.9.\n\n## Patches\n\nWe recommend all users upgrade to the latest version, [v2.9.9](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v2.9.9), which includes the security fix.\n\n### References\n\n- [patch](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/pull/3927)\n- [releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v2.9.9)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank **keomutchoiboi** who reported this issue to us via our security email, [security@projectdiscovery.io](mailto:security@projectdiscovery.io). We appreciate the responsible disclosure of this issue.",
