Calling Check API or ListObjects with a model that uses [conditions](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/conditions), and \n2. OpenFGA is configured with caching enabled (`OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED`), and \n3. Check API call or ListObjects API calls contain [contextual tuples](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-are-contextual-tuples) that include conditions.\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade to v1.8.3.
