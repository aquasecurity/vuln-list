    "Description": "### Overview\nOpenFGA v1.8.0 to v1.8.12 ( openfga-0.2.16 \u003c= Helm chart \u003c= openfga-0.2.31, v1.8.0 \u003c= docker \u003c= v.1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.\n\n\n### Am I Affected?\nIf you are using OpenFGA v1.8.0 to v1.8.12, specifically under the following conditions, you are affected by this authorization bypass vulnerability:\n- Calling Check API or ListObjects with an [authorization model](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-an-authorization-model) that has a relationship directly assignable by both [type bound public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) and [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets), and\n- There are check or list object queries with [contextual tuples](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/contextual-tuples) for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both [type bound public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) and [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets), and\n- Those contextual tuplesâ€™s user field is an userset, and\n- Type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade to v1.8.13. This upgrade is backwards compatible.\n\n### Acknowledgments\nOkta would like to thank @udyvish for discovering this vulnerability.",
