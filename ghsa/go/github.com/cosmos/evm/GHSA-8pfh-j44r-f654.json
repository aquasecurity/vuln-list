More information will be disclosed at a later point to ensure chains have time to safely upgrade.\n\n## Workarounds\nNo workarounds for chains that make use of static or dynamic precompiles. Upgrading is strongly recommended.\n\n## Testing\nTests are introduced in every affected version.\n\n## Credits\nSpecial thanks to @yihuang for the help on this issue.",
