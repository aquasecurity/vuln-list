    "Description": "### Summary \n\nAn issue was identified in the Interchain Security (ICS) module that could result in the slashing of a validator for an \"old\" equivocation. The height-base filter for consumer equivocation evidence introduced in [v2.4.0-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v2.4.0-lsm) was re-enabled. \n\n### Details \n\nICS [v2.4.0-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v2.4.0-lsm) introduced a height-base filter for consumer equivocation evidence. This feature enables a provider to set per consumer chain minimum heights for which cryptographic evidence is considered valid. The Cosmos Hub [v14 upgrade](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v14.1.0) bumped ICS to v2.4.0-lsm and also set the minimum evidence height for both `neutron-1` and `stride-1` consumer chains to their respective height at that time (see [PR](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/pull/2821)). As a result, \"older\" cryptographic evidence was no longer accepted by the Hub.\n\nThe Cosmos Hub [v15 upgrade](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v15.1.0) bumped ICS to [v3.3.3-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v3.3.3-lsm), which had the height-base filter for consumer equivocation evidence disabled. \n",
