    "Description": "Syncthing version 0.14.33 and older erronously versions symlinks when they are deleted. If a directory is then created with the same name, a file created in that directory, and the file deleted, it is moved into the symlink target. This can lead to symlink traversal resulting in arbitrary file overwrite.",
