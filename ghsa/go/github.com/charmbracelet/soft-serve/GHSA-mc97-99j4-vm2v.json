    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive SSH authentication is active, through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG. This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public key step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the keyboard-interaction mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting manipulated SSH requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This could potentially result in unauthorized access to the Soft Serve.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this issue. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo workaround this vulnerability without upgrading, users can _temporarily_ disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the `allow-keyless` setting.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/issues/389",
