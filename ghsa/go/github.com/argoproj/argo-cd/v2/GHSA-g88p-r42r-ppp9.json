    "Description": "### Summary\n\nA race condition in the repository credentials handler can cause the Argo CD server to panic and crash when concurrent operations are performed on the same repository URL.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability is located in numerous repository related handlers in the `util/db/repository_secrets.go` file. For example, in the `secretToRepoCred` function. The issue manifests as a concurrent map access panic:\n\n```\nconcurrent map read and map write\n...\ngoroutine 1104 [running]:\ngithub.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2/util/db.(*secretsRepositoryBackend).secretToRepoCred(0xc000e50ea8?, 0xc000c65540)\n        /go/src/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/util/db/repository_secrets.go:404 +0x31e\n```\n\nThe race condition occurs due to:\n1. Concurrent repository credential operations (create/update/delete) accessing the same map\n2. Kubernetes informer re-syncs happening simultaneously\n3. Background watchers updating the same secret data\n4. No mutex protection for map access\n\nA valid API token with `repositories` resource permissions (`create`, `update`, or `delete` actions) is required to trigger the race condition.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability causes the entire Argo CD server to crash and become unavailable. Attackers can repeatedly and continuously trigger the race condition to maintain a denial-of-service state, disrupting all GitOps operations. Default ArgoCD configuration is vulnerable.\n\nThe affected code was originally introduced in [PR #6103](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/6103) and released in [v2.1.0](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.0).\n\nThis data race was addressed by deep-copying the `Secret` objects before reading/writing.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was found, reported and fixed by:\n\n@thevilledev\n\nThe Argo team would like to thank him for his responsible disclosure and constructive communications during the resolve of this issue.",
