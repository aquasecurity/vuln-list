    "Description": "### Impact\n\nI can convince the UI to let me do things with an invalid Application.\n1. Admin gives me `p, michael, applications, *, demo/*, allow`, where `demo` can just deploy to the `demo` namespace\n2. Admin gives me AppProject `dev` which reconciles from ns `dev-apps`\n3. Admin gives me `p, michael, applications, sync, dev/*, allow`, i.e. no updating via the UI allowed, gitops-only\n4. I create an Application called `pwn` in `dev-apps` with project dev and sync the app with sources from git\n5. I change the Applicationâ€™s project to demo via kubectl or gitops (whichever mechanism my admins have given me, because it should be safe)\n6. I use the UI to edit the resource which should only be mutable via gitops\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\nv2.10.7 \nv2.9.12 \nv2.8.16\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\nJoin us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n\n### Credits\nThis vulnerability was found \u0026 reported by @crenshaw-dev (Michael Crenshaw)\n\nThe Argo team would like to thank these contributors for their responsible disclosure and constructive communications during the resolve of this issue\n",
