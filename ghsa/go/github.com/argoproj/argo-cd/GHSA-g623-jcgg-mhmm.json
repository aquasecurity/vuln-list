    "Description": "### Impact\n\n\"Local sync\" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git.\n\nAn improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is _not_ enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.\n\nThe bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has been patched in the following versions:\n\n* 2.10.3\n* 2.9.8\n* 2.8.12\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo immediately mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass, remove `applications, create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access is to upgrade to a patched version.\n\nBranch protection rules and review requirements are a great way to enforce security constraints in a GitOps environment, but they should be just one layer in a multi-layered approach. Make sure your AppProject and RBAC restrictions are as thorough as possible to prevent a review bypass vulnerability from permitting excessive damage.\n\n### References\n\n* [Argo CD RBAC documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/rbac/)\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd",
