    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens.\n\nOIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD.\n\nIf Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD.\n\nThis bug also increases the blast radius of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.0-rc5\n* v2.5.8\n* v2.4.20\n* v2.3.14\n\nThe patch introduces a new `allowedAudiences` to the OIDC config block. By default, the client ID is the only allowed audience. Users who _want_ Argo CD to accept tokens intended for a different audience may use `allowedAudiences` to specify those audiences.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n  oidc.config: |\n    name: Example\n    allowedAudiences:\n    - audience-1\n    - audience-2\n    - argocd-client-id  # If `allowedAudiences` is non-empty, Argo CD's client ID must be explicitly added if you want to allow it.\n``\n\nEven though [the OIDC spec requires the audience claim](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken), some tokens may not include it. To avoid a breaking change in a patch release, versions \u003c 2.6.0 of Argo CD will skip the audience claim check for tokens that have no audience. In versions \u003e= 2.6.0, Argo CD will reject all tokens which do not have an audience claim. Users can opt into the old behavior by setting an option:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n  oidc.config: |\n    name: Example\n    skipAudienceCheckWhenTokenHasNoAudience: true\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround besides upgrading.\n\n### Credits \n\nThe Argo CD team would like to express their gratitude to Vladimir Pouzanov (@farcaller) from Indeed, who discovered the issue, reported it confidentially according to our [guidelines](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability), and actively worked with the project to provide a remedy.
