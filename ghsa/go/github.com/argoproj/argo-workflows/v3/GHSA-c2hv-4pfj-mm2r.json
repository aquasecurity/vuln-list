    "Description": "### Summary\nAn attacker who has permissions to read logs from pods in a namespace with Argo Workflow can read `workflow-controller` logs and get credentials to the artifact repository.\n\n### Details\nAn attacker, by reading the logs of the workflow controller pod, can access the artifact repository, and steal, delete or modify the data that resides there. The `workflow-controller` logs show the credentials in plaintext.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1366\" alt=\"screen\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5642b2be-edcf-4050-bf47-747d05352698\" /\u003e\n\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with access to pod logs in the `argo` namespace can extract plaintext credentials from the `workflow-controller` logs and gain access to the artifact repository. This can lead to:\n- Data exfiltration – theft of sensitive or proprietary artifacts\n- Data tampering – modification of workflows or artifacts\n- Data destruction – deletion of stored artifacts, leading to potential loss of critical data or pipeline failure",
