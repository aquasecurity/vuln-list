    "Description": "### Summary\nSince #4787 the log output is printed on the INFO level, while previously it was logged on DEBUG. This means if the `go build` output is non-empty, goreleaser leaks the environment.\n\n### PoC\n* Create a Go project with dependencies, do not pull them yet (or run goreleaser later in a container, or delete `$GOPATH/pkg`).\n* Make sure to have secrets set in the environment\n* Make sure to not have `go mod tidy` in a before hook\n* Run `goreleaser release --clean`\n* Go prints lots of `go: downloading ...` lines, which triggers the \"if output not empty, log it\" line, which includes the environment.\n\n### Impact\nCredentials and tokens are leaked.",
