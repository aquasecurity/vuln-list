    "Description": "### Summary\nWhen building packages directly from source control, file permissions on the checked-in files are not maintained. \n\n### Details\nWhen building packages directly from source control, file permissions on the checked-in files are not maintained. When nfpm packaged the files (without extra config for enforcing its own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777).\n\n### PoC\nCreate a default nfpm structure. \n\nWithin the test folder, create 3 files named `chmod-XXX.sh`. Each script has file \npermissions set corresponding with their file names (`chmod-777.sh` = `chmod 777`). Below each \nfile and permissions can be seen.\n\n```console\n$ ls -lart test \ntotal 24\n-rwxrwxrwx   1 user  group   11 May 19 13:15 chmod-777.sh\n-rw-rw-rw-   1 user  group   11 May 19 13:16 chmod-666.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 user  group  160 May 19 13:19 .\n-rw-rw-r--   1 user  group   11 May 19 13:19 chmod-664.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x  10 user  group  320 May 19 13:29 ..\n```\n\nBelow is the snippet nfpm configuration file of the contents of the package. The test folder \nand files has no extra config for enforcing permissions. \n\n```yaml\ncontents:\n- src: foo-binary\n  dst: /usr/bin/bar\n- src: bar-config.conf\n  dst: /etc/foo-binary/bar-config.conf\n  type: config\n- src: test\n  dst: /etc/test/scripts\n```\n\nThe next step is to create a deb package.\n\n```console\n$ nfpm package -p deb # Create dep package\nusing deb packager...\ncreated package: foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb\n```\n\nWhen on a Ubuntu VM, install the foo package which was created\n\n```console\n$ sudo dpkg -i foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb # Installing deb package within Ubuntu\nSelecting previously unselected package foo.\n(Reading database ... 67540 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb ...\nUnpacking foo (1.0.0) ...\nSetting up foo (1.0.0) ...\n```\n\nLooking at `/etc/test/scripts` and viewing the permissions. Permissions are passed exactly the same as the source.\n\n```console\n$ ls -lart /etc/test/scripts\ntotal 20\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   11 May 22 12:15 chmod-777.sh\n-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root   11 May 22 12:16 chmod-666.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root   11 May 22 12:19 chmod-664.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 May 22 13:00 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May 22 13:00 .\n```\n\n\n## Solution\nTo prevent world-writable files from making it into the packages, add the ability to override the default permissions of packaged files using a umask config option in the packaging spec file. This feature in nfpm would allow applying a global umask across any files being packaged, therefore, with the correct configuration, preventing world-writable files without needing to list permissions on each and every file in the package\n\n\n### Impact\n\nVulnerability is https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nAnyone using nfpm for creating packages and not checking/setting file permissions before packaging could result in bad permissions for files/folders.",
