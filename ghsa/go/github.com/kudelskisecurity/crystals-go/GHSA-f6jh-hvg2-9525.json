    "Description": "### Impact\nOn some platforms, when an attacker can time decapsulation of Kyber on forged cipher texts, they could possibly learn (parts of) the secret key.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in https://github.com/kudelskisecurity/crystals-go/pull/21\n\n### Note\nThis library was written as part of a MsC student project in the Cybersecurity Team at Kudelski Security. It is not actively maintained anymore. It is only intended for research and testing. We discourage its use in any production environment. Kudelski Security does not use this library as part of their commercial offers or product. This has now been clarified on the project's README.\n\n### References\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/ldX0ThYJuBo\nhttp://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/",
