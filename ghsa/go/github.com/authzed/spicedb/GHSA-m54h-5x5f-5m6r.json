    "Description": "### Impact\nAny user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupResources request with 1.22.0 is affected.\n\nFor example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may.\n\nGenerally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be used to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release.\n\n### Workarounds\nAvoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions if using `1.22.0`. \n\n### Patches\nThe only affected release is [v1.22.0](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.0), and it is patched in [v1.22.2](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.2) (there is no v1.22.1 release, though there is a git tag).\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/1397\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb)\n* Ask a question in the [SpiceDB Discord](https://authzed.com/discord)\n",
