    "Description": "A security issue was identified in the NanoProxy project related to the `golang.org/x/crypto` dependency. The project was using an outdated version of this dependency, which potentially exposed the system to security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in subsequent updates.\n\nImpact:\nThe specific vulnerabilities in the outdated version of `golang.org/x/crypto` could include authorization bypasses, data breaches, or other security risks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system.\n\nResolution:\nThe issue has been fixed in NanoProxy by upgrading the `golang.org/x/crypto` dependency to version 0.31.0. Users are strongly encouraged to update their instances of NanoProxy to include this fix and ensure they are using the latest secure version of all dependencies.\n\nFixed Version:\n* `golang.org/x/crypto` upgraded to version 0.31.0.",
