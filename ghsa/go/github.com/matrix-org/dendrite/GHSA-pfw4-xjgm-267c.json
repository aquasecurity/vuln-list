    "Description": "### Impact\n\nEvents retrieved from a remote homeserver using `/get_missing_events` did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint.\n\nNote that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified.\n\nHomeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds.\n\n### Special thanks\n\nTulir Asokan, who spotted the issue originally.",
