    "Description": "### Impact\nAn argument injection vulnerability was discovered in `go-git` versions prior to `v5.13`. \n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary values to [git-upload-pack flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-upload-pack). This only happens when the `file` transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol that shells out to `git` binaries.\n\n### Affected versions\nUsers running versions of `go-git` from `v4` and above are recommended to upgrade to `v5.13` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn cases where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible, we recommend users to enforce restrict validation rules for values passed in the URL field.\n\n## Credit\nThanks to @vin01 for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability to us.",
