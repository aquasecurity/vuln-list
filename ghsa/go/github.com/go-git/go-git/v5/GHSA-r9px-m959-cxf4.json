    "Description": "### Impact\nA denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.13`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in `go-git` clients. \n\nThis is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli.\n\n### Patches\nUsers running versions of `go-git` from `v4` and above are recommended to upgrade to `v5.13` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn cases where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible, we recommend limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.\n\n## Credit\nThanks to Ionut Lalu for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability to us.",
