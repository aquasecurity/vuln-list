    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen using the recommended \"best-effort\" mode, Go-Landlock did not restrict the TCP bind() and connect() operations any more when they were requested.  This affects Go-Landlock users to whom both of the following conditions apply:\n\n* They use Landlock rulesets that are supposed to restrict networking (through `landlock.V4`, `landlock.V5`, or self-configured).\n* These Landlock rulesets are used in best-effort mode.\n\nTypically, affected code uses the Go-Landlock API like this (the crucial part being the combination of `V4`/`V5` and `.BestEffort()`):\n\n```\nerr := landlock.V5.BestEffort().Restrict(...)\n```\n\n* This is a bug in the Go-Landlock library and does not affect programs that use Landlock via C or other language bindings.\n* The bug only affects networking restrictions. File system restrictions continue to work as expected.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in: https://github.com/landlock-lsm/go-landlock/commit/fb3ad845df462d013f9c8a965c496617c6a5778b\nUsers should upgrade to: v0.0.0-20241013234402-fb3ad845df46\n\nGo package dependencies can be updated using `go get -u` from the project directory.\n\nProjects on Github might get notified by Dependabot, once this advisory is public.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\nCurrently none.\n\n[The existing users of Go-Landlock on Github](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/landlock-lsm/go-landlock/landlock?tab=importedby) have the following bugs filed:\n* https://github.com/Foxboron/ssh-the-planet/issues/1\n* https://github.com/ngergs/websrv/issues/15\n* https://github.com/pufferffish/wireproxy/issues/142",
