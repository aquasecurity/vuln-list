    "Description": "## Impact\n\nTrying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks.\nIf you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic.\n\nThis is caused by a bogus fanout parameter in the HAMT directory nodes.\nThis includes checks returned in [ipfs/go-bitfield GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r), as well as limiting the fanout to \u003c= 1024 (to avoid attempts of arbitrary sized allocations).\n\n## Patches\n- https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/91b3d39d33ef0cd2aff2c95d50b2329350944b68\n- https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/a4ed723727e0bdc2277158337c2fc0d82802d122\n\n## References\n\n* https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q264-w97q-q778\n* https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r\n",
