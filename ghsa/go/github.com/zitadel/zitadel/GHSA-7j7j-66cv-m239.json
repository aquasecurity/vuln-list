    "Description": "### Impact\nZITADEL provides users the possibility to use Time-based One-Time-Password (TOTP) and One-Time-Password (OTP) through SMS and Email.\n\nWhile ZITADEL already gives administrators the option to define a `Lockout Policy` with a maximum amount of failed password check attempts, there was no such mechanism for (T)OTP checks.\n\n### Patches\n2.x versions are fixed on \u003e= [2.50.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.50.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround since a patch is already available.\n\n### References\nNone\n\n### Questions\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Jack Moran and Ethan from zxsecurity and Amit Laish from GE Vernova for finding and reporting the vulnerability. \n",
