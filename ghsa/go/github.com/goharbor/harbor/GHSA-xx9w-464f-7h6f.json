    "Description": "### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating a robot account that\nbelongs to a project that the authenticated user doesn’t have access to. API call:\n\nPUT /robots/{robot_id}\n\nBy sending a request that attempts to update a robot account, and specifying a robot\naccount id and robot account name that belongs to a different project that the user\ndoesn’t have access to, it was possible to revoke the robot account permissions.\n\n### Patches\nThis and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to [Gal Goldstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gal-goldshtein/) and [Daniel Abeles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-abeles/) from [Oxeye Security](https://www.oxeye.io/) for reporting this issue.\n",
