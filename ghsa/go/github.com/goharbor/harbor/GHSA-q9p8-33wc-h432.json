    "Description": "### **Impact**\n\nHidde Smit from Cyber Eagle has discovered an User Enumeration flaw in Harbor. The issue is present in the \"/users\" api endpoint. This endpoint is supposed to be restricted to administrators. This restriction is able to be bypassed and information can be obtained via the \"search\" functionality.\n\nNon-administrator users (such as those created via self-registration) can list all usernames and user IDs by sending a GET request to /api/users/search with parameter \"username\" and value \"_\", as follows:\n\n`curl -X GET \"https://\u003chost\u003e/api/users/search?username=_\" -H \"accept: application/json\" --user \u003cuser\u003e:\u003cpassword\u003e`\n\nThe vulnerability was immediately fixed by the Harbor team and all supported versions were patched. With the patched versions of Harbor, the username is required for search and we have removed the support for querying by email.\n\n### **Patches**\nIf your product uses the affected releases of Harbor, update to either version 2.1.0 or 2.0.3 to fix this issue immediately\n\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.1.0\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.0.3\n\n### **Workarounds**\nThere is no workaround for this issue\n\n### **For more information**\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, contact cncf-harbor-security@lists.cncf.io\nView our security policy at https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/policy\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13794",
