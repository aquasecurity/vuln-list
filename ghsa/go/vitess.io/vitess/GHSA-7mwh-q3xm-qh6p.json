    "Description": "### Summary\n\nThe `/debug/querylogz` and `/debug/env` pages for `vtgate` and `vttablet` do not properly escape user input. The result is that queries executed by Vitess can write HTML into the monitoring page at will.\n\n### Details\n\nThese pages are rendered using `text/template` instead of rendering with a proper HTML templating engine.\n\n### PoC\n\nExecute any query where part of it is HTML markup, for example as part of a string. To make it easier to observe you might want to make sure the query takes a few seconds to complete, giving you time to refresh the status page. \n\nExample query that can trigger the issue:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE users\nSET\n    email = CONCAT(\"\u003cimg src=https://cataas.com/cat/says/oops\u003e\", users.idUser, \"@xxx\")\nWHERE\n    email NOT LIKE '%xxx%' AND email != \"demo@xxx.com\"\n```\n\nResult: \n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c583816b-157c-474e-bbed-152b3dc0372f)\n\n### Impact\n\nAnyone looking at the Vitess status page is affected. This would normally be owners / administrators of the Vitess cluster.\n\nAnyone that can influence what text show up in queries can trigger it. This would normally be pretty much everybody interacting with a system that uses Vitess as a backend.",
