    "Description": "### Impact\n\nPassword Pusher comes with a configurable rate limiter.  In versions prior to [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0), the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service.\n\nAdditionally, with the ability to bypass rate limiting, it also allows attackers to more easily execute brute force attacks.\n\n### Patches\n\nIn [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0), a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue.\n\nIf you are running a remote proxy, please see [this documentation](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies) on how to authorize the IP address of your remote proxy.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt is highly suggested to upgrade to at least [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0) to mitigate this risk.\n\nIf for some reason you cannot immediately upgrade, the alternative is that you can add rules to your proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.\n\n### References\n\nThe new settings are [configurable to authorize remote proxies](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies).\n\n### Credits\n\nThank you to [Positive Technologies](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/) for reporting and working with me to bring this CVE to the community with the associated fix.\n",
