    "Description": "### Impact\n\nVersion [0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.2.0) of the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). \n\nThis means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem. \n\nMalicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify the gemâ€™s files and change its behavior during runtime.\n\n### Patches\n* octopoller 0.3.0\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can use the previous version of the gem [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octopoller/versions/0.1.0). Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.\n\n",
