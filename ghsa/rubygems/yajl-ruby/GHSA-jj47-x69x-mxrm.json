    "Description": "_NOTE: A previous patch, 1.4.2, fixed the heap memory issue, but could still lead to a DoS infinite loop. Please update to version 1.4.3_\n\nThe 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl) contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs.\n\n### Details\n\nThe [reallocation logic at yajl_buf.c#L64](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/blob/7168bd79b888900aa94523301126f968a93eb3a6/ext/yajl/yajl_buf.c#L64) may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf-\u003ealloc into a small heap chunk.\n\nThese integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer.\n\nSubsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption.\n\n### Impact\n\nWe rate this as a moderate severity vulnerability which mostly impacts process availability as we believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution to be unlikely.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in yajl-ruby 1.4.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing large inputs to YAJL\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/blob/7168bd79b888900aa94523301126f968a93eb3a6/ext/yajl/yajl_buf.c#L64\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [yajl-ruby](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/issues)\n",
