    "Description": "### Impact\nPrior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly.\n\nFrom Rails:\n\n\u003e Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a bug in a webserver[1] or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a response is not notified of a close, ActionDispatch::Executor will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes.\n\nThe combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11.\n\nThis problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.\n\nSee: \nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 \nfor details about the rails vulnerability\n\nUpgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrade to Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.\n\nThe [Rails CVE](https://groups.google.com/g/ruby-security-ann/c/FkTM-_7zSNA/m/K2RiMJBlBAAJ?utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=footer\u0026pli=1) includes a middleware that can be used instead.\n\n### References\n\n* Rails CVE: [CVE-2022-23633](https://groups.google.com/g/ruby-security-ann/c/FkTM-_7zSNA/m/K2RiMJBlBAAJ?utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=footer\u0026pli=1)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [puma](https://github.com/puma/puma)\n* See our [security policy](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy)",
