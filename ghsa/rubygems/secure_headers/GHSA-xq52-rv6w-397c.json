    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIf user-supplied input was passed into `append/override_content_security_policy_directives`, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection.\n\nThis could be used to e.g. override a `script-src` directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins. The directives in `secure_headers` are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all come before `script-src`. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even if `SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT` was supplied.\n\nThe fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s.\n\n\u003e Duplicate script-src directives detected.  All but the first instance will be ignored.\n\nSee https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#parse-serialized-policy\n\n\u003e Note: In this case, the user agent SHOULD notify developers that a duplicate directive was ignored. A console warning might be appropriate, for example.\n\n### Patches\n\nDepending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user input into the above methods, you could filter out the input:\n\n```ruby\noverride_content_security_policy_directives(:frame_src, [user_input.gsub(\";\", \" \")])\n```\n\n### References\n\nReported in https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/issues/418\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#parse-serialized-policy\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [this repo](https://github.com/twitter/secure_headers/issues/new)\n* DM @ndm on twitter ",
