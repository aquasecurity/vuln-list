    "Description": "# Possible ReDoS vulnerability in Accept header parsing in Action Dispatch\n\nThere is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the Accept header parsing routines\nof Action Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier\nCVE-2024-26142.\n\nVersions Affected:  \u003e= 7.1.0, \u003c 7.1.3.1\nNot affected:       \u003c 7.1.0\nFixed Versions:     7.1.3.1\n\nImpact\n------\nCarefully crafted Accept headers can cause Accept header parsing in Action\nDispatch to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS\nvulnerability.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or\nuse one of the workarounds immediately.\n\nRuby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby\n3.2 or newer are unaffected.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for\nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a\nsingle changeset.\n\n* 7-1-accept-redox.patch - Patch for 7.1 series\n\nCredits\n-------\nThanks [svalkanov](https://hackerone.com/svalkanov) for the report and patch!",
