    "Description": "There is an XSS vulnerability in the `number_to_currency`, `number_to_percentage` and `number_to_human` helpers in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0081.\n\nVersions Affected:  All.\nFixed Versions:     4.1.0.beta2, 4.0.3, 3.2.17.\n\nImpact\n------\nThese helpers allows users to nicely format a numeric value. Some of the parameters to the helper (format, negative_format and units) are not escaped correctly. Applications which pass user controlled data as one of these parameters are vulnerable to an XSS attack.\n\nAll users passing user controlled data to these parameters of the number helpers should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe 4.1.0.rc1, 4.0.3 and 3.2.17 releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\n\nThe workaround for this issue is to escape the value passed to the parameter.\nFor example, replace code like this:\n\n```ruby\n\u003c%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: params[:format]) %\u003e\n```\n\nWith code like this\n\n```ruby\n\u003c%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: h(params[:format])) %\u003e\n```\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.1-beta series\n* 4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.0 series\n* 3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 3.2 series\n\nPlease note that only the 4.0.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to Kevin Reintjes for reporting the issue to us.\n\n-- \nAaron Patterson\nhttp://tenderlovemaking.com/\n",
