    "Description": "There is a possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability in Action View. This was meant to be fixed on CVE-2016-0752. However the 3.2 patch was not covering all possible scenarios. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-2097.\n\nVersions Affected:  3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x\nNot affected:       4.2+\nFixed Versions:     3.2.22.2, 4.1.14.2\n\nImpact\n------\nApplications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a controller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.\n\nImpacted code will look something like this:\n\n```ruby\ndef index\n  render params[:id]\nend\n```\n\nCarefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from unexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and can possibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nA workaround to this issue is to not pass arbitrary user input to the `render` method. Instead, verify that data before passing it to the `render` method.\n\nFor example, change this:\n\n```ruby\ndef index\n  render params[:id]\nend\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n```ruby\ndef index\n  render verify_template(params[:id])\nend\n\nprivate\ndef verify_template(name)\n  # add verification logic particular to your application here\nend\n```\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for it. It is in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 3-2-render_data_leak_2.patch - Patch for 3.2 series\n* 4-1-render_data_leak_2.patch - Patch for 4.1 series\n\nCredits\n-------\nThanks to both Jyoti Singh and Tobias Kraze from makandra for reporting this and working with us in the patch!",
