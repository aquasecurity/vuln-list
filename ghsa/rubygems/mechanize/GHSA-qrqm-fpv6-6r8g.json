    "Description": "This security advisory has been created for public disclosure of a Command Injection vulnerability that was responsibly reported by @kyoshidajp (Katsuhiko YOSHIDA).\n\n### Impact\n\nMechanize `\u003e= v2.0`, `\u003c v2.7.7` allows for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Exploitation is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these calls:\n\n- `Mechanize::CookieJar#load`: since v2.0 (see 208e3ed)\n- `Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as`: since v2.0 (see 5b776a4)\n- `Mechanize#download`: since v2.2 (see dc91667)\n- `Mechanize::Download#save` and `#save!` since v2.1 (see 98b2f51, bd62ff0)\n- `Mechanize::File#save` and `#save_as`: since v2.1 (see 2bf7519)\n- `Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body`: since v2.0 (see 01039f5)\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThese vulnerabilities are patched in Mechanize v2.7.7.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds are available. We recommend upgrading to v2.7.7 or later.\n\n\n### References\n\nSee https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_security.html#securityopen for background on why `Kernel.open` should not be used with untrusted input.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please open an issue in [sparklemotion/mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize/issues/new).",
