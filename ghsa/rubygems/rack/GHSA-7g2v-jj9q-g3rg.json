    "Description": "## Summary\n\n`Rack::CommonLogger` can be exploited by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen a user provides the authorization credentials via `Rack::Auth::Basic`, if success, the username will be put in `env['REMOTE_USER']` and later be used by `Rack::CommonLogger` for logging purposes.\n\nThe issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space characters, or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character, the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile.\n\n## Impact\n\nAttackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries, potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data into log files.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Update to the latest version of Rack.",
