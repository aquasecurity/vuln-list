    "Description": "## Summary\n\n`Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file.\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Update to the latest version of Rack, or\n- Remove usage of `Rack::Static`, or\n- Ensure that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly.\n\nIt is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.",
