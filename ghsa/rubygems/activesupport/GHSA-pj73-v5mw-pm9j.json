    "Description": "There is a vulnerability in ActiveSupport if the new bytesplice method is called on a SafeBuffer with untrusted user input.\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-28120.\n\nVersions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.3, 6.1.7.3\n\n# Impact\n\nActiveSupport uses the SafeBuffer string subclass to tag strings as html_safe after they have been sanitized.\nWhen these strings are mutated, the tag is should be removed to mark them as no longer being html_safe.\n\nRuby 3.2 introduced a new bytesplice method which ActiveSupport did not yet understand to be a mutation.\nUsers on older versions of Ruby are likely unaffected.\n\nAll users running an affected release and using bytesplice should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nAvoid calling bytesplice on a SafeBuffer (html_safe) string with untrusted user input.\n",
