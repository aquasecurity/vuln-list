    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe admin panel is subject to potential XSS attach in case the attacker manages to modify some records being uploaded to the server.\n\nThe attacker is able to change  e.g. to `\u003csvg onload=alert('XSS')\u003e` if they know how to craft these requests themselves. And then enter the returned blob ID to the form inputs manually by modifying the edit page source.\n\n### Patches\n\nAvailable in versions 0.27.6 and 0.28.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nReview the user accounts that have access to the admin panel (i.e. general Administrators, and participatory space's Administrators) and remove access to them if they don't need it. \n\n### References\n\nOWASP ASVS v4.0.3-5.1.3\n",
