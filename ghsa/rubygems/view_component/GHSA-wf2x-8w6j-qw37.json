    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a [`#call` method](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/templates.html#call) (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content.\n\nIn addition, the return value of the [`#output_postamble` method](https://viewcomponent.org/api.html#output_postamble--string) is not sanitized, which can also lead to XSS issues.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nVersions 3.9.0 has been released and fully mitigates both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nSanitize the return value of `#call`, eg:\n\n```ruby\nclass MyComponent \u003c ApplicationComponent\n  def call\n    html_escape(\"\u003cdiv\u003e#{user_input}\u003c/div\u003e\")\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nhttps://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1950\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in the [github/view_component](https://github.com/github/view_component) project.",
