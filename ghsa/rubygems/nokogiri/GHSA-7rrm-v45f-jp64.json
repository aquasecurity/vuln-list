    "Description": "### Summary\n\nNokogiri v1.11.4 updates the vendored libxml2 from v2.9.10 to v2.9.12 which addresses:\n\n- [CVE-2019-20388](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-20388) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2020-24977](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-24977) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3517](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3517) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3518](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3518) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3537](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3537) (Low severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3541](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3541) (Low severity)\n\nNote that two additional CVEs were addressed upstream but are not relevant to this release. [CVE-2021-3516](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3516) via `xmllint` is not present in Nokogiri, and [CVE-2020-7595](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-7595) has been patched in Nokogiri since v1.10.8 (see #1992).\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `\u003c 1.11.4`, and only if the packaged version of libxml2 is being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `\u003e= 1.11.4`.\n\n\n### Impact\n\nI've done a brief analysis of the published CVEs that are addressed in this upstream release. The libxml2 maintainers have not released a canonical set of CVEs, and so this list is pieced together from secondary sources and may be incomplete.\n\nAll information below is sourced from [security.archlinux.org](https://security.archlinux.org), which appears to have the most up-to-date information as of this analysis.\n\n#### [CVE-2019-20388](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-20388)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: A memory leak was found in the xmlSchemaValidateStream function of libxml2. Applications that use this library may be vulnerable to memory not being freed leading to a denial of service.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/7ffcd44d7e6c46704f8af0321d9314cd26e0e18a\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri \u003c v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2020-7595](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-7595)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: xmlStringLenDecodeEntities in parser.c in libxml2 2.9.10 has an infinite loop in a certain end-of-file situation.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/0e1a49c8907645d2e155f0d89d4d9895ac5112b5\n\nThis has been patched in Nokogiri since v1.10.8 (see #1992).\n\n\n#### [CVE-2020-24977](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-24977)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Information disclosure\n- **Description**: GNOME project libxml2 \u003c= 2.9.10 has a global buffer over-read vulnerability in xmlEncodeEntitiesInternal at libxml2/entities.c.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/50f06b3efb638efb0abd95dc62dca05ae67882c2\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri \u003c v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3516](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3516)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Arbitrary code execution (no remote vector)\n- **Description**: A use-after-free security issue was found libxml2 before version 2.9.11 when \"xmllint --html --push\" is used to process crafted files.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/230\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/1358d157d0bd83be1dfe356a69213df9fac0b539\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. This vector does not exist within Nokogiri, which does not ship `xmllint`.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3517](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3517)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Arbitrary code execution\n- **Description**: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in libxml2 before version 2.9.11 when processing truncated UTF-8 input.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/235\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/bf22713507fe1fc3a2c4b525cf0a88c2dc87a3a2\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri \u003c v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3518](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3518)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Arbitrary code execution\n- **Description**: A use-after-free security issue was found in libxml2 before version 2.9.11 in xmlXIncludeDoProcess() in xinclude.c when processing crafted files.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/237\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/1098c30a040e72a4654968547f415be4e4c40fe7\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri \u003c v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3537](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3537)\n\n- **Severity**: Low\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: It was found that libxml2 before version 2.9.11 did not propagate errors while parsing XML mixed content, causing a NULL dereference. If an untrusted XML document was parsed in recovery mode and post-validated, the flaw could be used to crash the application.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/243\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/babe75030c7f64a37826bb3342317134568bef61\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri \u003c v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3541](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3541)\n\n- **Severity**: Low\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: A security issue was found in libxml2 before version 2.9.11. Exponential entity expansion attack its possible bypassing all existing protection mechanisms and leading to denial of service.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/8598060bacada41a0eb09d95c97744ff4e428f8e\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri \u003c v1.11.4, however Nokogiri's default parse options prevent the attack from succeeding (it is necessary to opt into `DTDLOAD` which is off by default).\n\nFor more details supporting this analysis of this CVE, please visit #2233.\n",
