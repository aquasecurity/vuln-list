    "Description": "There is a possible DoS vulnerability in the Token Authentication logic in Action Controller.\n\nVersions Affected:  \u003e= 4.0.0\nNot affected:       \u003c 4.0.0\nFixed Versions:     6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, 5.2.6\n\nImpact\n------\nImpacted code uses `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or `authenticate_with_http_token` for request authentication.  Impacted code will look something like this:\n\n```\nclass PostsController \u003c ApplicationController\n  before_action :authenticate\n\n  private\n\n  def authenticate\n    authenticate_or_request_with_http_token do |token, options|\n      # ...\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nThe following monkey patch placed in an initializer can be used to work around the issue:\n\n```ruby\nmodule ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Token\n  AUTHN_PAIR_DELIMITERS = /(?:,|;|\\t)/\nend\n```\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 5-2-http-authentication-dos.patch - Patch for 5.2 series\n* 6-0-http-authentication-dos.patch - Patch for 6.0 series\n* 6-1-http-authentication-dos.patch - Patch for 6.1 series\n\nPlease note that only the 6.1.Z, 6.0.Z, and 5.2.Z series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.\n\nCredits\n-------\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/wonda_tea_coffee for reporting this issue!",
