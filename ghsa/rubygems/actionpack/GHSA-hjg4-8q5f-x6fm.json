    "Description": "Impact\n------\nThere is a possible information disclosure / unintended method execution vulnerability in Action Pack when using the `redirect_to` or `polymorphic_url` helper with untrusted user input.\n\nVulnerable code will look like this.\n\n```\nredirect_to(params[:some_param])\n```\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nTo work around this problem, it is recommended to use an allow list for valid parameters passed from the user.  For example,\n\n```ruby\nprivate def check(param)\n  case param\n  when \"valid\"\n    param\n  else\n    \"/\"\n  end\nend\n\ndef index\n  redirect_to(check(params[:some_param]))\nend\n```\n\nOr force the user input to be cast to a string like this,\n\n```ruby\ndef index\n  redirect_to(params[:some_param].to_s)\nend\n```\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 5-2-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 5.2 series\n* 6-0-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.0 series\n* 6-1-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.1 series\n\nPlease note that only the 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1 series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to Benoit Côté-Jodoin from Shopify for reporting this.",
