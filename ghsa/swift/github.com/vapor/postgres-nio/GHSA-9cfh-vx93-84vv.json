    "Description": "### Impact\nAny user of PostgresNIO connecting to servers with TLS enabled is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attacker injecting false responses to the client's first few queries, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption.\n\n_The remaining text in this section is quoted verbatim from [PostgreSQL's CVE-2021-23222 advisory](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23222/):_\n\n\u003e If more preconditions hold, the attacker can exfiltrate the client's password or other confidential data that might be transmitted early in a session. The attacker must have a way to trick the client's intended server into making the confidential data accessible to the attacker. A known implementation having that property is a PostgreSQL configuration vulnerable to [CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/). As with any exploitation of [CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/), the server must be using trust authentication with a clientcert requirement or using cert authentication. To disclose a password, the client must be in possession of a password, which is atypical when using an authentication configuration vulnerable to [CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/). The attacker must have some other way to access the server to retrieve the exfiltrated data (a valid, unprivileged login account would be sufficient).\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability is addressed in PostgresNIO versions starting from [1.14.2](https://github.com/vapor/postgres-nio/releases/tag/1.14.2) via [2df54bc94607f44584ae6ffa74e3cd754fffafc7](https://github.com/vapor/postgres-nio/commit/2df54bc94607f44584ae6ffa74e3cd754fffafc7), which required [additional support](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/2419) from SwiftNIO.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds for unpatched users.\n\n### Additional Credits\nSpecial thanks to PostgreSQL's Tom Lane \u003c[tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us](mailto:tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us)\u003e for reporting this issue!\n\n### References\n- [PostgreSQL security advisory for CVE-2021-23222](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23222/)\n- [GitHub security advisory GHSA-735f-7qx4-jqq5 for CVE-2021-23222](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-735f-7qx4-jqq5)\n- [PostgreSQL security advisory for CVE-2021-23214](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2021-23214/)\n- [GitHub security advisory GHSA-467w-rrqc-395f for CVE-2021-23214](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-467w-rrqc-395f)\n- [SwiftNIO PR #2419 Add unprocessedBytes property on NIOSingleStepByteToMessageProcessor](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/2419)\n- [PostgresNIO commit 2df54bc94607f44584ae6ffa74e3cd754fffafc7](https://github.com/vapor/postgres-nio/commit/2df54bc94607f44584ae6ffa74e3cd754fffafc7)\n- [PostgresNIO 1.42.2 release](https://github.com/vapor/postgres-nio/releases/tag/1.14.2)",
