    "Description": "### Summary\nThere is a Path Traversal vulnerability in Attachments that allows attackers with admin rights to upload malicious files to other locations of the web root.\n\n### PoC\n1. In settings, the attachment location is vulnerable to path traversal and can be set to e.g ..\\hacked\n![image](https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/assets/63487456/6167ba74-254c-4aed-9c16-759e5ceafd81)\n\n2. When the above is set, attachments files are now uploaded to e.g C:\\Apps\\XAMPP\\htdocs\\hacked instead of C:\\Apps\\XAMPP\\htdocs\\phpmyfaq\\attachments\n\n3. Verify this by uploading an attachment and see that the \"hacked\" directory is now created in the web root folder with the attachment file inside.\n![image](https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/assets/63487456/325df0cc-e9ee-48bd-a7bb-1295199b4d9e)\n![image](https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/assets/63487456/beb10a6a-9d56-4607-8da6-49581991b1fe)\n\n### Impact\nAttackers can potentially upload malicious files outside the specified directory.\n",
