    "Description": "Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1 (and earlier), 2.4.6-p2 (and earlier), 2.4.5-p4 (and earlier) and 2.4.4-p5 (and earlier) are affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read. A high-privileged authenticated attacker can force the application to make arbitrary requests via injection of arbitrary URLs. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction, scope is changed due to the fact that an attacker can enforce file read outside the application's path boundary.",
