    "Description": "### Summary\n\nUsing the Relay special `node` type you can bypass the configured security on an operation.\n\n### Details\n\nHere is an example of how to apply security configurations for the GraphQL operations:\n\n```php\n#[ApiResource(\n    security: \"is_granted('ROLE_USER')\",\n    operations: [ /* ... */ ],\n    graphQlOperations: [\n        new Query(security: \"is_granted('ROLE_USER')\"),\n        //...\n    ],\n)]\nclass Book { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nThis indeed checks `is_granted('ROLE_USER')` as expected for a GraphQL query like the following:\n\n```php\n‌query {\n    book(id: \"/books/1\") {\n        title\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut the security check can be bypassed by using the `node` field (that is available by default) on the root query type like that:\n\n```php\n‌query {\n    node(id: \"/books/1\") {\n        ... on Book {\n            title\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis does not execute any security checks and can therefore be used to access any entity without restrictions by everyone that has access to the API.\n\n### Impact\n\nEveryone using GraphQl with the `security` attribute. Not sure whereas this works with custom resolvers nor if this also applies on mutation.\n\nPatched at https://github.com/api-platform/core/commit/60747cc8c2fb855798c923b5537888f8d0969568",
