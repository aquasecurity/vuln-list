    "Description": "### Summary\nA security check that gets called after GraphQl resolvers is always replaced by another one as there's no break in this clause: https://github.com/api-platform/core/pull/6444/files#diff-09e3c2cfe12a2ce65bd6c983c7ca6bfcf783f852b8d0554bb938e8ebf5e5fa65R56\n\nhttps://github.com/soyuka/core/blob/7e2e8f9ff322ac5f6eb5f65baf432bffdca0fd51/src/Symfony/Security/State/AccessCheckerProvider.php#L49-L57 \n\n### PoC\n\nCreate a graphql endpoint with a security after resolver.\n\n### Impact\n\nAs this fallsback to `security`, the impact is there only when there's only a security after resolver and none inside security. The test at https://github.com/api-platform/core/pull/6444 is probably broken.",
