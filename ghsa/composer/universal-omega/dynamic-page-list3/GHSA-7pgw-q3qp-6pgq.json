    "Description": "### Summary\nSeveral `#dpl` parameters can leak usernames that have been hidden using revision deletion, suppression, or the `hideuser` block flag.\n\n### Details\nThe parameters `adduser`, `addauthor`, and `addlasteditor` output the page creator or last editor using the `%USER%` placeholder. These display the actual username, even when that name has been hidden using revision deletion, suppression (oversight), or `hideuser`.\n\nThe `%CONTRIBUTOR%` placeholder, used with `addcontribution`, behaves similarly and also reveals hidden usernames.\n\nIn addition, the following parameters can expose suppressed usernames when combined with `%USER%` or similar output placeholders:\n- `lastrevisionbefore`\n- `allrevisionsbefore`\n- `firstrevisionsince`\n- `allrevisionssince`\n\nThese parameters reference specific revisions and allow output of user-related metadata. If a username has been hidden from those revisions, it may still appear in the output.\n\nFurther, the parameters `createdby`, `notcreatedby`, `modifiedby`, `notmodifiedby`, `lastmodifiedby`, and `notlastmodifiedby` accept usernames as input. When the correct (suppressed) username is used, the query may return matching pages or edits. This can reveal the presence and association of a hidden identity, even if not displayed directly. However, this is a more indirect exposure than the output parameters mentioned above.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n1. Create a page while logged in as a user.\n2. Revision delete or suppress the username from the page history.\n3. Use a DPL query with one of the affected parameters.\n4. The output reveals the hidden username.\n\n#### Example\n\nThe following query reveals the suppressed username `Example user`:\n\n```wikitext\n{{#dpl:\n| title = File:Example.png\n| addauthor = true\n| format = ,%USER%,,\n}}\n```\n\nSimilar behavior occurs using parameters like `lastrevisionbefore` with `%USER%` in the `format` string.\n\n### Impact\nThis issue causes the exposure of usernames that were intentionally hidden by administrators. It directly undermines revision deletion, user suppression, and block-related privacy measures. In some cases, usernames can be revealed both directly through output and indirectly through query behavior.",
