    "Description": "Slightly invalid or incomplete SVG markup is not correctly processed and thus not sanitized at all. Albeit the markup is not valid it still is evaluated in browsers and leads to cross-site scripting.\n\nAn updated version 1.0.3 is available from the TYPo3 extension manager and at https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/download/svg_sanitizer/1.0.3/zip/\nUsers of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.",
