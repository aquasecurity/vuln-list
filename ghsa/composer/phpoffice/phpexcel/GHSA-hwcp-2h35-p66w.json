    "Description": "# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability of the hyperlink base in the HTML page header\n\n**Product**: Phpspreadsheet\n**Version**: version 3.6.0\n**CWE-ID**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**CVSS vector v.3.1**: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)\n**CVSS vector v.4.0**: 4.8 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N)\n**Description**: the HTML page is formed without sanitizing the hyperlink base\n**Impact**: executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser\n**Vulnerable component**: class `PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html`, method `generateHTMLHeader`\n**Exploitation conditions**: a user viewing a specially generated Excel file\n**Mitigation**: additional sanitization of special characters in a string\n**Researcher**: Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies)\n\n# Research\n\nThe researcher discovered zero-day vulnerability Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability of the hyperlink base in the HTML page header in Phpspreadsheet.\nThe following code is written on the server, which translates the XLSX file into a HTML representation and displays it in the response.\n\n*Listing 8. Source code on the server*\n\n```\n\u003c?php\n\nrequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n$inputFileName = './doc/Book1.xlsx';\n$spreadsheet = \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\IOFactory::load($inputFileName);\n$writer = new \\PhpOffice\\PhpSpreadsheet\\Writer\\Html($spreadsheet);\nprint($writer-\u003egenerateHTMLAll());\n```\n\nAn attacker can embed a payload in a file property that will result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.\nThe Excel file is unpacked and a HyperlinkBase in the file is inserted into the `docProps/app.xml` file.\n\n![fig14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f68ef7fc-e78e-4424-8753-4318b6ff51c3)\n\n*Figure 14. Embedding the payload* \n\nAfter the changes were made, a new archive with the xlsx extension was created. At the moment of converting the xlsx file into the HTML representation, a property is obtained that participates in the formation of a string without sanitization.\n\n![fig15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa7398c-ddd9-4c5a-ab04-41af0236dcba)\n\n*Figure 15. Generating the HTML page header using the HyperlinkBase property* \n\nAfter generating and displaying the HTML representation of the XLSX file, arbitrary JavaScript code will be executed.\n\u003cimg width=\"356\" alt=\"fig16\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3694661-31e3-4be8-9a86-6eb4dd4647b5\" /\u003e\n\n*Figure 16.
