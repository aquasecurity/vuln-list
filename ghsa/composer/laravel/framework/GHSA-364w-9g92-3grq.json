    "Description": "# Withdrawn\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn after the maintainers of Laravel noted this issue is not a security vulnerability with Laravel itself, but rather a userland issue.\n\n## Original CVE based description\n\nLaravel Framework through 8.70.2 does not sufficiently block the upload of executable PHP content because Illuminate/Validation/Concerns/ValidatesAttributes.php lacks a check for .phar files, which are handled as application/x-httpd-php on systems based on Debian. In some use cases, this may be related to file-type validation for image upload (e.g., differences between getClientOriginalExtension and other approaches).",
