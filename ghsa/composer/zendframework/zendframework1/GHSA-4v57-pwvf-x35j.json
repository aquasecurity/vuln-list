    "Description": "`Zend_Service_ReCaptcha_MailHide` had a potential XSS vulnerability. Due to the fact that the email address was never validated, and because its use of `htmlentities()` did not include the encoding argument, it was potentially possible for a malicious user aware of the issue to inject a specially crafted multibyte string as an attack via the CAPTCHA's email argument",
