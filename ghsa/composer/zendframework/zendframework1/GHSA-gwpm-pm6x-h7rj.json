    "Description": "`Zend_Filter_StripTags` is a filtering class analogous to PHP's `strip_tags()` function. In addition to stripping HTML tags and selectively keeping those provided in a whitelist, it also provides the ability to whitelist specific attributes to retain per whitelisted tag.\n\nThe reporter discovered that attributes that contained whitespace, and in paricular, line breaks, surrounding the attribute assignment operator would not be stripped, regardless of whether or not they were whitelisted. As examples of input affected:\n```\n\u003c!-- newlines before and/or after assignment: --\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://framework.zend.com/issues\" onclick\n=\n\"alert('Broken'); return false;\"\u003eIssues\u003c/a\u003e\n```\nWhen passed to the following code:\n```\n$filter = new Zend_Filter_StripTags(array('a' =\u003e array('href')));\n$value  = $filter-\u003e($html);\n```\nthen the \"onclick\" attribute would remain, even though it was not specified in the tag's whitelist. This could open potential cross-site scripting attack (XSS) vectors.\n\n## Recommendations\nIf you were using `Zend_Filter_StripTags` and utlizing the attribute whitelisting functionality, you should immediately upgrade to Zend Framework 1.7.6 or above; regardless, it is always best to run the most current version of the framework.\n\nAlso, if relying on `Zend_Filter_StripTags` to prevent XSS, the only way to reliably do so is to strip all tags, and never to whitelist. If you are whitelisting, you should consider finding a reliable XSS filter through which to run your output; we recommend HTML Purifier.",
