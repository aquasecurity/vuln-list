    "Description": "Zend_View is a component that utilizes PHP as a templating language. To utilize it, you specify \"script paths\" that contain view scripts, and then `render()` view scripts by specifying subdirectories within those script paths; the output is then returned as a string value which may be cached or directly output.\n\n`Zend_View::setScriptPath()` in versions up to and including 1.7.4 include a potential Local File Inclusion vulnerability. If untrusted input is used to specify the script path and/or view script itself, a malicious attacker could potentially specify a system directory and thus render a system file.\n\nAs an example, if the user-supplied string `/etc/passwd` or a relative path that resolved to that file, was supplied to `Zend_View::render()`, that file would be rendered.",
