    "Description": "### Summary\nThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic related to the segment cloning functionality. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to clone segments without proper authorization checks.\n\nInsecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / Missing Authorization: A missing authorization vulnerability exists in the `cloneAction` of the segment management. This allows an authenticated user to bypass intended permission restrictions and clone segments even if they lack the necessary permissions to create new ones.\n\n### Mitigation\nUpdate Mautic to a version that implements proper authorization checks for the `cloneAction` within the `ListController.php`. Ensure that users attempting to clone segments possess the appropriate creation permissions.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\nEmail us at security@mautic.org",
