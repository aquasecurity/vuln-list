    "Description": "### Impact\n`DyeColorIdMap-\u003efromId()` did not account for the possibility that it might be given invalid input. This means that an undefined offset error would occur whenever this happened.\n\nThis code is indirectly called during [`Banner-\u003edeserializeCompoundTag()`](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/38d6284671e8b657ba557e765a6c29b24a7705f5/src/item/Banner.php#L104), which is invoked when deserializing any item NBT, whether from network or disk.\n\nAn attacker could use this bug to crash a server by providing NBT with invalid values for pattern colours in an inventory transaction, or by using `/give` to obtain an item with NBT like this.\n\n### Patches\n08b9495bce2d65a6d1d3eeb76e484499a00765eb\n\n### Workarounds\nThis is quite difficult to work around via a plugin. Theoretically, it's possible to override the `Banner` item class from a plugin and validate the data before it reaches `deserializeCompoundTag()`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@pmmp.io](mailto:security@pmmp.io)\n",
