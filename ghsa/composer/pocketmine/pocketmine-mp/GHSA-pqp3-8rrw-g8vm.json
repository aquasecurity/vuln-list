    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker could crash the server by sending malformed JWT JSON in `LoginPacket` due to a security vulnerability in [`netresearch/jsonmapper`](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper), due to improper checking for mapping JSON arrays and objects onto scalar model properties such as strings.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem was fixed in a fork of JsonMapper in dktapps/JsonMapper@a31902a31f5b6fdb832f57c0e3a3f16a3b41c012. PocketMine-MP releases 4.20.5 and 4.21.1 have been released with the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Users of PocketMine-MP source installations may manually install the patched version of JsonMapper by backporting commit pmmp/PocketMine-MP@09668a37d66c6023685a948b7550c918620e98f2.\n- A plugin may also be able to workaround this issue by using `DataPacketReceiveEvent` to attempt detection of suspicious payloads. An `ErrorException` will be thrown in the crash case, which can be caught by plugins.\n\n### References\ncweiske/jsonmapper#210\n",
