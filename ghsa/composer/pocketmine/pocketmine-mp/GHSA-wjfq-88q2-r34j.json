    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen handling form responses from the client (`ModalFormResponsePacket`), the Minecraft Windows client may send weird JSON that `json_decode()` can't understand. A workaround for this is implemented in `InGamePacketHandler::stupid_json_decode()`.\n\nAn `InvalidArgumentException` is thrown by this function when it fails to fix an error found in the JSON, which is not caught by the caller. This leads to a server crash.\n\n### Patches\n56fe71d939c38fe14e18a31a673a9331bcc0e4ca\n\n### Workarounds\nA plugin may handle `DataPacketReceiveEvent`, capture `ModalFormResponsePacket` and run the provided JSON through `stupid_json_decode`.\n\nNote that this requires copying the body of the function to a plugin, since the function is currently private.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n",
