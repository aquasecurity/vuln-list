    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker could crash the server by sending malformed JWT JSON in LoginPacket due to a security vulnerability in [netresearch/jsonmapper](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper), due to attempting to construct objects from scalar types by default without any validation, with unexpected results that caused PocketMine-MP to crash.\n\nDue to the relatively high number of security issues arising from this specific dependency, the team is exploring options to replace it.\n\n### Patches\nIn the meantime, the issue was fixed by pmmp/netresearch-jsonmapper@b96a209f9e8b76b899a0d0918493cd87eb3c02a7 and 6872661fd03649cc7a8762c41c16e9ee5a4de1c9.\n\n### Workarounds\nDetecting the malicious data that triggers this issue is of rather high difficulty, so it's not likely that a plugin would be able to easily remediate this.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/cweiske/jsonmapper/issues/226",
