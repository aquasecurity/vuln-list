    "Description": "### Impact\n`LoginPacket` uses `BinaryStream-\u003egetLInt()` to read the lengths of JSON payloads it wants to decode. Unfortunately, `BinaryStream-\u003egetLInt()` returns a signed integer, meaning that a malicious client can craft a packet with a large uint32 value for payload buffer size (which would be interpreted as a negative signed int32), causing `BinaryStream-\u003eget()` to throw an exception.\n\nIn the context of PocketMine-MP, this leads to a server crash when the vulnerability is exploited.\n\n### Patches\ne3fce7632b94e83fd6a518a87dcaf6a11681c4ac\n\n### Workarounds\nThis can be worked around by registering a custom `LoginPacket` implementation into `PacketPool` which overrides [this code](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/blob/47532c95ea37d5f0365b23f734d70d943ff95295/src/LoginPacket.php#L54) to patch it.\n\n### For more information\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)",
