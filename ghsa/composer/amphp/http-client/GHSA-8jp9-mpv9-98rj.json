    "Description": "amphp/http-client has a security weakness that might leak sensitive request headers from the initial request to the redirected host on cross-domain redirects, which were not removed correctly. `Message::setHeaders` does not replace the entire set of headers, but only operates on the headers matching the given array keys.\n\n",
