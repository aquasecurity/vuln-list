    "Description": "### Impact\nA bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could send a specifically crafted encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The payload would be sanitised on the client-side, but server-side sanitisation doesn't catch it.\n\nThe server-side sanitisation logic has been updated to sanitise against this type of attack.\n\n### References\n- https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2024-32981",
