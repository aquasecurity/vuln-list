    "Description": "A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the print view of  GridField.\n\nThis vulnerability can only be exploited if a user with CMS access has posted malicious or unescaped HTML into any field of an object in a GridField, and the print feature is used.\n\nThis has been resolved by ensuring that the print feature safely escapes all fields.",
