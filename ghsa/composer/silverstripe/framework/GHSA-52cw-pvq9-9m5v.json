    "Description": "### Impact\nTinyMCE v6 has a configuration value `convert_unsafe_embeds` set to `false` which allows svg files containing javascript to be used in `\u003cobject\u003e` or `\u003cembed\u003e` tags, which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks.\n\nNote that `\u003cembed\u003e` tags are not allowed by default.\n\nAfter patching the default value of `convert_unsafe_embeds` will be set to `true`. This means that `\u003cobject\u003e` tags will be converted to iframes instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon previously saved `\u003cobject\u003e` tags. Developers can override this configuration if desired to revert to the original behaviour.\n\nWe reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.\n\n### References:\n- https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2024-001\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5359-pvf2-pw78\n\n",
