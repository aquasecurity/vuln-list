    "Description": "An attacker could use a specially crafted graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed and particularly large/complex graphql schemas.\n\nIf your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this will likely further mitigate the risk.\n\nUpgrade to `silverstripe/graphql` 4.2.3 or 4.1.2 or above to remedy the vulnerability.",
