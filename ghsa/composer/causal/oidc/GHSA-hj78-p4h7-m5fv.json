    "Description": "## Problem Description\nA vulnerability in the account linking logic of the extension allows a pre-hijacking attack leading to Account Takeover. The attack can only be exploited if the following requirements are met:\n\n- An attacker can anticipate the email address of the user.\n- An attacker can register a public frontend user account using that email address before the user's first OIDC login.\n- The IDP returns the field email containing the email address of the user\n\n## Solution\nAn updated versions 4.0.0 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager, packagist and at \nhttps://extensions.typo3.org/extension/download/oidc/4.0.0/zip\n\nUsers of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.",
