    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThis advisory affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host.\n\nThis vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v3.5.15.\n\n### References\n\nCredits to:\n- [Benzetaa](https://github.com/benzetaa/)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)",
