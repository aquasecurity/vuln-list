    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA user with access to the media manager that stores SVG files could create a stored XSS attack against themselves and any other user with access to the media manager when SVG files are supported.\n\nSVG files are supported by default in v3 for convenience; however, this has resulted in multiple mistaken vulnerability reports from security researchers. As per the documentation, if a backend user is not trusted, the advice is to remove the `svg` extension from the list of supported file types.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in v3.5.2 by including an SVG sanister. It is enabled by default for new installations but must be enabled for existing sites in the **config/media.php** file.\n\n```\n'clean_vectors' =\u003e true,\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade for this patch, follow the pervious advice and remove `svg` from the supported file types.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/octobercms/october/blob/3.x/config/media.php\n\nCredits to:\n- Faris Krivic\n- Okan Kurtulus\n- Aldin Visnjic\n- Bug Shankar\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n",
