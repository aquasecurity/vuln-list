    "Description": "### Impact\nApplication passing unsanitized user input to `Carbon::setLocale` are at risk of arbitrary file include, if the application allows users to upload files with `.php` extension in an folder that allows `include` or `require` to read it, then they are at risk of arbitrary code ran on their servers.\n\n### Patches\n- [3.8.4](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/releases/tag/3.8.4)\n- [2.72.6](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/releases/tag/2.72.6)\n\n### Workarounds\nAny of the below actions can be taken to prevent the issue:\n- Validate input before calling `setLocale()`, for instance by forbidding or removing `/` and `\\`\n- Call `setLocale()` only with a locale from a whitelist of supported locales\n- When uploading files, rename them so they cannot have a `.php` extension (this is recommended even if you're not affected by this issue)\n- Prefer storage system that are not local to the application (remote service, or local service ran by another user so the uploaded files actually live outside of the application basedir)\n\n### References\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_inclusion_vulnerability\n\n### Credits\nThanks to **Szczepan Ho≈Çyszewski** who reported the issue and to Tidelift to coordinate the resolution",
