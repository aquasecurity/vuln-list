    "Description": "### Summary\nBagisto v2.3.7 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) due to unsanitized user input being processed by the server-side templating engine when rendering product descriptions. This allows an attacker with product creation privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated by the backend — potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.\n\n### Details\nIn Bagisto, product descriptions are rendered through Laravel’s Blade templating engine in various front-end and admin views. The product description field is not sanitized or escaped before being passed to the view, which means user-supplied data can break out of the expected string context and execute arbitrary template code.\n\n### PoC\nCreate a product and enter the payload to the description.\n\u003cimg width=\"679\" height=\"669\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e5dac3f-4043-4b31-98ed-f4346feb5477\" /\u003e\nPreview the page, observed that the template expressions were evaluated by the backend and displayed on the screen.\n\u003cimg width=\"1431\" height=\"922\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f29c6e-05f4-40c4-9926-0c59e0a979c2\" /\u003e\n\n\n### Impact\nRCE potential: Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code or system commands.\nData breach: Read sensitive environment variables (.env), API keys, or database credentials.\nDefacement / persistence: Inject malicious scripts or backdoors in dynamic templates.\nPrivilege escalation: If attackers have limited roles (e.g., product manager), they can compromise the entire application or host.",
