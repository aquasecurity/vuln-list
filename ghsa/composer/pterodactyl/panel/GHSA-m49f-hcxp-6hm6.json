    "Description": "### Impact\nA malicious user can trigger a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious website that makes a request to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This requires a targeted attack against a specific Panel instance, and serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked, nor is any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.**\n\n### Patches\nNone.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please contact `Tactical Fish#8008` on Discord, or email `dane@pterodactyl.io`.\n",
