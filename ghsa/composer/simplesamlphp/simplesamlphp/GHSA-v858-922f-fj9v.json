    "Description": "### Background\nSeveral scripts part of SimpleSAMLphp display a web page with links obtained from the request parameters. This allows us to enhance usability, as the users are presented with links they can follow after completing a certain action, like logging out.\n\n### Description\nThe following scripts were not checking the URLs obtained via the HTTP request before displaying them as the target of links that the user may click on:\n\n- www/logout.php\n- modules/core/www/no_cookie.php\nThe issue allowed attackers to display links targeting a malicious website inside a trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp, due to the lack of security checks involving the link_href and retryURL HTTP parameters, respectively. The issue was resolved by including a verification of the URLs received in the request against a white list of websites specified in the trusted.url.domains configuration option.\n\n### Affected versions\nAll SimpleSAMLphp versions prior to 1.14.4.\n\n### Impact\nA remote attacker could craft a link pointing to a trusted website running SimpleSAMLphp, including a parameter pointing to a malicious website, and try to fool the victim into visiting that website by clicking on a link in the page presented by SimpleSAMLphp.\n",
