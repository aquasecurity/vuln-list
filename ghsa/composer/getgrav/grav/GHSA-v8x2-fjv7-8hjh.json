    "Description": "### Summary\nDue to a broken access control vulnerability in the `/admin/pages/{page_name}` endpoint, an editor ( user with full permissions to pages ) can change the functionality of a form after submission.\n\n### Details\nDue to improper authorization checks when modifying critical fields on a POST request to `/admin/pages/{page_name}`, an editor with only permissions to change basic content on the form is now able to change the functioning of the form through modifying the content of the `data[_json][header][form]` which is the YAML frontmatter which includes the `process` section which dictates what happens after a user submits the form which include some important actions that could lead to further vulnerabilities.\n\n### PoC\n\n- Have Admin and Form plugins installed\n- Connect to panel as admin, create user and give him permission for pages all\n- Now connect as that user and notice you cant edit any process field in the panel\n- Change anything in the content of the form and save\n- Intercept the request:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a66767d9-648e-45b5-9031-4a15bee3072a)\n\n- Now modify the field `data[_json][header][form] with the following payload URL-encoded not like this:\n```\n{\"name\":\"ssti-test 2\",\"fields\":{\"name\":{\"type\":\"text\",\"label\":\"Name\",\"required\":true}},\"buttons\":{\"submit\":{\"type\":\"submit\",\"value\":\"Submit\"}},\"process\":[{\"message\":\"{{ evaluate_twig(form.value('name')) }}\"}]}\n```\n\n- Change the field and forward it:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd5f95d7-c61f-4fc0-9e9a-e67825f20aea)\n\nRequest goes through and changes have been made to the form.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42a77e10-571b-43a2-8410-14d82dba28e5)\n\n### Impact\n\n- Attacker can modify submission logic of the form which leads to changing redirect value, email sending, changing template, breaking out of the Twig sandbox potentially executing code...\n\n### Fix recommendation\n\n- Implement proper authorization checks to such requests especially when it contains fields user shouldn't be able to modify based on his role.",
