    "Description": "## Summary\n\nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `/admin/accounts/groups/Grupo` endpoint of the _Grav_ application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `data[readableName]` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `POST /admin/accounts/groups/Grupo`  \n**Parameter:** `data[readableName]`\n\nThe application fails to properly validate and sanitize user input in the `data[readableName]` parameter. This lack of input handling allows attackers to inject arbitrary script content that is stored in the application and executed in the browser of any user who views the affected group configuration.\n\n---\n\n## PoC\n\n**Payload:**\n\n`\u003cScRipT\u003ealert('PoC-XSS')\u003c/ScRipT\u003e`\n\n1. Navigate to **Accounts \u003e Groups** in the administrative panel.\n    \n2. Create a new group or edit an existing one.\n    \n3. In the **Display Name** field (`data[readableName]`), insert the payload above and save the changes.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6db531e-9968-4fc5-8329-12183975096c)\n\n\nThe following HTTP request was generated during this action:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e9a2c6-f7be-45b4-8aaf-13e64940561f)\n\n\n4. Next, go to **Accounts \u003e Users** and open any user profile.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a09215ab-17a2-4b17-9b58-cf3737d95ba2)\n\n\n5. The malicious script is executed immediately in the browser when the page loads, confirming the existence of a **Stored XSS** vulnerability.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8411ca04-4d84-4f88-9c6a-7dd88e65a6e0)\n\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nStored XSS vulnerabilities can result in serious consequences, including:\n\n- **Session hijacking:** Attackers can steal authentication cookies or tokens\n    \n- **Malware delivery:** Inserting scripts that download malicious content\n    \n- **Credential theft:** Capturing usernames and passwords through injected forms\n    \n- **Sensitive data exposure:** Accessing data stored in the browser or the application\n    \n- **Browser takeover:** Executing arbitrary commands in the user’s session\n    \n- **Phishing attacks:** Redirecting users to fake login or malicious sites\n    \n- **Website defacement:** Altering page content shown to users\n    \n- **Reputational damage:** Undermining trust in the platform or organization\n\nby [CVE-Hunters](https://github.com/Sec-Dojo-Cyber-House/cve-hunters)",
