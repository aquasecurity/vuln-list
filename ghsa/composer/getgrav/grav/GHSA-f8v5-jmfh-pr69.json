    "Description": "### Summary\nA low privilege user account with page edit privilege can read any server files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - /grav/user/accounts/*.yaml. This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password.\n\n### Proof Of Concept\n`{{ read_file('/var/www/html/grav/user/accounts/riri.yaml') }}`\n\nUse the above Twig template syntax in a page and observe that the administrator riri's authentication details are exposed accessible by any unauthenticated user. \n\n![file-read-2-ATO](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/assets/48800246/9dee4daa-f029-40dd-9646-94c794d3f254)\n\nAs an additional proof of concept for reading system files, observe the `/etc/passwd` file read using the following Twig syntax:\n`{{ read_file('/etc/passwd') }}`\n\n![file-read-etc-passwd](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/assets/48800246/e45de4d4-f81f-42cf-8466-aa36b225ca94)\n\n### Impact\nThis can allow a low privileged user to perform a full account takeover of other registered users including Adminsitrators. This can also allow an adversary to read any file in the web server.",
