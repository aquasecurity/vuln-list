    "Description": "### Impact\nThis is a significant Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any application that uses FPDI to process\nuser-supplied PDF files is at risk. An attacker can upload a small, malicious PDF file that will cause\nthe server-side script to crash due to memory exhaustion. Repeated attacks can lead to sustained\nservice unavailability.\n\n### Patches\nFixed as of version 2.6.4\n\n### Workarounds\nNo.",
