    "Description": "Flarum's page title system allowed for page titles to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when pages were rendered. The change was made after `v1.5` and was not noticed.\n\nThis allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML markup using a discussion title input, either by creating a new discussion or renaming one. The XSS attack occurs after a visitor opens the relevant discussion page.\n\n### Impact\nAll communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` are impacted.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core `v1.6.2`. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` have to upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.2 using:\n\n```\ncomposer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -a -W\n```\n\nYou can then confirm you run the latest version using:\n\n```\ncomposer show flarum/core\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n**None**\n\n### For more information\nFor any questions or comments on this vulnerability please visit https://discuss.flarum.org/d/27558.\n\nFor support questions create a discussion at https://discuss.flarum.org/t/support.\n\nA reminder that if you ever become aware of a security issue in Flarum, please report it to us privately by emailing [security@flarum.org](mailto:security@flarum.org), and we will address it promptly.\n",
