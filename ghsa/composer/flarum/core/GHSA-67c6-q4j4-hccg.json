    "Description": "## Impact\nThe Flarum forum software is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind SSRF attack or disclose any file on the server, even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image` package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL, which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, disclose local file contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in Flarum **v1.8**.\n\n## Workarounds\nAs a temporary workaround for the SSRF aspect of the vulnerability, one can disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs.\n\n### Credits\nAdam Kues - [Assetnote](https://assetnote.io/)\n",
