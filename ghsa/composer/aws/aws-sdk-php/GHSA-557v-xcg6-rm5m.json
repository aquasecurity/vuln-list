    "Description": "### Impact\nWithin the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is possible. The issue exists in the`buildEndpoint` method in the `RestSerializer` component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 `UriResolver` utility, which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed.\n\nVersions of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 before 3.288.1 are affected by this issue.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to the AWS SDK for PHP \u003e= 3.288.1, if you are on version \u003c 3.288.1.\n\n### References\nRFC 3986 - [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.4)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact [AWS's Security team](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).",
