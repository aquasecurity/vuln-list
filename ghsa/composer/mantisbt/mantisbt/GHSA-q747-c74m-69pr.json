    "Description": "When a user edits their profile to change their e-mail address, the system saves it without validating that it actually belongs to the user.\n\n### Impact\nThis could result in storing an invalid email address, preventing the user from receiving system notifications.\n\nNotifications sent to another person's email address could lead to information disclosure.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 2.27.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to @ncrcs for discovering and reporting the issue.",
