    "Description": "### Impact\nBy crafting a special `GET` request containing a valid form state, a form can be submitted without invoking any validators.\nWe consider the severity _low_ because it is not possible to _change_ any form values since the form state is secured with an HMAC that is still verified.\nThat means that this issue can only be exploited if Form Finishers cause side effects even if no form values have been sent.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/neos/form/commit/69de4219b1f58157e2be6b05811463875d75c246\n\n### Workarounds\nForm Finishers can be adjusted in a way that they only execute an action if the submitted form contains some expected data.\nAlternatively a custom Finisher can be added as first finisher.\n\n### References\nThis regression was introduced with https://github.com/neos/form/commit/049d415295be8d4a0478ccba97dba1bb81649567\nOriginal report: https://tickets.neos.io/#ticket/zoom/411 (internal)",
