    "Description": "# Reflected XSS at /lgsl_files/lgsl_list.php\n\n\n**Description:**\n\nVulnerability: A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the `Referer` HTTP header of [LGSL v6.2.1](https://github.com/tltneon/lgsl/releases/tag/v6.2.1). The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization.\nWhen crafted malicious input is provided in the `Referer` header, it is echoed back into an HTML attribute in the applicationâ€™s response.\n\n\nThe vulnerability is present at [Line 20-24](https://github.com/tltneon/lgsl/blob/master/lgsl_files/lgsl_list.php#L20-L24)\n```php\n  $uri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];\n\n  if ($lgsl_config['preloader']) {\n    $uri = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];\n  }\n```\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\n1. Capture a request to the path `/lgsl_files/lgsl_list.php`.\n2. Inject the following payload into the Referer header: `test'\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert(1)\u003c/script\u003e\u003c`.\n3. Send the request.\n4. The XSS payload is triggered when reloading.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/467a6c60-db45-4520-9918-59dff819b384)\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c537c59e-38c2-47f0-97d8-54ee1b2018b8)\n\n\n\n**Impact:**\n\nExecution of Malicious Code\n\n",
