    "Description": "### Update\nIn [#88](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues/88) we have determined that the bypass this security advisory was created for, was a false positive and as such we have requested that the CVE be rejected.\n\n___\n\nA bypass has been found that allows an attacker to upload an SVG with persistent XSS.\n\nHTML elements within CDATA needed to be sanitized correctly, as we were converting them to a textnode and therefore, the library wasn't seeing them as DOM elements.\n\nAny data within a CDATA node will now be sanitised using [HTMLPurifier](https://github.com/ezyang/htmlpurifier). We've also removed many of the HTML and MathML elements from the allowed element list, as without `ForiegnObject`, they're not legal within the SVG context. \n\nAdditional tests have been added to the test suite to account for these new bypasses.\n\n### Impact\nThis impacts all users of the `svg-sanitizer` library.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed in 0.16.0 and higher.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is currently no workaround available without upgrading.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in [Github](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues)\nEmail us at [daryll@enshrined.co.uk](mailto:daryll@enshrined.co.uk)",
