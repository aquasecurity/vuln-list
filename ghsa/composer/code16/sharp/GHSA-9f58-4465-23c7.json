    "Description": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp when rendering content using the SharpShowTextField component.\n\nIn affected versions, expressions wrapped in `{{` \u0026 `}}` were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that executes in the browser when the field is displayed.\n\nFor example, if a field’s value contains `{{ Math.random() }}`, it will be executed instead of being displayed as text.\n\n### Impact\n\nAttackers who can control content rendered through SharpShowTextField could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an authenticated user’s browser.\n\nThis could lead to:\n\n- Theft of user session tokens.\n- Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users.\n- Injection of malicious content into the admin panel.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in v9.11.1 of code16/sharp package.\n\n### Mitigation / Workarounds\n\nSanitize or encode any user-provided data that may include (`{{` \u0026 `}}`) before displaying it in a SharpShowTextField.",
