    "Description": "Description\n-----------\n\nThe `CachingHttpClient` class from the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the `HttpCache` class to handle requests. `HttpCache` uses internal headers like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File` to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by `CachingHttpClient` and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the `CachingHttpClient`, remote code execution is possible.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nHTTP headers designed for internal use in `HttpCache` are now stripped from remote responses before being passed to `HttpCache`.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d9910e0b33a2e0f993abff41c6fbc86951b66d78) for the 4.4 branch.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nI would like to thank Matthias Pigulla (webfactory GmbH) for reporting and fixing the issue.",
