This includes the possibility to fetch _typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php_ which again contains the _encryptionKey_ as well as credentials of the database management system being used.\n\nIn case a database server is directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom extensions.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.20 or 10.4.6 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007)",
