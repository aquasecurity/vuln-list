However, it is not limited to the same site context and does not require the attacker to be authenticated. In a worst case scenario, the attacker could create a new admin user account to compromise the system.\n\nTo successfully carry out an attack, an attacker must trick his victim to access a compromised system. The victim must have an active session in the TYPO3 backend at that time.\n\nThe following [Same-Site cookie settings](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/8.7.x/Feature-90351-ConfigureTYPO3-shippedCookiesWithSameSiteFlag.html) in _$GLOBALS[TYPO3_CONF_VARS][BE][cookieSameSite]_ are required for an attack to be successful:\n\n* _SameSite=_***strict***: malicious evil.**example.org** invoking TYPO3 application at good.**example.org**\n* _SameSite=_***lax*** or ***none***: malicious **evil.com** invoking TYPO3 application at **example.org**\n\n### Solution\nUpdate your instance to TYPO3 version 11.5.0 which addresses the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Richie Lee who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core \u0026 security team members Benni Mack and Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-014](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-014)\n* [CVE-2020-11069](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11069) reintroduced in TYPO3 v11.2.0",
