    "Description": "\n### Problem\nDue to the lack of ensuring file extensions belong to configured allowed mime-types, attackers can upload arbitrary data with arbitrary file extensions - however, default _fileDenyPattern_ successfully blocked files like _.htaccess_ or _malicious.php_.\n\nTYPO3 Extbase extensions, which implement a file upload and do not implement a custom _TypeConverter_ to transform uploaded files into _FileReference_ domain model objects are affected by the vulnerability as well, since the _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ of _ext:form_ handles the file upload and will accept files of any mime-type which are persisted to the default location.\n\nIn any way, uploaded files are placed in the default location _/fileadmin/user_upload/_, in most scenarios keeping the submitted filename - which allows attackers to directly reference files, or even correctly guess filenames used by other individuals, disclosing this information.\n\nNo authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 that fix the problem described.\n\nType converter _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ is not registered globally anymore and just handles uploaded files within the scope of the Form Framework. Guessable storage location has changed from _/fileadmin/user_upload/form\\_\\\u003crandom-hash\\\u003e/_ to _/fileadmin/form_uploads/\u003crandom-40-bit\u003e_. Allowed mime-types must match expected file extensions (e.g. _application/pdf_ must be _.pdf_, and cannot be _.html_).\n\nExtbase extensions, who rely on the global availability of the _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ must now implement a custom _TypeConverter_ to handle file uploads or explicitly implement the ext:form _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ with appropriate setting for accepted mime-types.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Sebastian Michaelsen, Marc Lindemann, Oliver Eglseder, Markus Volkmer, Jakob Kunzmann, Johannes Regner, Richie Lee who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core \u0026 security team members Oliver Hader \u0026 Benni Mack, as well as TYPO3 contributor Ralf Zimmermann who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-002](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-002)",
