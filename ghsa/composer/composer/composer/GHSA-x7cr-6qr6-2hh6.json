    "Description": "The Composer method `VcsDriver::getFileContent()` with user-controlled `$file` or `$identifier` arguments is susceptible to an argument injection vulnerability. It can be leveraged to gain arbitrary command execution if the Mercurial or the Git driver are used.\n\nThis led to a vulnerability on Packagist.org and Private Packagist, i.e., using the composer.json `readme` field as a vector for injecting parameters into the `$file` argument for the Mercurial driver or via the `$identifier` argument for the Git and Mercurial drivers.\n\nComposer itself can be attacked through branch names by anyone controlling a Git or Mercurial repository, which is explicitly listed by URL in a project's composer.json.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this was not actively exploited. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.",
