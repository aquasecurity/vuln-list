    "Description": "### Impact\nDue to a wrong configuration in the `.htaccess` file, the configuration file of Javascript dependencies could be read in production environments (`themes/package-lock.json`). With this information, the used Shopware version might be determined by an attacker, which could be used for further attacks. \n\n### Patches\nWe recommend updating to the current version 5.7.18. You can get the update to 5.7.18 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the release page.\nhttps://github.com/shopware5/shopware/releases/tag/v5.7.18\n\nFor older versions you can use the Security Plugin:\nhttps://store.shopware.com/en/swag575294366635f/shopware-security-plugin.html\n\n\n### References\nhttps://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/security-updates/security-update-06-2023\n",
