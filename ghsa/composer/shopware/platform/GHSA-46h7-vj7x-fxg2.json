    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe newsletter double opt-in validation was not checked properly, and it was possible to skip the complete double opt in process.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed with 6.4.18.1\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version. Or disable the newsletter registration completely.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-01-2023?category=security-updates\n\n",
