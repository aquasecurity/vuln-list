    "Description": "### Impact\n\nPrivate files publicly accessible with Cloud Storage providers when the hashed URL is known\n\n### Patches\n\nWe recommend first changing your configuration to set the correct visibility according to the documentation. The visibility must be at the same level as `type`.\n\nWhen the Storage is saved on Amazon AWS we recommending disabling public access to the bucket containing the private files: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html\n\nOtherwise, update to Shopware 6.4.1.1 or install or update the Security plugin (https://store.shopware.com/en/detail/index/sArticle/518463/number/Swag136939272659) and run the command `./bin/console s3:set-visibility` to correct your cloud file visibilities \n",
