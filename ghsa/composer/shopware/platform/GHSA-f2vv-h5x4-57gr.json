    "Description": "### Impact\nLeak of information via Store-API\n\n### Patches\nWe recommend to update to the current version 6.3.5.1. You can get the update to 6.3.5.1 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview.\n\nhttps://www.shopware.com/en/download/#shopware-6\n\nThe vulnerability could only be fixed by changing the API system, which involves a non-backward-compatible change. Only consumers of the Store-API should be affected by this change. Please check your plugins if you have it in use. Detailed technical information can be found in the upgrade information.\n\nhttps://github.com/shopware/platform/blob/v6.3.5.1/UPGRADE-6.3.md#6351\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1 and 6.2, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.\n\nhttps://store.shopware.com/en/detail/index/sArticle/518463/number/Swag136939272659\n\n### For more information\nhttps://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-02-2021",
