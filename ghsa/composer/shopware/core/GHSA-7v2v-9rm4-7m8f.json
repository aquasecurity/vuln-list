    "Description": "### Impact\nWe fixed with [CVE-2023-22731](https://github.com/shopware/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-93cw-f5jj-x85w) Twig filters to only be executed with allowed functions. It is possible to pass PHP Closures as string or an array and array crafted PHP Closures was not checked against allow list\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed with 6.4.20.1 with an improved override.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-04-2023?category=security-updates\n\n",
