    "Description": "### Impact\nIn Twig environment **without the Sandbox extension**, it is possible to refer to PHP functions in twig filters like `map`, `filter`, `sort`. This allows in the template to call any global PHP function. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed with 6.4.18.1 with an override of the specified filters until the integration of the Sandbox extension has been finished.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-01-2023?category=security-updates\n\n",
