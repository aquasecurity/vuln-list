    "Description": "## Withdrawn\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the CVE has been disputed and the underlying vulnerability is likely invalid. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n[According to maintainers of Craft CMS](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2443#issuecomment-1610634200), only administrators can access Settings, and those administrators may have business needs for their permissions. Additionally, the underlying issue likely has little to no real-world security impact.\n\n## Original Description\nCraftCMS is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). An authenticated attacker can inject Twig Template to User Photo Location field when setting User Photo Location in User Settings, lead to Remote Code Execution.",
