    "Description": "### Impact\nIt is possible to inject malicious code into the HTML content of an email notification, which is then rendered on the preview. There is no issue when rendering the email via normal means (a delivered email).\n\nThis would require access to the form's email notification settings.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in Formie 2.1.44. Users should ensure they are running at least this version.",
