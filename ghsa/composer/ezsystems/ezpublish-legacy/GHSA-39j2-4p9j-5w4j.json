    "Description": "This Security Advisory is about a vulnerability in the Legacy shop module. A backend editor could perform object injection in discount rules. This would require backend access and permission to edit discount rules. While object injection in itself is a serious vulnerability, the permission requirement means that normally only administrators would be able to exploit it, that's why it was classified as Medium severity.",
