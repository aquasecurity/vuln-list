    "Description": "If a function is defined that has the same name as the default built-in email address validation scheme (`php`), it will be called in default configuration as when no validation scheme is provided, the default scheme's callable `php` was being called. If an attacker is able to inject such a function into the application (a much bigger issue), it will be called whenever an email address is validated, such as when calling `validateAddress()`.\n\n### Impact\nLow impact â€“ exploitation requires that an attacker can already inject code into an application, but it provides a trigger pathway.\n\n### Patches\nThis is patched in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names, which is a very minor BC break.\n\n### Workarounds\nInject your own email validator function.\n\n### References\nReported by [Vikrant Singh Chauhan](mailto:vi@hackberry.xyz) via [huntr.dev](https://www.huntr.dev/).\n[CVE-2021-3603](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-3603)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the PHPMailer project](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)\n* [Email us](mailto:phpmailer@synchromedia.co.uk).\n",
