    "Description": "Assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured.\n\n### Impact\n\n- Affects front-end forms with `assets` fields.\n- Affects other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway.\n- Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files.\n- Traversal _outside_ an asset container was not possible.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in 5.17.0.",
