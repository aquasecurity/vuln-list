    "Description": "### Impact\nThe application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other malicious activities.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager/pull/475 which is released in version 0.6.8\n\n### Workarounds\nOnly authenticated users with access to the translation manager are impacted.\n\n### References\n[[PT-2025-04] laravel translation manager.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20639250/PT-2025-04.laravel.translation.manager.pdf)\n\n### Reported by\nPositive Technologies (Artem Deikov, Ilya Tsaturov, Daniil Satyaev, Roman Cheremnykh, Artem Danilov, Stanislav Gleym)",
