    "Description": "### Impact\nThe pimcore application is vulnerable to Formula Injection/CSV Injection via the Firstname, Lastname, Street, Zip \u0026 City input fields. These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted excel file.\n\nSuccessful exploitation can lead to impacts such as client-sided command injection, code execution, or remote ex-filtration of contained confidential data.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to version 3.3.9 or apply this patch manually https://github.com/pimcore/customer-data-framework/commit/4e0105c3a78d20686a0c010faef27d2297b98803.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nApply patch https://github.com/pimcore/customer-data-framework/commit/4e0105c3a78d20686a0c010faef27d2297b98803.patch manually.\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.dev/bounties/821ff465-4754-42d1-9376-813c17f16a01/\n",
