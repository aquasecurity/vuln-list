    "Description": "### Summary\n \nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in PIMCORE allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the PDF upload functionality. This can result in the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser when the PDF is viewed, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement of web pages, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n \n### Details\n \nThe vulnerability is present in the PDF upload functionality of the PIM Core Upload module. When a user uploads a PDF file, the application fails to properly sanitize the content, allowing embedded scripts to be executed when the PDF is viewed. The affected code is located in the file handling and rendering logic of the PDF upload feature.\n \n### PoC\n \n\n \n1. Log in as Administrator\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7945bbd7-5277-4a0e-8365-56e5df319bae)\n\n2.
