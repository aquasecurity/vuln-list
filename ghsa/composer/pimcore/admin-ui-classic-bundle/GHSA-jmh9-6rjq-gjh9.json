This version is vulnerable to cross-site-scripting (XSS).\n\n### Details\nIn jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML containing elements from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code. This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.\n\nPublish Date: 2020-04-29\n\nURL:= https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/jquery/3.4.1\n",
