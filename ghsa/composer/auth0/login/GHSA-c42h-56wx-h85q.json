    "Description": "**Overview**\nThe laravel-auth0 SDK contains a critical vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of cookie data. If exploited, since SDKs process cookie content without prior authentication, a threat actor could send a specially crafted cookie containing malicious serialized data.\n\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following preconditions:\n\n1. Applications using laravel-auth0 SDK, versions between 7.0.0-BETA1 to 7.2.1.\n2. Laravel-auth0 SDK uses the Auth0-PHP SDK with version 8.0.0-BETA3 to 8.3.0.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade Auth0/laravel-auth0 to the latest version (v7.17.0).\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta would like to thank Andreas Forsblom for discovering this vulnerability.",
