    "Description": "**Overview**\nThe Auth0 PHP SDK contains a vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of cookie data. If exploited, since SDKs process cookie content without prior authentication, a threat actor could send a specially crafted cookie containing malicious serialized data.\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following preconditions:\n\n1. Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, versions between 8.0.0-BETA3 to 8.3.0. \n2. Applications using the following SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK versions between 8.0.0-BETA3 to 8.3.0:\n    a. Auth0/symfony,\n    b. Auth0/laravel-auth0,\n    c. Auth0/wordpress.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to 8.3.1.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta would like to thank Andreas Forsblom for discovering this vulnerability.",
