    "Description": "**Overview**\nThe Auth0 Symfony SDK contains a critical vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of cookie data. If exploited, since SDKs process cookie content without prior authentication, a threat actor could send a specially crafted cookie containing malicious serialized data.\n\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following preconditions:\n\n1. Applications using the Auth0 Symfony SDK, versions between 5.0.0 BETA-0 to 5.0.0. \n2. Auth0 Symfony SDK uses the Auth0-PHP SDK with version 8.0.0-BETA3 to 8.3.0.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade Auth0/symfony to the latest version (v5.4.0).\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta would like to thank Andreas Forsblom for discovering this vulnerability.",
