    "Description": "**Overview**\nSession cookies of applications using the Auth0 symfony SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access.\n\n**Am I Affected?**\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following pre-conditions:\n1. Applications using the Auth0 symfony SDK with version \u003c=5.3.1\n2. Auth0/Symfony SDK uses the Auth0-PHP SDK with version 8.0.0-BETA1 or higher and below 8.14.0. \n3. Session storage configured with CookieStore.\n\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade Auth0/symfony to v5.4.0. As an additional precautionary measure, we recommend rotating your cookie encryption keys. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\nOkta would like to thank FÃ©lix Charette for discovering this vulnerability.",
