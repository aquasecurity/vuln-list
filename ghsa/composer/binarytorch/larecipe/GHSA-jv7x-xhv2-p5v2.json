    "Description": "### Impact\nAttackers could:\n1. Execute arbitrary commands on the server\n2. Access sensitive environment variables\n3. Escalate access depending on server configuration\n\nA critical vulnerability was discovered in LaRecipe that allows an attacker to perform Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in vulnerable configurations.\n\n### Patches\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to version v2.8.1 or later.\n\n### Credit\nWe would like to thank **Roman Ananev** for responsibly identifying and reporting this vulnerability.",
