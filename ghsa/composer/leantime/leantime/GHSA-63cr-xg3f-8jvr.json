    "Description": "### Summary\nStored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, is the more damaging of the two. It occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application. \n\n### Details\nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found that could potentially compromise user data and pose a significant security risk to the platform.\n\n### PoC\n\n- Create a project\n- Navigate to project\n- Visit to the integration\n- Add malicious payload inside the webhook and save it.\n- Notice the alert dialogue indicating successful execution of the XSS payload.\n```\n'';!--\" onfocus=alert(0) autofocus=\"\"  onload=alert(3);=\"\u0026amp;{(alert(1))}\" |=\"\" mufazmi\"=\"\n```\n```\n'';!--\" onfocus=alert(0) autofocus=\"\"  onload=alert(3);=\u003e\u003e\"\u0026amp;{(alert(1))}\" |=\"\"\u003e\u003e mufazmi\"=\"\u003e\u003e\n```\n### POC\nhttps://youtu.be/kqKFgsOqstg\n\n\n### Impact\nThis XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser when they click on a specially crafted link. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive information such as cookies or login credentials, and potentially compromising the entire platform's security.",
