    "Description": "## Description\n\nWhen linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if -\u003estateless() is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks.\n\n## Resolution\nSocialstream v6.2 introduces a new custom route that requires a user to \"Confirm\" or \"Deny\" a request to link a social account.",
