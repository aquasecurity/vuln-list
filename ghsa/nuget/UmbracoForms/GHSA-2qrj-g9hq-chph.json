    "Description": "### Impact\nThe 'Send email' workflow does not HTML encode the user-provided field values in the sent email message, making any form with this workflow configured vulnerable, as it allows sending the message from a trusted system and address (potentially bypassing spam and email client security systems).\n\n### Patches\nThis issue affects all (supported) versions Umbraco Forms and is patched in 13.4.2 and 15.1.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nUnpatched or unsupported versions can workaround this issue by using the 'Send email with template (Razor)' workflow instead or [writing a custom workflow type](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-forms/developer/extending/adding-a-workflowtype).\n\nTo avoid accidentally using the vulnerable workflow again, the `SendEmail` workflow type can be removed using the following composer (tested on Umbraco 10, 13, 14 and 15):\n```c#\nusing Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;\nusing Umbraco.Forms.Core.Providers.Extensions;\nusing Umbraco.Forms.Core.Providers.WorkflowTypes;\n\ninternal sealed class RemoveFormsSendEmailWorkflowTypeComposer : IComposer\n{\n    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)\n        =\u003e builder.FormsWorkflows().Exclude\u003cSendEmail\u003e();\n}\n```",
