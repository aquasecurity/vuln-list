    "Description": "### Impact\nOn Unix-like operating systems (not Windows or macos), MPXJ's use of `File.createTempFile(..)` results in temporary files being created with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file. When MPXJ is reading a type of schedule file which requires the creation of a temporary file or directory, a knowledgeable local user could locate these transient files while they are in use and would then be able to read the schedule being processed by MPXJ.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched, MPXJ version 10.14.1 and later includes the necessary changes.\n\n### Workarounds\nSetting `java.io.tmpdir` to a directory to which only the user running the application has access will prevent other users from accessing these temporary files.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/joniles/mpxj\n",
