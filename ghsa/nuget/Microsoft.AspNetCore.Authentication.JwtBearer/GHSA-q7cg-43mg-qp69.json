    "Description": "Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Core 2.1. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nAn information disclosure vulnerability exists in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Core 2.1 where a JWT token is logged if it cannot be parsed.\n\n### Patches\n\n* If you're using .NET 5.0, you should download and install Runtime 5.0.9 or SDK 5.0.206 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.8) or SDK 5.0.303 (for Visual Studio 2019 V16.10) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0.\n\n* If you're using .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.18 or SDK 3.1.118 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.412 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.7 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\n\n* If you're using .NET Core 2.1, you should download and install Runtime 2.1.29 or SDK 2.1.525 (for Visual Studio 2019 v15.9) or 2.1.817 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\n\n* If your application is using .NET Core 2.1 running on .NET Framework see the [Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework](#updating-2.1) section below.\n\n### \u003ca name=\"updating-2.1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\n\n#### Direct dependencies\n\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\n\n#### Transitive dependencies\n\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\n\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\n\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\n\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\n\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\n\n##### \u003ca name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eUsing Visual Studio Solution Explorer\n\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\n\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\n\n\n##### \u003ca name=\"project-assets-json\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Manually reviewing project.assets.json\n\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\n\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\n\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\n\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\n\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\n\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\n\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\n\n#### Other Details\n\n- Announcement for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/195\n- An Issue for this can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/35246\n- MSRC details for this can be found at https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34532\n",
