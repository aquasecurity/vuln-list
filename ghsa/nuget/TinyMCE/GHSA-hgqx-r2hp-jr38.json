    "Description": "### Impact\nA [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s Notification Manager API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system, which is used in error handling.  The conditions for this exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered.  \n\nWhen a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.  This issue could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display unfiltered HTML content.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed in the notification is sanitized, preventing the exploit.\n\n### Fix\nTo avoid this vulnerability:\n\n* Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.10.8 or higher for TinyMCE 5.x.\n* Upgrade to TinyMCE 6.7.1 or higher for TinyMCE 6.x.\n\n### References\n* \u003chttps://tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes5108/#securityfixes\u003e\n* \u003chttps://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.7.1-release-notes/#security-fixes\u003e\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at \u003cinfosec@tiny.cloud\u003e\n* Open an issue in the [TinyMCE repo](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)\n",
