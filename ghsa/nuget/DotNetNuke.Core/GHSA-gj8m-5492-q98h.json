    "Description": "# Summary\nUsers that can edit modules could set a title that includes scripts.\n\n# Description\nSome users (administrators and content editors) can set html in module titles and that could include javascript which could be used for XSS based attacks. With the addition of more roles being able to set module titles, this is not strictly limited to administrators. However since HTML in module titles could be a valid use case, we have added a setting for this functionality in the Security module in the Persona Bar.",
