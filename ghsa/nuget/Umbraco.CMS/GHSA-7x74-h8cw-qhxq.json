    "Description": "#### Impact\nA brute force exploit that can be used to collect valid usernames is possible.\n\n#### Explanation of the vulnerability \nIt's a brute force exploit that can be used to collect valid usernames by using the “forgot password” function when trying to log into the Backoffice.\nIf the username/email is known, it is easier to find the corresponding password.\nIf an email address that was already used and registered by a user, is provided as an input, the server internal processing time takes longer.\nIf the email address does not exist in the database of the registered users, the server would respond immediately.",
