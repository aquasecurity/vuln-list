(Chromium security severity: Critical)\n\n### References\n\n- https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4863\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863\n- https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366551978/Browser-companies-patch-critical-zero-day-vulnerability\n\n---\n**Updated**\n\nThere is another related security vulnerability. \n\n\u003e There's another related CVE ([CVE-2023-5217](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5217)) that is fixed in Chromium 117.0.5938.132. This one is triggered by WebCodecs API encoder usage, so a workaround for older versions is to disable the WebCodecs API (`--disable-blink-features=WebCodecs`).\n\nAs per https://magpcss.org/ceforum/viewtopic.php?f=6\u0026t=19551#p54150\n",
