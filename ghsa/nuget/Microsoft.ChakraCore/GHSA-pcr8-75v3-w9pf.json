    "Description": "ChakraCore and Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 1709 and Windows Server, version 1709 allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user, due to how the scripting engine handles objects in memory, aka \"Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability\". Individual Export in module exports was not taking care of destructuring nodes, leading to type confusion. This was fixed by adding support for walking those nodes.\n\nThis CVE ID is unique from CVE-2017-11836, CVE-2017-11837, CVE-2017-11838, CVE-2017-11839, CVE-2017-11840, CVE-2017-11841, CVE-2017-11843, CVE-2017-11846, CVE-2017-11858, CVE-2017-11859, CVE-2017-11861, CVE-2017-11866, CVE-2017-11869, CVE-2017-11870, CVE-2017-11871, and CVE-2017-11873.",
