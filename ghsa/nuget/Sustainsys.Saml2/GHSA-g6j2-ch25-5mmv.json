    "Description": "### Impact\nToken Replay Detection is an important defence in depth measure for Single Sign On solutions. In all previous 2.X versions, the Token Replay Detection is not properly implemented. \n\nNote that version 1.0.1 is not affected. It has a correct Token Replay Implementation and is safe to use.\n\n### Patches\nThe 2.5.0 version is patched.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds with existing versions. Fixing the issue requires code updates.\n\n### References\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Comment on #711.\n* Email us at [security@sustainsys.com](mailto:security@susatinsys.com) if you think that there are further security issues.",
