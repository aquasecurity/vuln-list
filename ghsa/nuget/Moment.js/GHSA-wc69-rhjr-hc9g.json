    "Description": "### Impact\n\n* using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs\n* noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters\n* users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks\n\n### Patches\nThe problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn general, given the proliferation of ReDoS attacks, it makes sense to limit the length of the user input to something sane, like 200 characters or less. I haven't seen legitimate cases of date-time strings longer than that, so all moment users who do pass a user-originating string to constructor are encouraged to apply such a rudimentary filter, that would help with this but also most future ReDoS vulnerabilities.\n\n### References\nThere is an excellent writeup of the issue here: https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973=\n\n### Details\nThe issue is rooted in the code that removes legacy comments (stuff inside parenthesis) from strings during rfc2822 parsing. `moment(\"(\".repeat(500000))` will take a few minutes to process, which is unacceptable.",
