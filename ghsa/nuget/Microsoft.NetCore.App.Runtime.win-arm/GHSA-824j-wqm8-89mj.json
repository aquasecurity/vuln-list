This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nA vulnerability exists in how .NET reads debugging symbols,  where reading a malicious symbols file may result in remote code execution.\n## Discussion\n\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/82112\n\n### \u003ca name=\"mitigation-factors\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMitigation factors\n\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\n\n## \u003ca name=\"affected-software\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAffected software\n\n* Any .NET 7.0 application running on .NET 7.0.2 or earlier.\n* Any .NET 6.0 application running on .NET 6.0.13 or earlier.\n\nIf your application uses the following package versions, ensure you update to the latest version of .NET.\n\n### \u003ca name=\".NET 7\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.NET 7\n\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm)|\u003e= 7.0.0, \u003c= 7.0.2|7.0.3\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm64](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm64)|\u003e= 7.0.0, \u003c= 7.0.2|7.0.3\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64)|\u003e= 7.0.0, \u003c= 7.0.2|7.0.3\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x86](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x86)|\u003e= 7.0.0, \u003c= 7.0.2|7.0.3\n\n### \u003ca name=\".NET 6\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.NET 6\n\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm)|\u003e= 6.0.0, \u003c= 6.0.13|6.0.14\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm64](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-arm64)|\u003e= 6.0.0, \u003c= 6.0.13|6.0.14\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64)|\u003e= 6.0.0, \u003c= 6.0.13|6.0.14\n[Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x86](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NetCore.App.Runtime.win-x86)|\u003e= 6.0.0, \u003c= 6.0.13|6.0.14\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### \u003ca name=\"how-affected\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### \u003ca name=\"how-fix\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow do I fix the issue?\n\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n* If you have .NET Core 3.1 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above. \n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n Version:   6.0.300\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 6.0.5\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.3 or SDK 7.0.103 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.14 or SDK 6.0.114 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.1) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\n\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update \u0026 Security and then click Check for Updates.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core \u0026 .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at \u003chttps://aka.ms/corebounty\u003e.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.
