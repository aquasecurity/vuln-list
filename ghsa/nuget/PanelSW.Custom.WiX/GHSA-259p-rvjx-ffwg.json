    "Description": "# Summary\n\n.be TEMP folder is vulnerable to DLL redirection attacks that allow the attacker to escalate privileges.\n\n# Details\n\nIf the bundle is not run as admin, the user's TEMP folder is used and not the system TEMP folder. A utility is able to monitor the user's TEMP folder for changes and drop its own DLL into the .be/.Local folder immediately when the .be folder is created. When the burn engine elevates, the malicious DLL receives elevated privileges.\n\n# PoC\n\nAs a standard, non-admin user:\n\n1.  Monitor the user's TEMP folder for changes using ReadDirectoryChangesW\n1.  On FILE_ACTION_ADDED, check if the folder name is .be\n1.  Create a folder in .be named after the bundle + .Local (e.g. MyInstaller.exe.Local)\n1.  Put the malicious COMCTL32.DLL in the .Local folder following the naming used for the real DLL (e.g. MyInstaller.exe.Local/x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_.../COMCTL32.dll)\n1.  Do hacker things when the engine escalates and the malicious DLL is loaded\n\nProper naming for the path can be obtained by using GetModuleHandle(\"comctl32.dll\") and GetModuleFileName.\n\n# Impact\n\nDLL redirection utilizing .exe.Local Windows capability. This impacts any installer built with the WiX installer framework.\n",
