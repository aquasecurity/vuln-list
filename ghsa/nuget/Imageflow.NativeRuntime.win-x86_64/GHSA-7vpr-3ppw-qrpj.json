    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability affects deployments of Imageflow that involve decoding or processing malicious source .webp files. If you only process your own trusted files, this should not affect you (but you should update anyway). \n\nImageflow relies on Google's [libwebp] library to decode .webp images, and is affected by the recent zero-day out-of-bounds write vulnerability [CVE-2023-4863](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863) and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr. The libwebp vulnerability also affects Chrome, Android, macOS, and other consumers of the library).\n\nlibwebp patched [the vulnerability](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76 ) and released [1.3.2](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/releases/tag/v1.3.2) \n\nThis was patched in [libwebp-sys in 0.9.3 and 0.9.4](https://github.com/NoXF/libwebp-sys/commits/master)\n\n**[Imageflow v2.0.0-preview8](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview8) uses the patched version of libwebp as well as updated versions of all dependencies.**\n\nNote: preview 8 requires libc 2.31 or higher on linux and macOS 11 or higher. These restrictions are due to the oldest supported versions of those platforms (which is reflected on Github Actions).\n\n### Patches\n\n**Imageflow v2.0.0-preview8 use the patched version (v1.3.2) of libwebp and libwebp-sys 0.9.4.**\n**Imageflow.AllPlatforms 0.10.2 is patched**\n**Imageflow.Server v0.8.2 is patched**\n**ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow 5.0.12 is patched**\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisable webp decoding using `EnabledCodecs::disable_decoder(NamedDecoders::WebPDecoder)` if using the Rust API. \n\nOnly files that meet the following criteria will be passed to libwebp: \n\n```rust\nbytes.starts_with(b\"RIFF\") \u0026\u0026 bytes[8..12].starts_with(b\"WEBP\")\n```\n\nYou can utilize matching logic to block webp inputs in your language of choice.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863\nhttps://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76 \nhttps://github.com/NoXF/libwebp-sys/commits/master",
