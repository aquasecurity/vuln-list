If the command timed out, set the role to '1:P' and\n  return 1 to get the node fenced.\n  The used timeout for the landscapeHostConfiguration.py call can\n  be configured by the cluster action timeout, if needed. It will\n  be 50% of the action timeout or the minimum of 300s.\n  (bsc#1198127)\n- add new HA/DR provider hook susChkSrv\n  (jsc#PED-1241, jsc#PED-1240)\n- add new tool SAPHanaSR-manageProvider to show, add and delete\n  HA/DR provider sections in the global.ini of SAP HANA.\n- update suse icon to new branding\n- Version bump to 0.160.1\n- fix HANA_CALL function to support MCOS environments again\n  (bsc#1198780)\n- fix SAPHanaSR-replay-archive to handle hb_report archives again\n  (bsc#1198897)\n- add HANA_CALL_TIMEOUT parameter back to the resource agents and\n  read the setting from the cluster configuration, if available.\n  Defaults to '60'.\n  Related to github issue#36\n- add new HA/DR provider hook susTkOver\n  (jsc#SLE-16347)\n- add new hook script for SAP HANA System Replication Scale-Up Cost\n  Optimized Scenario.\n  (jsc#SLE-18613)\n- add a new instance parameter 'REMOVE_SAP_SOCKETS'.\n  It is an optional parameter and defaults to 'true'. Now you can\n  control, if the RA should remove the unix domain sockets related\n  to sapstartsrv before (re-)start sapstartsrv or if it should try\n  to adjust the permissions and ownership of these files instead.\n\nPackage aaa_base was updated:\n\n- Drop patches (bsc#1199926 and bsc#1199927)  git-34-9a1bc15517d6da56d75182338c0f1bc4518b2b75.patch\n  git-35-91f496b1f65af29832192bad949685a7bc25da0a.patch\n  git-40-d004657a244d75b372a107c4f6097b42ba1992d5.patch\n  ping broke in sle15 and sle15sp1 when adding\n  the sysctl setting for ping_group_range\n- Add patch git-46-78b2a0b29381c16bec6b2a8fc7eabaa9925782d7.patch\n  * The wrapper rootsh is not a restricted shell (bsc#1199492)\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Security Fixes:  * Previously, there was no limit to the number of database lookups\n  performed while processing large delegations, which could be abused\n  to severely impact the performance of named running as a recursive\n  resolver.

commit c5ebdbd\n- Add dtb-microchip\n- commit c797107\n- rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: temporary workaround for a build failure\n  Upstream c6x architecture removal left a dangling link behind which\n  triggers openSUSE post-build check in kernel-source, failing\n  kernel-source build.\n  A fix deleting the danglink link has been submitted but it did not make\n  it into 5.12-rc1. Unfortunately we cannot add it as a patch as patch\n  utility does not handle symlink removal. Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master. The reason is that this can happen any time again, so\n  let's have this in packaging instead.\n- commit 52a1ad7\n- powerpc: use the generic dma_ops_bypass mode (bsc#1196472 ltc#192278).\n- Refresh patches.suse/powerpc-dma-Fix-dma_map_ops-get_required_mask.patch\n- Update config files.\n- commit 865c59d\n- dma-mapping: add a dma_ops_bypass flag to struct device (bsc#1196472 ltc#192278).\n- Refresh patches.suse/0003-kabi-Add-placeholders-to-a-couple-of-important-struc.patch.\n- blacklist.conf: Remove f1565c24b596 powerpc: use the generic dma_ops_bypass mode\n- commit 9b4bd0f\n\nPackage libassuan was updated:\n\n- update to 2.5.5:  * Fix a crash in the logging code\n  * Upgrade autoconf\n- update to 2.5.4:\n  * Fix some minor build annoyances\n- Update to 2.5.3:\n  * Add a timeout for writing to a SOCKS5 proxy.\n  * Add workaround for a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH on newer systems.\n- qemu-disable-fdpassing-test.patch: remove\n-Update to 2.5.2:\n  * configure.ac: Bump LT version to C8/A8/R2\n  * include libassuan.pc in the spec file\n\nPackage libjpeg-turbo was updated:\n\n  fix CVE-2020-35538 [bsc#1202915], Null pointer dereference in jcopy_sample_rows() function  + libjpeg-turbo-CVE-2020-35538.patch\n- security update\n- added patches\n\nPackage libjpeg62-turbo was updated:\n\n  fix CVE-2020-35538 [bsc#1202915], Null pointer dereference in jcopy_sample_rows() function  + libjpeg-turbo-CVE-2020-35538.patch\n- security update\n- added patches\n\nPackage libksba was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1204357, CVE-2022-3515]  * Detect a possible overflow directly in the TLV parser.\n  * Add libksba-CVE-2022-3515.patch\n\nPackage libtasn1 was updated:\n\n- Add libtasn1-CVE-2021-46848.patch: Fixed off-by-one array size check  that affects asn1_encode_simple_der (CVE-2021-46848, bsc#1204690).\n\nPackage libtirpc was updated:\n\n- fix CVE-2021-46828: libtirpc: DoS vulnerability with lots of  connections (bsc#1201680)\n  - backport 0001-Fix-DoS-vulnerability-in-libtirpc.patch\n- exclude ipv6 addresses in client protocol 2 code (bsc#1200800)\n  - update 0001-rpcb_clnt.c-config-to-try-protocolversion-2-first.patch\n- fix memory leak in params.r_addr assignement (bsc#1198752)\n  - add 0001-fix-parms.r_addr-memory-leak.patch\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- Security fixes:  * [CVE-2022-40303, bsc#1204366] Fix integer overflows with\n    XML_PARSE_HUGE\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40303.patch\n  * [CVE-2022-40304, bsc#1204367] Fix dict corruption caused by\n    entity reference cycles\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40304.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1201978, CVE-2016-3709]\n  * Cross-site scripting vulnerability after commit 960f0e2\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2016-3709.patch\n\nPackage libyajl was updated:\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Resolver: Fix missing --[no]-recommends initialization in  update (fixes #openSUSE/zypper#459, bsc#1201972)\n- Log ONLY_NAMESPACE_RECOMMENDED because this is what corresponds\n  to --[no]-recommends.\n- version 17.31.2 (22)\n- UsrEtc: Store logrotate files in %{_distconfdir} if defined\n  (fixes #402)\n- Log backtrace on SIGABRT too.\n- Need to explicitly enable building experimental code.

[boo#1201783]\n- update to 3.39.1:\n  * Fix an incorrect result from a query that uses a view that\n    contains a compound SELECT in which only one arm contains a\n    RIGHT JOIN and where the view is not the first FROM clause term\n    of the query that contains the view\n  * Fix a long-standing problem with ALTER TABLE RENAME that can\n    only arise if the sqlite3_limit(SQLITE_LIMIT_SQL_LENGTH) is set\n    to a very small value.\n  * Fix a long-standing problem in FTS3 that can only arise when\n    compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS compile-time\n    option.\n  * Fix the initial-prefix optimization for the REGEXP extension so\n    that it works correctly even if the prefix contains characters\n    that require a 3-byte UTF8 encoding.\n  * Enhance the sqlite_stmt virtual table so that it buffers all of\n    its output.\n- update to 3.39.0:\n  * Add (long overdue) support for RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN\n  * Add new binary comparison operators IS NOT DISTINCT FROM and\n    IS DISTINCT FROM that are equivalent to IS and IS NOT,\n    respective, for compatibility with PostgreSQL and SQL standards\n  * Add a new return code (value \u0026quot;/3\u0026quot;/) from the sqlite3_vtab_distinct()\n    interface that indicates a query that has both DISTINCT and\n    ORDER BY clauses\n  * Added the sqlite3_db_name() interface\n  * The unix os interface resolves all symbolic links in database\n    filenames to create a canonical name for the database before\n    the file is opened\n  * Defer materializing views until the materialization is actually\n    needed, thus avoiding unnecessary work if the materialization\n    turns out to never be used\n  * The HAVING clause of a SELECT statement is now allowed on any\n    aggregate query, even queries that do not have a GROUP BY\n    clause\n  * Many microoptimizations collectively reduce CPU cycles by about\n    2.3%.\n- drop sqlite-src-3380100-atof1.patch, included upstream\n- add sqlite-src-3390000-func7-pg-181.patch to skip float precision\n  related test failures on 32 bit\n- update to 3.38.5:\n  * Fix a blunder in the CLI of the 3.38.4 release\n- includes changes from 3.38.4:\n  * fix a byte-code problem in the Bloom filter pull-down\n    optimization added by release 3.38.0 in which an error in the\n    byte code causes the byte code engine to enter an infinite loop\n    when the pull-down optimization encounters a NULL key\n- update to 3.38.3:\n  * Fix a case of the query planner be overly aggressive with\n    optimizing automatic-index and Bloom-filter construction,\n    using inappropriate ON clause terms to restrict the size of the\n    automatic-index or Bloom filter, and resulting in missing rows\n    in the output.\n  * Other minor patches. See the timeline for details.\n- update to 3.38.2:\n  * Fix a problem with the Bloom filter optimization that might\n    cause an incorrect answer when doing a LEFT JOIN with a WHERE\n    clause constraint that says that one of the columns on the\n    right table of the LEFT JOIN is NULL.\n  * Other minor patches.\n- Remove obsolete configure flags\n- Package the Tcl bindings here again so that we only ship one copy\n  of SQLite (bsc#1195773).\n- update to 3.38.1:\n  * Fix problems with the new Bloom filter optimization that might\n    cause some obscure queries to get an incorrect answer.\n  * Fix the localtime modifier of the date and time functions so\n    that it preserves fractional seconds.\n  * Fix the sqlite_offset SQL function so that it works correctly\n    even in corner cases such as when the argument is a virtual\n    column or the column of a view.\n  * Fix row value IN operator constraints on virtual tables so that\n    they work correctly even if the virtual table implementation\n    relies on bytecode to filter rows that do not satisfy the\n    constraint.\n  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements, test cases, and\n    documentation. See the source code timeline for details.\n- add upstream patch to run atof1 tests only on x86_64\n  sqlite-src-3380100-atof1.patch\n- update to 3.38.0\n  * Add the -\u0026gt; and -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; operators for easier processing of JSON\n  * The JSON functions are now built-ins\n  * Enhancements to date and time functions\n  * Rename the printf() SQL function to format() for better\n    compatibility, with alias for backwards compatibility.\n  * Add the sqlite3_error_offset() interface for helping localize\n    an SQL error to a specific character in the input SQL text\n  * Enhance the interface to virtual tables\n  * CLI columnar output modes are enhanced to correctly handle tabs\n    and newlines embedded in text, and add options like \u0026quot;/--wrap N\u0026quot;/,\n    \u0026quot;/--wordwrap on\u0026quot;/, and \u0026quot;/--quote\u0026quot;/ to the columnar output modes.\n  * Query planner enhancements using a Bloom filter to speed up\n    large analytic queries, and a balanced merge tree to evaluate\n    UNION or UNION ALL compound SELECT statements that have an\n    ORDER BY clause.\n  * The ALTER TABLE statement is changed to silently ignores\n    entries in the sqlite_schema table that do not parse when\n    PRAGMA writable_schema=ON\n- update to 3.37.2:\n  * Fix a bug introduced in version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) that can\n    cause database corruption if a SAVEPOINT is rolled back while\n    in PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY mode, and other changes are made,\n    and then the outer transaction commits\n  * Fix a long-standing problem with ON DELETE CASCADE and ON\n    UPDATE CASCADE in which a cache of the bytecode used to\n    implement the cascading change was not being reset following a\n    local DDL change\n- update to 3.37.1:\n  * Fix a bug introduced by the UPSERT enhancements of version\n    3.35.0 that can cause incorrect byte-code to be generated for\n    some obscure but valid SQL, possibly resulting in a NULL-\n    pointer dereference.\n  * Fix an OOB read that can occur in FTS5 when reading corrupt\n    database files.\n  * Improved robustness of the --safe option in the CLI.\n  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements and test cases.\n- SQLite3 3.37.0:\n  * STRICT tables provide a prescriptive style of data type\n    management, for developers who prefer that kind of thing.\n  * When adding columns that contain a CHECK constraint or a\n    generated column containing a NOT NULL constraint, the\n    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN now checks new constraints against\n    preexisting rows in the database and will only proceed if no\n    constraints are violated.\n  * Added the PRAGMA table_list statement.\n  * Add the .connection command, allowing the CLI to keep multiple\n    database connections open at the same time.\n  * Add the --safe command-line option that disables dot-commands\n    and SQL statements that might cause side-effects that extend\n    beyond the single database file named on the command-line.\n  * CLI: Performance improvements when reading SQL statements that\n    span many lines.\n  * Added the sqlite3_autovacuum_pages() interface.\n  * The sqlite3_deserialize() does not and has never worked\n    for the TEMP database. That limitation is now noted in the\n    documentation.\n  * The query planner now omits ORDER BY clauses on subqueries and\n    views if removing those clauses does not change the semantics\n    of the query.\n  * The generate_series table-valued function extension is modified\n    so that the first parameter (\u0026quot;/START\u0026quot;/) is now required. This is\n    done as a way to demonstrate how to write table-valued\n    functions with required parameters. The legacy behavior is\n    available using the -DZERO_ARGUMENT_GENERATE_SERIES\n    compile-time option.\n  * Added new sqlite3_changes64() and sqlite3_total_changes64()\n    interfaces.\n  * Added the SQLITE_OPEN_EXRESCODE flag option to sqlite3_open_v2().\n  * Use less memory to hold the database schema.\n  * bsc#1189802, CVE-2021-36690: Fix an issue with the SQLite Expert\n    extension when a column has no collating sequence.\n\nPackage sudo was updated:\n\n- Added sudo-1-8-27-bsc1201462-ignore-no-sudohost.patch  * Ignore entries when converting LDAP to sudoers.

This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",

When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a request starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround: when deploying a proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard.",

      "Description": "yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf-\u003ealloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.",

      "Description": "HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn-\u003eget_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst-\u003eheader('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.",

      "Description": "TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and allows times to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular expression `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.",
