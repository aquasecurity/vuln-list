      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-12-sp4-sap-byos-v20220714-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage SAPHanaSR was updated:\n\n- Version bump to 0.155.0- The resource start and stop timeout is now configurable by\n  increasing the timeout for the action 'start' and/or 'stop'.\n  We will use 95% of this action timeouts to calculate the new\n  resource start and stop timeout for the 'WaitforStarted' and\n  'WaitforStopped' functions. If the new, calculated timeout value\n  is less than '3600', it will be set to '3600', so that we do not\n  decrease this timeout by accident\n  (bsc#1182545)\n- change promotion scoring during maintenance procedure to prevent\n  that both sides have an equal promotion scoring after refresh\n  which might result in a critical promotion of the secondary.\n  (bsc#1174557)\n- update of man page SAPHanaSR.py.7 - correct the supported HANA\n  version.\n  (bsc#1182201)\n- if the $hdbState command fails to retrieve the current state of\n  the System Replication, the resource agent now uses the\n  system_replication/actual_mode attribute (if available) from the\n  global.ini file as a fallback.\n  This should prevent some confusing and misleading log messages\n  during a takeover and solves the problem of a not working\n  takeover back (after a successful first takeover)\n  (bsc#1181765)\n- add dedicated logging of HANA_CALL problems. So it will be now\n  possible to identify, if the called hana command or the needed\n  su command throws the error and for further hints we log the\n  stderr output.\n  Additional it is possible to get regular log messages for the\n  used commands, their return code and their stderr output by\n  enabling the 'debug' mode of the resource agents.\n  (bsc#1182774)\n\nPackage audit-secondary was updated:\n\n- Fix unhandled ECONNREFUSED with LDAP environments (bsc#1196645)  * add libaudit-fix-unhandled-ECONNREFUSED-from-getpwnam-25.patch\n\nPackage augeas was updated:\n\n- add augeas-sysctl_parsing.patch (bsc#1197443)  * backport original patch\n\nPackage bash was updated:\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- When using forwarders, bogus NS records supplied by, or via, those  forwarders may be cached and used by named if it needs to recurse\n  for any reason, causing it to obtain and pass on potentially\n  incorrect answers.\n  [CVE-2021-25220, bsc#1197135, bind-9.11.37-0001-CVE-2021-25220.patch]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-revert-rela.diff to revert back to old behaviour  of not ignoring the in-section content of to be relocated\n  fields on x86-64, even though that's a RELA architecture.\n  Compatibility with buggy object files generated by old tools.\n  [bsc#1198422]\n\nPackage cifs-utils was updated:\n\n- CVE-2022-27239: mount.cifs: fix length check for ip option  parsing; (bsc#1197216) (bso#15025); CVE-2022-27239.\n  * add 0016-CVE-2022-27239-mount.cifs-fix-length-check-for-ip-op.patch\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update to version 10.0.3 (bsc#1198389)  - Descend into the extension tree even if top level module is recommended\n  - Cache license state for AHB support to detect type switch\n  - Properly clean suse.com credentials when switching from SCC to update\n    infrastructure\n  - New log message to indicate base product registration success\n- Update to version 10.0.2\n  + Fix name of logfile in error message\n  + Fix variable scoping to properly detect registration error\n  + Cleanup any artifacts on registration failure\n  + Fix latent bug with /etc/hosts population\n  + Do not throw error when attemting to unregister a system that is not\n    registered\n  + Skip extension registration if the extension is recommended by the\n    baseproduct as it gets automatically installed\n- Update to version 10.0.1 (bsc#1197113)\n  + Provide status feedback on registration, success or failure\n  + Log warning message if data provider is configured but no data\n    can be retrieved\n- Update -addon-azure to 1.0.3 follow up fix for (bsc#1195414, bsc#1195564)\n  + The repo enablement timer cannot depend on guestregister.service\n- Update -addon-azure to 1.0.2 (bsc#1196305)\n  + The is-registered() function expects a string of the update server FQDN.\n    The regionsrv-enabler-azure passed an Object of type SMT.

So move this patch\n  to later in series.conf, outside of the sorted section, making\n  series_sort.py happy.\n- commit a65cae5\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prealloc proc writes\n  (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prepare and\n  hw_params/hw_free calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent read/write and buffer\n  changes (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free\n  calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- commit 0f72275\n- macros.kernel-source: Fix conditional expansion.\n  Fixes: bb95fef3cf19 (\u0026quot;/rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\u0026quot;/)\n- commit 7e857f7\n- rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\n  Since 15.4 alternatives for /bin/sh are provided by packages\n  \u0026lt;something\u0026gt;-sh. While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 95d7e2c\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: fix packet alignment padding\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 065384f\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit f59903f\n- Update patches.suse/sr9700-sanity-check-for-packet-length.patch\n  (bac#1196836 CVE-2022-26966).\n  added CVE number\n- commit 7e940d6\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS. The suse-module-tools that provides kernel scriptlets may\n  be removed early causing migration to fail.\n- commit ab8dd2d\n- rpm: SC2006: Use $(...) notation instead of legacy backticked `...`.\n- commit f0d0e90\n- rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: call fdupes per subpackage\n  It is a waste of time to do a global fdupes when we have\n  subpackages.\n- commit 1da8439\n- net: sched: use Qdisc rcu API instead of relying on rtnl lock\n  (bsc#1196973 CVE-2021-39713).\n- net: sched: add helper function to take reference to Qdisc\n  (bsc#1196973 CVE-2021-39713).\n- net: sched: extend Qdisc with rcu (bsc#1196973 CVE-2021-39713).\n- net: sched: rename qdisc_destroy() to qdisc_put() (bsc#1196973\n  CVE-2021-39713).\n- net: core: netlink: add helper refcount dec and lock function\n  (bsc#1196973 CVE-2021-39713).\n- commit a22ecb0\n- xen/netfront: react properly to failing\n  gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() (bsc#1196488, XSA-396,\n  CVE-2022-23042).\n- commit 2b38f30\n- xen/gnttab: fix gnttab_end_foreign_access() without page\n  specified (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23041).\n- commit 7149843\n- xen/9p: use alloc/free_pages_exact() (bsc#1196488, XSA-396,\n  CVE-2022-23041).\n- commit a920e1c\n- xen/usb: don't use gnttab_end_foreign_access() in\n  xenhcd_gnttab_done() (bsc#1196488, XSA-396).\n- commit e8ca175\n- xen/gntalloc: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access()\n  (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23039).\n- commit 02e08de\n- xen/scsifront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for\n  mapped status (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23038).\n- commit 78fd62a\n- xen/netfront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for\n  mapped status (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23037).\n- commit 335a138\n- xen/blkfront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for\n  mapped status (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23036).\n- commit 69cc608\n- xen/grant-table: add gnttab_try_end_foreign_access()\n  (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23038).\n- commit d8d4a06\n- xen/xenbus: don't let xenbus_grant_ring() remove grants in\n  error case (bsc#1196488, XSA-396, CVE-2022-23040).\n- commit 9eb0e70\n- genirq: Use rcu in kstat_irqs_usr() (bsc#1193738).\n- commit b6e9db8\n- rpm/arch-symbols,guards,*driver: Replace Novell with SUSE.\n- commit 174a64f\n- usb: host: xen-hcd: add missing unlock in error path\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit af60176\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/0002-usb-Introduce-Xen-pvUSB-frontend-xen-hcd.patch.\n- commit ee8e3fd\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/0001-usb-Add-Xen-pvUSB-protocol-description.patch.\n- commit 29bb7f5\n- rpm/kernel-docs.spec.in: use %%license for license declarations\n  Limited to SLE15+ to avoid compatibility nightmares.\n- commit 73d560e\n- rpm/*.spec.in: Use https:// urls\n- commit 77b5f8e\n- sr9700: sanity check for packet length (bsc#1196836).\n- commit 7ac3395\n- nfc: st21nfca: Fix potential buffer overflows in EVT_TRANSACTION\n  (CVE-2022-26490 bsc#1196830).\n- commit 47ae8c5\n- Update patch reference for iov security fix (CVE-2022-0847 bsc#1196584)\n- commit 43f0d0b\n- net/mlx5e: Fix page DMA map/unmap attributes (bsc#1196468).\n- commit 4fdd4d6\n- kernel-binary.spec: Also exclude the kernel signing key from devel package.\n  There is a check in OBS that fails when it is included.

So\n  we do not need to handle fscks because that ain't gonna happen,\n  as well as not we do not need to handle microcode update in the\n  initrd as these only can be run on the host system anyway.

(CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714)",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-0778",
      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).",

      "Description": "yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf-\u003ealloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",
