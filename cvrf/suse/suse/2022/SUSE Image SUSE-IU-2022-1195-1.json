This support is mostly\n    handled by existing functions (dwarf_getlocation*, dwarf_getsrclines,\n    dwarf_ranges, dwarf_form*, etc.) now returning the data from the new\n    sections and data formats.  But some new functions have been added\n    to more easily get information about skeleton and split compile units\n    (dwarf_get_units and dwarf_cu_info), handle new attribute data\n    (dwarf_getabbrevattr_data) and to keep references to Dwarf_Dies\n    that might come from different sections or files (dwarf_die_addr_die).\n    Not yet supported are .dwp (Dwarf Package) and .sup (Dwarf Supplementary)\n    files, the .debug_names index, the .debug_cu_index and .debug_tu_index\n    sections.

rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: temporary workaround for a build failure\n  Upstream c6x architecture removal left a dangling link behind which\n  triggers openSUSE post-build check in kernel-source, failing\n  kernel-source build.\n  A fix deleting the danglink link has been submitted but it did not make\n  it into 5.12-rc1. Unfortunately we cannot add it as a patch as patch\n  utility does not handle symlink removal. Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master. The reason is that this can happen any time again, so\n  let's have this in packaging instead.\n- commit 52a1ad7\n- blacklist.conf: Add b4e00444cab4 fork: fix copy_process(CLONE_PARENT) race with the exiting -\u0026gt;real_parent\n- commit b1b6d4b\n\nPackage libassuan was updated:\n\n- update to 2.5.5:  * Fix a crash in the logging code\n  * Upgrade autoconf\n- update to 2.5.4:\n  * Fix some minor build annoyances\n- Update to 2.5.3:\n  * Add a timeout for writing to a SOCKS5 proxy.\n  * Add workaround for a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH on newer systems.\n- qemu-disable-fdpassing-test.patch: remove\n-Update to 2.5.2:\n  * configure.ac: Bump LT version to C8/A8/R2\n  * include libassuan.pc in the spec file\n\nPackage libgpg-error was updated:\n\n- Drop --with-pic (no effect with --disable-static).- update to 1.42:\n  * Improve cross-compiling support\n  * Improve $libdir determination by gpgrt-config\n  * Support --disable-thread by gen-lock-obj.sh\n  * Interface changes relative to the 1.40 release\n    GPG_ERR_SOURCE_TPM2D\n- update to 1.41:\n  * Fixes another glitch in the \u0026quot;/ignore\u0026quot;/ meta command.\n  * Fixes two typos in the German translation.\n  * New function gpgrt_access.\n  * Make \u0026quot;/ignore\u0026quot;/ meta command work correctly in the option parser.\n  * Interface changes relative to the 1.39 release:\n  gpgrt_access                     NEW.\n- Update to 1.39:\n  * \u0026quot;/gpg-error --lib-version\u0026quot;/ works again.\n  * New function gpgrt_fcancel as alternative to gpgrt_close.

That limitation is now noted in the\n    documentation.\n  * The query planner now omits ORDER BY clauses on subqueries and\n    views if removing those clauses does not change the semantics\n    of the query.\n  * The generate_series table-valued function extension is modified\n    so that the first parameter (\u0026quot;/START\u0026quot;/) is now required. This is\n    done as a way to demonstrate how to write table-valued\n    functions with required parameters.

At the time when Xen was developed, this area of the i386 architecture was rarely used, which is why Xen was able to use it to implement paravirtualisation, Xen's novel approach to virtualization. In AMD64, Xen had to use a different implementation approach, so Xen does not use ring 1 to support 64-bit guests. With the focus now being on 64-bit systems, and the availability of explicit hardware support for virtualization, fixing speculation issues in ring 1 is not a priority for processor companies. Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is an architectural x86 extension put together to combat speculative execution sidechannel attacks, including Spectre v2. It was retrofitted in microcode to existing CPUs. For more details on Spectre v2, see: http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html However, IBRS does not architecturally protect ring 0 from predictions learnt in ring 1. For more details, see: https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/deep-dives/deep-dive-indirect-branch-restricted-speculation Similar situations may exist with other mitigations for other kinds of speculative execution attacks.

      "Description": "yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf-\u003ealloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.",

      "Description": "When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.",
