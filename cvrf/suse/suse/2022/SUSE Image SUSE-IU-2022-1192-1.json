(bsc#1200994)\n- Remove the `WantedBy` statement from suseconnect-keepalive.service since it's only to be triggered by a systemd timer.\n- SUSEConnect will now ensure that the `PROXY_ENABLED` environment variable is honored.\n- Write services with ssl_verify=no when using connect with insecure\n- Update to 0.3.35\n- Rely on system-wide defaults for enabling the keepalive timer by systemd-presets-branding-SLE. (bsc#1200641)\n- Update to 0.3.34\n- Manage the `System-Token` header. The `System-Token` header as delivered by\n  SCC will be stored inside of the credentials file for later use on API calls.\n  This way we add system clone detection for systems using this version of SUSE\n  Connect.\n- Update to 0.3.33\n- Add --keepalive command to send pings to SCC.\n- Add service/timer to periodically call --keepalive command to make system\n  information in SCC and proxies more accurate. (bsc#1196076)\n- Update to 0.3.32\n- Allow --regcode and --instance-data attributes at the same time (jsc#PCT-164)\n- Document that 'debug' can also get set in the config file\n- --status will also print the subscription name\n\nPackage aaa_base was updated:\n\n- Add patch git-46-78b2a0b29381c16bec6b2a8fc7eabaa9925782d7.patch  * The wrapper rootsh is not a restricted shell (bsc#1199492)\n- fix (bsc#1194883) -

It is not available  on SLED or PackageHub, and it is only needed by avahi-bookmarks\n  (bsc#1196282).\n- Add avahi-bookmarks-import-warning.patch: fix warning when\n  twisted is not available.\n- Replace avahi-0.6.31-systemd-order.patch with\n  avahi-add-resolv-conf-to-inotify.patch: re-read configuration\n  when resolv.conf changes, per discussion on the bug\n  (boo#1194561).\n- Have python3-avahi require python3-dbus-python, not the\n  python 2 dbus-1-python package (bsc#1195614).\n- Reinstate avahi-0.6.31-systemd-order.patch (boo#1194561).\n  This can probably go away if/when gh#lathiat/avahi#118 is fixed.\n- Drop avahi-0.6.32-suppress-resolv-conf-warning.patch: we should\n  no longer need this given the above patch.\n- Move sftp-ssh and ssh services to the doc directory. They allow\n  a host's up/down status to be easily discovered and should not\n  be enabled by default (boo#1179060).\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Security Fixes:  * Previously, there was no limit to the number of database lookups\n  performed while processing large delegations, which could be abused\n  to severely impact the performance of named running as a recursive\n  resolver. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1203614, CVE-2022-2795, bind-CVE-2022-2795.patch]\n  * A memory leak was fixed that could be externally triggered in the\n  DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA algorithm.\n  [bsc#1203619, CVE-2022-38177, bind-CVE-2022-38177.patch]\n  * Memory leaks were fixed that could be externally triggered in the\n  DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA algorithm.\n  [bsc#1203620, CVE-2022-38178, bind-CVE-2022-38178.patch]\n- Changed ownership of /var/lib/named/master from named:named to\n  root:root.\n  [bsc#1201247, bind.conf]\n- When using forwarders, bogus NS records supplied by, or via, those\n  forwarders may be cached and used by named if it needs to recurse\n  for any reason, causing it to obtain and pass on potentially\n  incorrect answers.\n  [CVE-2021-25220, bsc#1197135, bind-9.16.27-0001-CVE-2021-25220.patch]\n- Fixed CVE-2021-25219:\n  The lame-ttl option controls how long named caches certain types\n  of broken responses from authoritative servers (see the security\n  advisory for details). This caching mechanism could be abused by\n  an attacker to significantly degrade resolver performance. The\n  vulnerability has been mitigated by changing the default value of\n  lame-ttl to 0 and overriding any explicitly set value with 0,\n  effectively disabling this mechanism altogether. ISC's testing has\n  determined that doing that has a negligible impact on resolver\n  performance while also preventing abuse.\n  Administrators may observe more traffic towards servers issuing\n  certain types of broken responses than in previous BIND 9 releases.\n  [bsc#1192146, CVE-2021-25219, bind-CVE-2021-25219.patch]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- For building shim 15.6~rc1 (and later versions) aarch64 image, objcopy  needs to support efi-app-aarch64 target. (bsc#1198458)\n  Adds binutils-add-efi-aarch64-1.diff,\n  binutils-add-efi-aarch64-2.diff, binutils-add-efi-aarch64-3.diff .\n- Add binutils-fix-keepdebug.diff for fix bsc#1191908, a problem\n  in crash not accepting some of our .ko.debug files.\n- Add binutils-revert-rela.diff to revert back to old behaviour\n  of not ignoring the in-section content of to be relocated\n  fields on x86-64, even though that's a RELA architecture.\n  Compatibility with buggy object files generated by old tools.\n  [bsc#1198422]\n- Add binutils-add-z16-name.diff so that the now official name\n  z16 for arch14 is recognized.  [bsc#1198237]\n- Add binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff for compatibility on old\n  code stream that expect 'brcl 0,label' to not be disassembled\n  as 'jgnop label' on s390x.  [bsc#1192267]\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28523 aka boo#1188941.\n- Fix empty man-pages from broken release tarball [PR28144].\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch with contained a memory corruption\n  (boo#1191473).\n- Configure with --disable-x86-used-note on old code streams.\n- Disable libalternatives temporarily for build cycle reasons.\n- make TARGET-bfd=headers again, we patch bfd-in.h\n- This state submitted to SLE12 and SLE15 code streams for annual\n  toolchain update. [jsc#PM-2767, jsc#SLE-21561, jsc#SLE-19618]\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff to 66d5c7003, to include fixes for\n  PR28422, PR28192, PR28391.  Also adds some s390x arch14\n  instructions [jsc#SLE-18637].\n- Using libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.\n- Adjust for testsuite fails on older products that configure\n  binutils in different ways, adds  binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff\n  and adjusts binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff and\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff.\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28138.\n- Use LTO \u0026amp; PGO build.\n- Update to binutils 2.37:\n  * The GNU Binutils sources now requires a C99 compiler and library to\n    build.\n  * Support for the arm-symbianelf format has been removed.\n  * Support for Realm Management Extension (RME) for AArch64 has been\n    added.\n  * A new linker option '-z report-relative-reloc' for x86 ELF targets\n    has been added to report dynamic relative relocations.\n  * A new linker option '-z start-stop-gc' has been added to disable\n    special treatment of __start_*/__stop_* references when\n  - -gc-sections.\n  * A new linker options '-Bno-symbolic' has been added which will\n    cancel the '-Bsymbolic' and '-Bsymbolic-functions' options.\n  * The readelf tool has a new command line option which can be used to\n    specify how the numeric values of symbols are reported.\n  - -sym-base=0|8|10|16 tells readelf to display the values in base 8,\n    base 10 or base 16.  A sym base of 0 represents the default action\n    of displaying values under 10000 in base 10 and values above that in\n    base 16.\n  * A new format has been added to the nm program.  Specifying\n    '--format=just-symbols' (or just using -j) will tell the program to\n    only display symbol names and nothing else.\n  * A new command line option '--keep-section-symbols' has been added to\n    objcopy and strip.  This stops the removal of unused section symbols\n    when the file is copied.  Removing these symbols saves space, but\n    sometimes they are needed by other tools.\n  * The '--weaken', '--weaken-symbol' and '--weaken-symbols' options\n    supported by objcopy now make undefined symbols weak on targets that\n    support weak symbols.\n  * Readelf and objdump can now display and use the contents of .debug_sup\n    sections.\n  * Readelf and objdump will now follow links to separate debug info\n    files by default.  This behaviour can be stopped via the use of the\n    new '-wN' or '--debug-dump=no-follow-links' options for readelf and\n    the '-WN' or '--dwarf=no-follow-links' options for objdump.  Also\n    the old behaviour can be restored by the use of the\n    '--enable-follow-debug-links=no' configure time option.\n    The semantics of the =follow-links option have also been slightly\n    changed.  When enabled, the option allows for the loading of symbol\n    tables and string tables from the separate files which can be used\n    to enhance the information displayed when dumping other sections,\n    but it does not automatically imply that information from the\n    separate files should be displayed.\n    If other debug section display options are also enabled (eg\n    '--debug-dump=info') then the contents of matching sections in both\n    the main file and the separate debuginfo file *will* be displayed.\n    This is because in most cases the debug section will only be present\n    in one of the files.\n    If however non-debug section display options are enabled (eg\n    '--sections') then the contents of matching parts of the separate\n    debuginfo file will *not* be displayed.  This is because in most\n    cases the user probably only wanted to load the symbol information\n    from the separate debuginfo file.  In order to change this behaviour\n    a new command line option --process-links can be used.  This will\n    allow di0pslay options to applied to both the main file and any\n    separate debuginfo files.\n  * Nm has a new command line option: '--quiet'.  This suppresses \u0026quot;/no\n    symbols\u0026quot;/ diagnostic.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1181452 aka CVE-2021-20197 aka PR26945\n  bnc#1183511 aka CVE-2021-20284 aka PR26931\n  bnc#1184519 aka CVE-2021-20294 aka PR26929\n  bnc#1184620 aka CVE-2021-3487 aka PR26946\n  bnc#1184794 aka CVE-2020-35448 aka PR26574\n- Also fixes:\n  bsc#1183909 - slow performance of stripping some binaries\n- Rebased patches: binutils-build-as-needed.diff, binutils-fix-abierrormsg.diff,\n  binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff, binutils-fix-relax.diff,\n  binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff, binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Removed patches (are in upstream): ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch and\n  ppc-use-local-plt.patch.\n- Add binutils-2.37-branch.diff.gz.\n- ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch: PPC: ensure_undef_dynamic\n  on weak undef only in plt\n- ppc-use-local-plt.patch: PowerPC use_local_plt (prerequisite for above\n  patch)\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which fixes PR27587.\n- Do not run make TARGET-bfd=headers separately.\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff (includes fix for PR27441 aka bsc#1182252).\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff.\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which should fix PR27311 completely.\n  It fixes also PR27284.\n- Remove temporary fix 0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Add temporary upstream fix for PR27311\n  0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Update to binutils 2.36:\n  New features in the Assembler:\n    General:\n  * When setting the link order attribute of ELF sections, it is now\n    possible to use a numeric section index instead of symbol name.\n  * Added a .nop directive to generate a single no-op instruction in\n    a target neutral manner.  This instruction does have an effect on\n    DWARF line number generation, if that is active.\n  * Removed --reduce-memory-overheads and --hash-size as gas now\n    uses hash tables that can be expand and shrink automatically.\n    X86/x86_64:\n  * Add support for AVX VNNI, HRESET, UINTR, TDX, AMX and Key\n    Locker instructions.\n  * Support non-absolute segment values for lcall and ljmp.\n  * Add {disp16} pseudo prefix to x86 assembler.\n  * Configure with --enable-x86-used-note by default for Linux/x86.\n    ARM/AArch64:\n  * Add support for Cortex-A78, Cortex-A78AE and Cortex-X1,\n    Cortex-R82, Neoverse V1, and Neoverse N2 cores.\n  * Add support for ETMv4 (Embedded Trace Macrocell), ETE (Embedded\n    Trace Extension), TRBE (Trace Buffer Extension), CSRE (Call\n    Stack Recorder Extension) and BRBE (Branch Record Buffer\n    Extension) system registers.\n  * Add support for Armv8-R and Armv8.7-A ISA extensions.\n  * Add support for DSB memory nXS barrier, WFET and WFIT\n    instruction for Armv8.7.\n  * Add support for +csre feature for -march. Add CSR PDEC\n    instruction for CSRE feature in AArch64.\n  * Add support for +flagm feature for -march in Armv8.4 AArch64.\n  * Add support for +ls64 feature for -march in Armv8.7\n    AArch64. Add atomic 64-byte load/store instructions for this\n    feature.\n  * Add support for +pauth (Pointer Authentication) feature for\n  - march in AArch64.\n    New features in the Linker:\n  * Add --error-handling-script=\u0026lt;NAME\u0026gt; command line option to allow\n    a helper script to be invoked when an undefined symbol or a\n    missing library is encountered.  This option can be suppressed\n    via the configure time switch: --enable-error-handling-script=no.\n  * Add -z x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} to the x86 ELF linker to mark\n    x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} ISA level as needed.\n  * Add -z unique-symbol to avoid duplicated local symbol names.\n  * The creation of PE format DLLs now defaults to using a more\n    secure set of DLL characteristics.\n  * The linker now deduplicates the types in .ctf sections.  The new\n    command-line option --ctf-share-types describes how to do this:\n    its default value, share-unconflicted, produces the most compact\n    output.\n  * The linker now omits the \u0026quot;/variable section\u0026quot;/ from .ctf sections\n    by default, saving space.  This is almost certainly what you\n    want unless you are working on a project that has its own\n    analogue of symbol tables that are not reflected in the ELF\n    symtabs.\n  New features in other binary tools:\n  * The ar tool's previously unused l modifier is now used for\n    specifying dependencies of a static library. The arguments of\n    this option (or --record-libdeps long form option) will be\n    stored verbatim in the __.LIBDEP member of the archive, which\n    the linker may read at link time.\n  * Readelf can now display the contents of LTO symbol table\n    sections when asked to do so via the --lto-syms command line\n    option.\n  * Readelf now accepts the -C command line option to enable the\n    demangling of symbol names.  In addition the --demangle=\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;,\n  - -no-demangle, --recurse-limit and --no-recurse-limit options\n    are also now availale.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1179898 aka CVE-2020-16590 aka PR25821\n  bnc#1179899 aka CVE-2020-16591 aka PR25822\n  bnc#1179900 aka CVE-2020-16592 aka PR25823\n  bnc#1179901 aka CVE-2020-16593 aka PR25827\n  bnc#1179902 aka CVE-2020-16598 aka PR25840\n  bnc#1179903 aka CVE-2020-16599 aka PR25842\n  bnc#1180451 aka CVE-2020-35493 aka PR25307\n  bnc#1180454 aka CVE-2020-35496 aka PR25308\n  bnc#1180461 aka CVE-2020-35507 aka PR25308\n- Rebase the following patches:\n  * binutils-fix-relax.diff\n  * binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff\n  * binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Add missing dependency on bc (ld.gold testsuite uses it).\n- Use --enable-obsolete for cross builds as ia64 is deprecated now.\n- Add binutils-2.36-branch.diff.gz.\n\nPackage blktrace was updated:\n\n- Fix crash due to dropped first event while using pipe input (bsc#1191788).  * blkparse: skip check_cpu_map with pipe input\n  * blkparse: fix incorrectly sized memset in check_cpu_map\n  * Added:\n  - blkparse-skip-check_cpu_map-with-pipe-input.patch\n  - blkparse-fix-incorrectly-sized-memset-in-check_cpu_m.patch\n\nPackage blog was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2.26  * On s390/x and PPC64 gcc misses unused arg0\n- Remove patch fcb9e0c2.patch as now part of tar ball\n- Add upstream patch fcb9e0c2.patch\n  * On s390/x and PPC64 gcc misses unused arg0\n- Update to version 2.24\n  * Avoid install errror due missed directory\n- Update to version 2.22\n  * Avoid KillMode=none for newer systemd version as well as rework\n    the systemd unit files of blog (boo#1186506)\n- Move to /usr for UsrMerge (boo#1191057)\n- Update to version 2.21\n  * Merge pull request #4 from samueldr/fix/makefile\n    Fixup Makefile for better build system support\n  * Silent new gcc compiler\n\nPackage ca-certificates-mozilla was updated:\n\n- Updated to 2.56 state of Mozilla SSL root CAs (bsc#1202868)  Added:\n  - Certainly Root E1\n  - Certainly Root R1\n  - DigiCert SMIME ECC P384 Root G5\n  - DigiCert SMIME RSA4096 Root G5\n  - DigiCert TLS ECC P384 Root G5\n  - DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5\n  - E-Tugra Global Root CA ECC v3\n  - E-Tugra Global Root CA RSA v3\n  Removed:\n  - Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2011\n- Updated to 2.54 state of Mozilla SSL root CAs (bsc#1199079)\n  Added:\n  - Autoridad de Certificacion Firmaprofesional CIF A62634068\n  - D-TRUST BR Root CA 1 2020\n  - D-TRUST EV Root CA 1 2020\n  - GlobalSign ECC Root CA R4\n  - GTS Root R1\n  - GTS Root R2\n  - GTS Root R3\n  - GTS Root R4\n  - HiPKI Root CA - G1\n  - ISRG Root X2\n  - Telia Root CA v2\n  - vTrus ECC Root CA\n  - vTrus Root CA\n  Removed:\n  - Cybertrust Global Root\n  - DST Root CA X3\n  - DigiNotar PKIoverheid CA Organisatie - G2\n  - GlobalSign ECC Root CA R4\n  - GlobalSign Root CA R2\n  - GTS Root R1\n  - GTS Root R2\n  - GTS Root R3\n  - GTS Root R4\n- updated to 2.50 state of the Mozilla NSS Certificate store (bsc#1188006)\n- Added CAs:\n  + HARICA Client ECC Root CA 2021\n  + HARICA Client RSA Root CA 2021\n  + HARICA TLS ECC Root CA 2021\n  + HARICA TLS RSA Root CA 2021\n  + TunTrust Root CA\n- Updated to 2.46 state of the Mozilla NSS Certificate store (bsc#1181994)\n- Added new root CAs:\n  - NAVER Global Root Certification Authority\n- Removed old root CA:\n  - GeoTrust Global CA\n  - GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority\n  - GeoTrust Primary Certification Authority - G3\n  - GeoTrust Universal CA\n  - GeoTrust Universal CA 2\n  - thawte Primary Root CA\n  - thawte Primary Root CA - G2\n  - thawte Primary Root CA - G3\n  - VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G4\n  - VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5\n\nPackage chrony was updated:\n\n- Fix config file handling in the spec file and remove \u0026quot;/ntsdumpdir\u0026quot;/  from default config, because augeas-lenses cannot parse it during\n  installation of SLE Micro on SLE-15-SP3 (bsc#1194220).\n- bsc#1194229: Fix pool package dependencies, so that SLE actually\n  prefers chrony-pool-suse over chrony-pool-empty.\n- Add chrony-htonl.patch to work around undocumented behaviour of\n  htonl() in older glibc versions (SLE-12) on 64 bit big endian\n  architectures (s390x).\n- SLE bugs that have been fixed in openSUSE up to this point\n  without explicit references: bsc#1183783, bsc#1184400,\n  bsc#1171806, bsc#1161119, bsc#1159840.\n- Obsoleted SLE patches:\n  * chrony-fix-open.patch\n  * chrony-gettimeofday.patch\n  * chrony-ntp-era-split.patch\n  * chrony-pidfile.patch\n  * chrony-select-timeout.patch\n  * chrony-urandom.patch\n  * chrony.sysconfig\n  * clknetsim-glibc-2.31.patch\n- boo#1190926: PrivateDevices is too strict, we might need to\n  access the rtc and ptp devices.\n- Add back support to build chrony on SLE12.\n- Drop dependency on asciidoctor.

Applications that depend on\n  exact FAT file format (e. g. embedded systems) may be broken in\n  two ways:\n  * The introduction of the alignment may create smaller images\n    than before, with a different positions of important image\n    elements. It can break existing software that expect images in\n    doststools \u0026lt;= 4.1 style.\n    To work around these problems, use \u0026quot;/-a\u0026quot;/ command line argument.\n  * The new image may contain a different geometry values. Geometry\n    sensitive applications expecting doststools \u0026lt;= 4.1 style images\n    can fails to accept different geometry values.\n    There is no direct work around for this problem. But you can\n    take the old image, use \u0026quot;/file -s $IMAGE\u0026quot;/, check its\n    \u0026quot;/sectors/track\u0026quot;/ and \u0026quot;/heads\u0026quot;/, and use them in the newly\n    introduced \u0026quot;/-g\u0026quot;/ command line argument.\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.238.gd8dbb075:  * fix(nfs): /var is not mounted during the transactional-update run (bsc#1184970)\n  * fix(nfs): give /run/rpcbind ownership to rpc user (bsc#1177461)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.234.g902e489c:\n  * fix(dracut-install): copy files preserving ownership attributes (bsc#1197967)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.232.g2ccee559:\n  * fix(dracut-systemd): do not require vconsole-setup.service (bsc#1195508)\n  * fix(dracut-functions.sh): ip route parsing (bsc#1195011)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.228.g07676562:\n  * fix(network): consistent use of \u0026quot;/$gw\u0026quot;/ for gateway (bsc#1192685)\n  * fix(install): handle builtin modules (bsc#1194716)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.224.gd285ddd8:\n  * fix(dracut.spec): change util-linux-systemd version for SLE15-SP2 (bsc#1194162)\n  * fix(dracut.spec): require util-linux-systemd (bsc#1194162)\n  * fix(url-lib): improve ca-bundle detection (bsc#1175892)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.218.gca24e614:\n  * fix(iscsi): add iscsi-init.service requirements (bsc#1193512)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.216.gf705637b:\n  * fix(iscsi): add support for the new iscsiadm \u0026quot;/no-wait\u0026quot;/ (-W) command\n  * fix(iscsi): add iscsid.service requirements\n    (bsc#1187190)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.213.g346cf20c:\n  * fix(suse): add 60-io-scheduler.rules (bsc#1188713)\n  * fix(kernel-modules): add blk_mq_alloc_disk and blk_cleanup_disk to blockfuncs (bsc#1190326)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.209.gebcf4f33:\n  * fix(systemd): add unit files for systemd-coredump (bsc#1190845)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.207.g72a93d93:\n  * fcoe/fcoe-genrules.sh: use $name instead of $env{INTERFACE} (bsc#1186260)\n  * fix: /var/lib/nfs/statd/sm is /var/lib/nfs/sm on SUSE (bsc#1184970)\n\nPackage e2fsprogs was updated:\n\n- libext2fs-add-sanity-check-to-extent-manipulation.patch: libext2fs: add  sanity check to extent manipulation (bsc#1198446 CVE-2022-1304)\n- libss-add-newer-libreadline.so.7-to-dlopen-path.patch: libss: Add support\n  for libreadline.so.7 for Leap 15.3 (bsc#1196939)\n\nPackage elfutils was updated:\n\n- Added 4G memory build constraint for aarch64 to pass testing.- Update to version 0.177 (Martin LiÅ¡ka):\n    elfclassify: New tool to analyze ELF objects.\n    readelf: Print DW_AT_data_member_location as decimal offset.\n    Decode DW_AT_discr_list block attributes.\n    libdw: Add DW_AT_GNU_numerator, DW_AT_GNU_denominator and DW_AT_GNU_bias.\n    libdwelf: Add dwelf_elf_e_machine_string.\n    dwelf_elf_begin now only returns NULL when there is an error\n    reading or decompressing a file.

Plus the new\n    DWARF5 and GNU DebugFission encodings of the existing .debug sections.\n    Also in split DWARF .dwo (DWARF object) files.  This support is mostly\n    handled by existing functions (dwarf_getlocation*, dwarf_getsrclines,\n    dwarf_ranges, dwarf_form*, etc.) now returning the data from the new\n    sections and data formats.  But some new functions have been added\n    to more easily get information about skeleton and split compile units\n    (dwarf_get_units and dwarf_cu_info), handle new attribute data\n    (dwarf_getabbrevattr_data) and to keep references to Dwarf_Dies\n    that might come from different sections or files (dwarf_die_addr_die).\n    Not yet supported are .dwp (Dwarf Package) and .sup (Dwarf Supplementary)\n    files, the .debug_names index, the .debug_cu_index and .debug_tu_index\n    sections.

Restore the commit\n- commit ee9cedc\n- rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\n  Since 15.4 alternatives for /bin/sh are provided by packages\n  \u0026lt;something\u0026gt;-sh. While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation\n  (bsc#1178134).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-warn-about-eibrs-lfence-unprivileged-ebpf-smt.patch.\n- commit 8588aa6\n- powerpc/mm: Fix verification of MMU_FTR_TYPE_44x (bsc#1156395).\n- commit 5c5db21\n- x86/speculation: Warn about eIBRS + LFENCE + Unprivileged eBPF +\n  SMT (bsc#1178134).\n- commit a719566\n- HID: multitouch: fix Dell Precision 7550 and 7750 button type\n  (bsc#1197243).\n- commit 53c2db3\n- Sort in upstreamed BHB patches\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/documentation-hw-vuln-update-spectre-doc.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-add-eibrs-retpoline-options.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-include-unprivileged-ebpf-status-in-spectre-v2-mitigation-reporting.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-rename-retpoline_amd-to-retpoline_lfence.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-use-generic-retpoline-by-default-on-amd.patch.\n- commit 4062a7a\n- s390/mm: fix VMA and page table handling code in storage key\n  handling functions (git-fixes).\n- s390/mm: validate VMA in PGSTE manipulation functions\n  (git-fixes).\n- s390/gmap: don't unconditionally call pte_unmap_unlock()\n  in __gmap_zap() (git-fixes).\n- s390/gmap: validate VMA in __gmap_zap() (git-fixes).\n- s390/pci_mmio: fully validate the VMA before calling\n  follow_pte() (git-fixes).\n- mm: add vma_lookup(), update find_vma_intersection() comments\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 808c094\n- Revert \u0026quot;/rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: call fdupes per subpackage\u0026quot;/\n  This reverts commit 1da843983718d4cfdd652a76e428abee98e37450.\n- commit f349b81\n- Revert \u0026quot;/build initrd without systemd\u0026quot;/ (bsc#1197300)\n  This reverts commit ef4c569b998635a9369390d4e9cfe3a922815c76.\n  It seems to be the cause of a stall in OBS build that resulted in\n  the failure with obs-build-qa (and possibly others).\n- commit ff2b28e\n- net/smc: Reset conn-\u0026gt;lgr when link group registration fails\n  (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: fix using of uninitialized completions (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: fix wrong list_del in smc_lgr_cleanup_early\n  (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: Fix loop in smc_listen (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: Make sure the link_id is unique (git-fixes).\n- commit 759dc2b\n- blacklist.conf: net/smc cleanup with no functional change\n- commit 5a33cbb\n- Update patch reference for USB gadget fix (CVE-2022-27223 bsc#1197245)\n- commit fd3b6e8\n- s390/hypfs: include z/VM guests with access control group set\n  (bsc#1195640 LTC#196352).\n- commit 598f26f\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 1580ab2\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 1cdc779\n- Rename colliding patches before the next cve/linux-5.3 -\u0026gt; SLE15-SP3 merge\n- commit 891ddc4\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS.

provides a 2-5% better compression ratio at very similar\n  cpu overhead. Plus this tests the zstd codepaths now as well.\n- commit 3d53a5b\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: reduce initrd functionality\n  For building in OBS, we always build inside a virtual machine\n  that gets a new, freshly created scratch filesystem image. So\n  we do not need to handle fscks because that ain't gonna happen,\n  as well as not we do not need to handle microcode update in the\n  initrd as these only can be run on the host system anyway. We\n  can also strip and hardlink as an additional optimisation that\n  should not significantly hurt.\n- commit c72c6fc\n- nvme-pci: Fix abort command id (git-fixes).\n- nvme: add command id quirk

Unfortunately we cannot add it as a patch as patch\n  utility does not handle symlink removal. Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master. The reason is that this can happen any time again, so\n  let's have this in packaging instead.\n- commit 52a1ad7\n- blacklist.conf: Add b4e00444cab4 fork: fix copy_process(CLONE_PARENT) race with the exiting -\u0026gt;real_parent\n- commit b1b6d4b\n\nPackage keyutils was updated:\n\n- Add /etc/keys/ and /usr/etc/keys/ directory (bsc#1187654)- update to 1.6.3:\n  * Revert the change notifications that were using /dev/watch_queue.\n  * Apply the change notifications that use pipe2(O_NOTIFICATION_PIPE).\n  * Allow \u0026quot;/keyctl supports\u0026quot;/ to retrieve raw capability data.\n  * Allow \u0026quot;/keyctl id\u0026quot;/ to turn a symbolic key ID into a numeric ID.\n  * Allow \u0026quot;/keyctl new_session\u0026quot;/ to name the keyring.\n  * Allow \u0026quot;/keyctl add/padd/etc.\u0026quot;/ to take hex-encoded data.\n  * Add \u0026quot;/keyctl watch*\u0026quot;/ to expose kernel change notifications on keys.\n  * Add caps for namespacing and notifications.\n  * Set a default TTL on keys that upcall for name resolution.\n  * Explicitly clear memory after it's held sensitive information.\n  * Various manual page fixes.\n  * Fix C++-related errors.\n  * Add support for keyctl_move().\n  * Add support for keyctl_capabilities().\n  * Make key=val list optional for various public-key ops.\n  * Fix system call signature for KEYCTL_PKEY_QUERY.\n  * Fix 'keyctl pkey_query' argument passing.\n  * Use keyctl_read_alloc() in dump_key_tree_aux().\n  * Various manual page fixes.\n- spec-cleaner run (fixup failing homepage url)\n- prepare usrmerge (boo#1029961)\n- updated to 1.6\n  - Apply various specfile cleanups from Fedora.\n  - request-key: Provide a command line option to suppress helper execution.\n  - request-key: Find least-wildcard match rather than first match.\n  - Remove the dependency on MIT Kerberos.\n  - Fix some error messages\n  - keyctl_dh_compute.3: Suggest /proc/crypto for list of available hashes.\n  - Fix doc and comment typos.\n  - Add public key ops for encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify (needs linux-4.20).\n  - Add pkg-config support for finding libkeyutils.\n- upstream isn't offering PGP signatures for the source tarballs anymore\n- Replace krb5-devel BuildRequires with pkgconfig(krb5): Allow OBS\n  to shortcut the ring0 bootstrap cycle by also using krb5-mini.\n- add upstream signing key and verify source signature\n- updated to 1.5.11 (bsc#1113013)\n  - Add keyring restriction support.\n  - Add KDF support to the Diffie-Helman function.\n  - DNS: Add support for AFS config files and SRV records\n\nPackage kmod was updated:\n\n- Ensure that kmod and packages linking to libkmod provide same features  (bsc#1193430).\n- Enable ZSTD on 15.3 as well (boo#1192104).\n- Only test ZSTD in testsuite on releases where it is available.\n- Enable ZSTD on 15.4 (jsc#SLE-21256).\n\nPackage krb5 was updated:\n\n- Update to 1.19.2; (jsc#SLE-23329);  * Fix a denial of service attack against the KDC encrypted challenge\n    code; (CVE-2021-36222);\n  * Fix a memory leak when gss_inquire_cred() is called without a\n    credential handle.\n- Changes from 1.19.1\n  * Fix a linking issue with Samba.\n  * Better support multiple pkinit_identities values by checking whether\n    certificates can be loaded for each value.\n- Changes from 1.19\n  Administrator experience\n  * When a client keytab is present, the GSSAPI krb5 mech will refresh\n    credentials even if the current credentials were acquired manually.\n  * It is now harder to accidentally delete the K/M entry from a KDB.\n  Developer experience\n  * gss_acquire_cred_from() now supports the \u0026quot;/password\u0026quot;/ and \u0026quot;/verify\u0026quot;/\n    options, allowing credentials to be acquired via password and\n    verified using a keytab key.\n  * When an application accepts a GSS security context, the new\n    GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG will be set if the initiator and acceptor\n    both provided matching channel bindings.\n  * Added the GSS_KRB5_NT_X509_CERT name type, allowing S4U2Self requests\n    to identify the desired client principal by certificate.\n  * PKINIT certauth modules can now cause the hw-authent flag to be set\n    in issued tickets.\n  * The krb5_init_creds_step() API will now issue the same password\n    expiration warnings as krb5_get_init_creds_password().\n  Protocol evolution\n  * Added client and KDC support for Microsoft's Resource-Based Constrained\n    Delegation, which allows cross-realm S4U2Proxy requests. A third-party\n    database module is required for KDC support.\n  * kadmin/admin is now the preferred server principal name for kadmin\n    connections, and the host-based form is no longer created by default.\n    The client will still try the host-based form as a fallback.\n  * Added client and server support for Microsoft's KERB_AP_OPTIONS_CBT\n    extension, which causes channel bindings to be required for the\n    initiator if the acceptor provided them. The client will send this\n    option if the client_aware_gss_bindings profile option is set.\n  User experience\n  * kinit will now issue a warning if the des3-cbc-sha1 encryption type is\n    used in the reply. This encryption type will be deprecated and removed\n    in future releases.\n  * Added kvno flags --out-cache, --no-store, and --cached-only\n    (inspired by Heimdal's kgetcred).\n- Changes from 1.18.3\n  * Fix a denial of service vulnerability when decoding Kerberos\n    protocol messages.\n  * Fix a locking issue with the LMDB KDB module which could cause\n    KDC and kadmind processes to lose access to the database.\n  * Fix an assertion failure when libgssapi_krb5 is repeatedly loaded\n    and unloaded while libkrb5support remains loaded.\n- Changes from 1.18.2\n  * Fix a SPNEGO regression where an acceptor using the default credential\n    would improperly filter mechanisms, causing a negotiation failure.\n  * Fix a bug where the KDC would fail to issue tickets if the local krbtgt\n    principal's first key has a single-DES enctype.\n  * Add stub functions to allow old versions of OpenSSL libcrypto to link\n    against libkrb5.\n  * Fix a NegoEx bug where the client name and delegated credential might\n    not be reported.\n- Changes from 1.18.1\n  * Fix a crash when qualifying short hostnames when the system has\n    no primary DNS domain.\n  * Fix a regression when an application imports \u0026quot;/service@\u0026quot;/ as a GSS\n    host-based name for its acceptor credential handle.\n  * Fix KDC enforcement of auth indicators when they are modified by\n    the KDB module.\n  * Fix removal of require_auth string attributes when the LDAP KDB\n    module is used.\n  * Fix a compile error when building with musl libc on Linux.\n  * Fix a compile error when building with gcc 4.x.\n  * Change the KDC constrained delegation precedence order for consistency\n    with Windows KDCs.\n- Changes from 1.18\n  Administrator experience:\n  * Remove support for single-DES encryption types.\n  * Change the replay cache format to be more efficient and robust.\n    Replay cache filenames using the new format end with \u0026quot;/.rcache2\u0026quot;/\n    by default.\n  * setuid programs will automatically ignore environment variables\n    that normally affect krb5 API functions, even if the caller does\n    not use krb5_init_secure_context().\n  * Add an \u0026quot;/enforce_ok_as_delegate\u0026quot;/ krb5.conf relation to disable\n    credential forwarding during GSSAPI authentication unless the KDC\n    sets the ok-as-delegate bit in the service ticket.\n  * Use the permitted_enctypes krb5.conf setting as the default value\n    for default_tkt_enctypes and default_tgs_enctypes.\n  Developer experience:\n  * Implement krb5_cc_remove_cred() for all credential cache types.\n  * Add the krb5_pac_get_client_info() API to get the client account\n    name from a PAC.\n  Protocol evolution:\n  * Add KDC support for S4U2Self requests where the user is identified\n    by X.509 certificate. (Requires support for certificate lookup from\n    a third-party KDB module.)\n  * Remove support for an old (\u0026quot;/draft 9\u0026quot;/) variant of PKINIT.\n  * Add support for Microsoft NegoEx. (Requires one or more third-party\n    GSS modules implementing NegoEx mechanisms.)\n  User experience:\n  * Add support for \u0026quot;/dns_canonicalize_hostname=fallback\u0026quot;/, causing\n    host-based principal names to be tried first without DNS\n    canonicalization, and again with DNS canonicalization if the\n    un-canonicalized server is not found.\n  * Expand single-component hostnames in host-based principal names\n    when DNS canonicalization is not used, adding the system's first DNS\n    search path as a suffix. Add a \u0026quot;/qualify_shortname\u0026quot;/ krb5.conf relation\n    to override this suffix or disable expansion.\n  * Honor the transited-policy-checked ticket flag on application servers,\n    eliminating the requirement to configure capaths on servers in some\n    scenarios.\n  Code quality:\n  * The libkrb5 serialization code (used to export and import krb5 GSS\n    security contexts) has been simplified and made type-safe.\n  * The libkrb5 code for creating KRB-PRIV, KRB-SAFE, and KRB-CRED\n    messages has been revised to conform to current coding practices.\n  * The test suite has been modified to work with macOS System Integrity\n    Protection enabled.\n  * The test suite incorporates soft-pkcs11 so that PKINIT PKCS11 support\n    can always be tested.\n- Changes from 1.17.1\n  * Fix a bug preventing \u0026quot;/addprinc -randkey -kvno\u0026quot;/ from working in kadmin.\n  * Fix a bug preventing time skew correction from working when a KCM\n    credential cache is used.\n- Changes from 1.17:\n  Administrator experience:\n  * A new Kerberos database module using the Lightning Memory-Mapped\n    Database library (LMDB) has been added.  The LMDB KDB module should\n    be more performant and more robust than the DB2 module, and may\n    become the default module for new databases in a future release.\n  * \u0026quot;/kdb5_util dump\u0026quot;/ will no longer dump policy entries when specific\n    principal names are requested.\n  Developer experience:\n  * The new krb5_get_etype_info() API can be used to retrieve enctype,\n    salt, and string-to-key parameters from the KDC for a client\n    principal.\n  * The new GSS_KRB5_NT_ENTERPRISE_NAME name type allows enterprise\n    principal names to be used with GSS-API functions.\n  * KDC and kadmind modules which call com_err() will now write to the\n    log file in a format more consistent with other log messages.\n  * Programs which use large numbers of memory credential caches should\n    perform better.\n  Protocol evolution:\n  * The SPAKE pre-authentication mechanism is now supported.  This\n    mechanism protects against password dictionary attacks without\n    requiring any additional infrastructure such as certificates.  SPAKE\n    is enabled by default on clients, but must be manually enabled on\n    the KDC for this release.\n  * PKINIT freshness tokens are now supported.  Freshness tokens can\n    protect against scenarios where an attacker uses temporary access to\n    a smart card to generate authentication requests for the future.\n  * Password change operations now prefer TCP over UDP, to avoid\n    spurious error messages about replays when a response packet is\n    dropped.\n  * The KDC now supports cross-realm S4U2Self requests when used with a\n    third-party KDB module such as Samba's.  The client code for\n    cross-realm S4U2Self requests is also now more robust.\n  User experience:\n  * The new ktutil addent -f flag can be used to fetch salt information\n    from the KDC for password-based keys.\n  * The new kdestroy -p option can be used to destroy a credential cache\n    within a collection by client principal name.\n  * The Kerberos man page has been restored, and documents the\n    environment variables that affect programs using the Kerberos\n    library.\n  Code quality:\n  * Python test scripts now use Python 3.\n  * Python test scripts now display markers in verbose output, making it\n    easier to find where a failure occurred within the scripts.\n  * The Windows build system has been simplified and updated to work\n    with more recent versions of Visual Studio.  A large volume of\n    unused Windows-specific code has been removed.  Visual Studio 2013\n    or later is now required.\n- Replace old $RPM_* shell vars\n- Removal of SuSEfirewall2 service since SuSEfirewall2 has been replaced\n  by firewalld\n- Remove cruft to support distributions older than SLE 12\n- Use macros where applicable\n- Switch to pkgconfig style dependencies\n- Use %_tmpfilesdir instead of the wrong %_libexecdir/tmpfiles.d\n  notation: libexecdir is likely changing away from /usr/lib to\n  /usr/libexec\n- Build with full Cyrus SASL support. Negotiating SASL credentials with\n  an EXTERNAL bind mechanism requires interaction. Kerberos provides its\n  own interaction function that skips all interaction, thus preventing the\n  mechanism from working.\n- Removed patches:\n  * 0007-krb5-1.12-ksu-path.patch\n  * 0010-Add-recursion-limit-for-ASN.1-indefinite-lengths.patch\n  * 0011-Fix-KDC-null-deref-on-bad-encrypted-challenge.patch\n- Renamed patches:\n  * 0001-krb5-1.12-pam.patch =\u0026gt; 0001-ksu-pam-integration.patch\n  * 0003-krb5-1.12-buildconf.patch =\u0026gt; 0003-Adjust-build-configuration.patch\n  * 0008-krb5-1.12-selinux-label.patch =\u0026gt; 0007-SELinux-integration.patch\n  * 0009-krb5-1.9-debuginfo.patch =\u0026gt; 0008-krb5-1.9-debuginfo.patch\n  * 0012-Fix-KDC-null-deref-on-TGS-inner-body-null-server.patch =\u0026gt;\n    0009-Fix-KDC-null-deref-on-TGS-inner-body-null-server.patch\n- Fix KDC null pointer dereference via a FAST inner body that\n  lacks a server field; (CVE-2021-37750); (bsc#1189929);\n- Added patches:\n  * 0012-Fix-KDC-null-deref-on-TGS-inner-body-null-server.patch\n\nPackage ldb was updated:\n\n- Add ldb-memory-bug-15096-4.15-ldbonly.patch to backport all  changes for ldb-2.4.4.\n  + CVE-2022-32745: samba: ldb: AD users can crash the server\n    process with an LDAP add or modify request; (bso#15008);\n    (bso#15096); (bsc#1201492).\n  + CVE-2022-2031: samba, ldb: AD users can bypass certain\n    restrictions associated with changing passwords; (bso#15047);\n    (bsc#1201495);\n  + CVE-2022-32744: samba, ldb: AD users can forge password change\n    requests for any user; (bso#15074); (bso#15047); (bsc#1201493).\n- Update to version 2.4.3\n  + Fix build problems, waf produces incorrect names for python\n    extensions; (bso#15071);\n- Update to version 2.4.2\n  + Fix for CVE-2021-3670, ensure that the LDB request has not\n    timed out during filter processing as the LDAP server\n    MaxQueryDuration is otherwise not honoured (bsc#1198397).\n- Modify packaging to allow parallel installation with libldb1\n  (bsc#1192684):\n  + Private libraries are installed in %{_libdir}/ldb2/\n  + Modules are installed in %{_libdir}/ldb2/modules\n- Update to version 2.4.1; (jsc#SLE-23329);\n  - Release 2.4.1\n    + Corrected python behaviour for 'in' for LDAP attributes\n    contained as part of ldb.Message; (bso#14845);\n    + Fix memory handling in ldb.msg_diff; (bso#14836);\n    + Corrected python docstrings\n  - Release 2.4.0\n    + Improve calculate_popt_array_length()\n    + Use C99 initializers for builtin_popt_options[]\n    + pyldb: Fix Message.items() for a message containing elements\n    + pyldb: Add test for Message.items()\n    + tests: Use ldbsearch '--scope instead of '-s'\n    + pyldb: fix a typo\n    + Change page size of guidindexpackv1.ldb\n    + Use a 1MiB lmdb so the test also passes on aarch64 CentOS stream\n    + attrib_handler casefold: simplify space dropping\n    + fix ldb_comparison_fold off-by-one overrun\n    + CVE-2020-27840: pytests: move Dn.validate test to ldb\n    + CVE-2020-27840 ldb_dn: avoid head corruption in ldb_dn_explode\n    + CVE-2021-20277 ldb/attrib_handlers casefold: stay in bounds\n    + CVE-2021-20277 ldb tests: ldb_match tests with extra spaces\n    + improve comments for ldb_module_connect_backend()\n    + test/ldb_tdb: correct introductory comments\n    + ldb.h: remove undefined async_ctx function signatures\n    + correct comments in attrib_handers val_to_int64\n    + dn tests use cmocka print functions\n    + ldb_match: remove redundant check\n    + add tests for ldb_wildcard_compare\n    + ldb_match: trailing chunk must match end of string\n    + pyldb: catch potential overflow error in py_timestring\n    + ldb: remove some 'if PY3's in tests\n    + Add missing break in switch statement\n- Drop obsolete patch CVE-2020-25718-lib-Add-hex_byte-to-replace.h.patch\n- Drop obsolete patch ldb-cve-2020-25718.patch\n- Add ldb-cve-2020-25718.patch \u0026amp;\n  CVE-2020-25718-lib-Add-hex_byte-to-replace.h.patch to backport all\n  changes from ldb-2.4.1.\n  + CVE-2020-25718: samba: An RODC can issue (forge) administrator\n    tickets to other servers; (bsc#1192246); (bso#14558)\n  + CVE-2021-3738: samba: crash in dsdb stack;\n    (bsc#1192215);(bso#14848)\n-  Release ldb 2.2.2\n  + Corrected python behaviour for 'in' for LDAP attributes\n  contained as part of ldb.Message;(bso#14845).\n  + Fix memory handling in ldb.msg_diff\n  Corrected python docstrings;(bso#14836)\n  + Backport bronze bit fixes, tests, and selftest improvements;\n  (bso#14881).\n\nPackage less was updated:\n\n- Add missing runtime dependency on which, which is used by lessopen.sh.

First reason for this is that MediaNetwork was just meant\n  as a way to test the new CURL based downloader and second: since\n  the Provide API is going to completely replace the current media\n  backend it would be extra work to ensure that changes on the\n  Downloader do not break MediaNetwork.\n- version 17.31.0 (22)\n- Fix building with GCC 12.x release (#396)\n- version 17.30.3 (22)\n- appdata plugin: Pass path to the repodata/ directory inside the\n  cache (bsc#1197684)\n- zypp-rpm: flush rpm script output buffer before sending\n  endOfScriptTag.\n- version 17.30.2 (22)\n- PluginRepoverification: initial version hooked into\n  repo::Downloader and repo refresh.\n- Immediately start monitoring the download.transfer_timeout.\n  Do not wait until the first data arrived. (bsc#1199042)\n- singletrans: no dry-run commit if doing just download-only.\n- Work around cases where sat repo.start points to an invalid\n  solvable.  May happen if (wrong arch) solvables were removed\n  at the  beginning of the repo.\n- fix misplaced #endif SINGLE_RPMTRANS_AS_DEFAULT_FOR_ZYPPER\n  (fixes #388)\n- version 17.30.1 (22)\n- ZConfig: Update solver settings if target changes (bsc#1196368)\n- version 17.30.0 (22)\n- Fix possible hang in singletrans mode (bsc#1197134)\n- Do 2 retries if mount is still busy.\n- version 17.29.7 (22)\n- Fix package signature check (bsc#1184501)\n  Pay attention that header and payload are secured by a valid\n  signature and report more detailed which signature is missing.\n- Retry umount if device is busy (bsc#1196061, closes #381)\n  A previously released ISO image may need a bit more time to\n  release it's loop device. So we wait a bit and retry.\n- Fix serializing/deserializing type mismatch in zypp-rpm\n  protocol (bsc#1196925)\n- Fix handling of ISO media in releaseAll (bsc#1196061)\n- Hint on common ptf resolver conflicts (bsc#1194848)\n- version 17.29.6 (22)\n- Hint on ptf\u0026lt;\u0026gt;patch resolver conflicts (bsc#1194848)\n- version 17.29.5 (22)\n- Fix handling of redirected command in-/output (bsc#1195326)\n  This fixes delays at the end of zypper operations, where\n  zypper unintentionally waits for appdata plugin scripts to\n  complete.\n- version 17.29.4 (22)\n- Public header files on older distros must use c++11\n  (bsc#1194597)\n- Fix exception handling when reading or writing credentials\n  (bsc#1194898)\n- version 17.29.3 (22)\n- Fix Legacy include (bsc#1194597)\n- version 17.29.2 (22)\n- Fix broken install path for parser compat headers (fixes #372,\n  bsc#1194597)\n- RepoManager: remember exec errors in exception history\n  (bsc#1193007)\n- version 17.29.1 (22)\n- Use the default zypp.conf settings if no zypp.conf exists\n  (bsc#1193488)\n- Fix wrong encoding of iso: URL components (bsc#954813)\n- Handle armv8l as armv7hl compatible userland.\n- Introduce zypp-curl a sublibrary for CURL related code.\n- zypp-rpm: Increase rpm loglevel if ZYPP_RPM_DEBUG is set.\n- Save all signatures associated with a public key in its\n  PublicKeyData.\n- version 17.29.0 (22)\n- Disable logger in the child after fork (bsc#1192436)\n- version 17.28.8 (22)\n- Check log writer before accessing it (fixes #355, bsc#1192337)\n- Save locks: Update an existing locks changed comment string.\n- Allow uname-r format in purge kernels keepspec (fixes\n  openSUSE/zypper#418)\n- version 17.28.7 (22)\n- Zypper should keep cached files if transaction is aborted\n  (bsc#1190356)\n  Singletrans mode currently does not keep files around if the\n  transaction is aborted. This patch fixes the problem.\n- Require a minimum number of mirrors for multicurl (bsc#1191609)\n- Use procfs to detect nr of open fd's if rlimit is too high\n  (bsc#1191324)\n  Especially in a VM iterating over all possible fd's to close open\n  ones right before a exec() slows down zypper unnecessarily. This\n  patch uses /proc/self/fd to iterate over open fd's in case rlimit\n  is above 1024.\n- po: Fix some lost '%' signs in positional args (bsc#1191370)\n- RepoManager: Don't probe for plaindir repo if URL schema is\n  plugin: (bsc#1191286)\n- version 17.28.6 (22)\n- Downloader does not respect checkExistsOnly flag (bsc#1190712)\n  A missing check causes zyppng::Downloader to always download full\n  files even if the checkExistsOnly flag is set. This patch adds\n  the missing logic.\n- Fix kernel-*-livepatch removal in purge-kernels (bsc#1190815)\n  The kernel-*-livepatch packages are supposed to serve as a stable\n  handle for the ephemeral kernel livepatch packages. See\n  FATE#320268 for details. As part of the kernel live patching\n  ecosystem, kernel-*-livepatch packages should not block the\n  purge-kernels step.\n- version 17.28.5 (22)\n- Make sure to keep states alives while transitioning\n  (bsc#1190199)\n- May set techpreview variables for testing in /etc/zypp/zypp.conf.\n  If environment variables are unhandy one may enable the desired\n  techpreview in zypp.conf as well:\n    [main]\n    techpreview.ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1\n    techpreview.ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1\n- version 17.28.4 (22)\n- CMake/spec: Add option to force SINGLE_RPMTRANS as default for\n  zypper (fixes #340)\n- Make sure singleTrans is zypper-only for now.\n- Do not double check signatures and keys (bsc#1190059)\n- version 17.28.3 (22)\n- Workaround Bug 1189788: Don't allow ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1 on a\n  not UsrMerged Tumbleweed system.\n- version 17.28.2 (22)\n- Fix crashes in logging code when shutting down (bsc#1189031)\n- version 17.28.1 (22)\n- Rephrase vendor conflict message in case 2 packages are\n  involved (bsc#1187760)\n  This covers the case where not the packages itself would change\n  its vendor, but replaces a package from a different vendor.\n- Fix solver jobs for PTFs (bsc#1186503)\n- spec: switch to pkgconfig(openssl)\n- Show key fpr from signature when signature check fails\n  (bsc#1187224)\n  Rpm by default only shows the short key ID when checking the\n  signature of a package fails. This patch reads the signatures\n  from the RPM headers and replaces she short IDs with the key\n  fingerprints fetched from the signatures.\n- Implement alternative single transaction commit strategy.\n  This patch adds a experimental commit strategy that runs all\n  operations in a single rpm transaction, speeding up the execution\n  a lot.\n- Use ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1 to enable the experimental new media\n  backend.\n- Implement zchunk download, refactor Downloader backend.\n- Fix purge-kernels fails with kernels from Kernel:HEAD\n  (bsc#1187738)\n  There recently was a change in the kernel package naming scheme\n  in regards to rc kernels. Since kernel upstream uses characters\n  in the version that are not allowed in rpm versions a \u0026quot;/-rc\u0026quot;/ was\n  previously replaced with \u0026quot;/.rc\u0026quot;/ which broke sorting by version, to\n  fix this issue it was replaced with \u0026quot;/~rc\u0026quot;/, which unfortunately\n  broke the purge-kernels logic. This patch makes sure purge-kernel\n  does apply the same conversion.\n- version 17.28.0 (22)\n\nPackage logrotate was updated:\n\n- Security fix: (bsc#1192449) related to (bsc#1191281, CVE-2021-3864)  * enforce stricter parsing to avoid CVE-2021-3864\n  * Added patch logrotate-enforce-stricter-parsing-and-extra-tests.patch\n- Fix \u0026quot;/logrotate emits unintended warning: keyword size not properly\n  separated, found 0x3d\u0026quot;/ (bsc#1200278, bsc#1200802):\n  * Added patch logrotate-dont_warn_on_size=_syntax.patch\n\nPackage lvm2 was updated:\n\n- udev: create symlinks and watch even in suspended state (bsc#1195231)  + bug-1195231-udev-create-symlinks-and-watch-even-in-suspended-sta.patch\n- starting with 12SP4 lvconvert no longer takes stripes option (bsc#1183905)\n  + bug-1183905_lvconvert-allow-stripes-stripesize-in-mirror-convers.patch\n- LVM vgimportclone on hardware snapshot does not work (bsc#1193181)\n  + bug-1193181_vgimportclone_on_hardware_snapshot_does_not_work.patch\n- vgextend crash when extending VG with missing PV (bsc#1191019)\n  + bug-1191019_vgextend-check-missing-device-during-block-size-chec.patch\n\nPackage mailx was updated:\n\n- Add patch mailx-12.5-systemd.patch to add description how to avoid  bugs like bsc#1192916 -- mailx does not send mails unless run via\n  strace or in verbose mode\n- fix-sendmail-name.patch: fix name argument when calling\n  /usr/sbin/sendmail [bsc#1180355].\n- Updates to mailx-12.5-openssl-1.1.0f.patch\n  * If the openssl RNG is already\n  seeded (on linux it always is) skip snake-oil reeseeding from\n  file. Update man page accordingly.\n  * Update man page with information that ssl2 and ssl3 are\n    not only deprecated but currently unavailable and that\n    tls1 forces TLS 1.0 but not later versions.\n  * RAND_EGD is also unavailable, not just unused.\n  * set SSL_OP_NO_TICKET, many servers accept session\n    tickets, but almost never rotate them properly, TLS 1.3\n    session tickets are not affected by this flag.\n  * When using client certificates, check if the cert and key\n    match each other.\n- Remove redundant %clean section.\n- Replace old $RPM_* shell vars by macros.\n\nPackage man-pages was updated:\n\n- install kernel_lockdown.7 man page [bsc#1185534]- added sources\n  + kernel_lockdown.7\n\nPackage mozilla-nspr was updated:\n\n- update to version 4.34.1  * add file descriptor sanity checks in the NSPR poll function.\n- update to version 4.34\n  * add an API that returns a preferred loopback IP on hosts that\n    have two IP stacks available.\n- update to 4.33:\n  * fixes to build system and export of private symbols\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Require libjitter only for SLE15-SP4 and greater- update to NSS 3.79.2 (bsc#1204729)\n  * bmo#1785846 - Bump minimum NSPR version to 4.34.1.\n  * bmo#1777672 - Gracefully handle null nickname in CERT_GetCertNicknameWithValidity.\n- Add nss-allow-slow-tests.patch, which allows a timed test to run\n  longer than 1s.

Furthermore, most TLS parameters can now be overriden\n    at the input() level. The notable exceptions are certificate files, something\n    that is due to be implemented as next step.\n  * 2021-06-14: new global option \u0026quot;/parser.supportCompressionExtension\u0026quot;/\n    This permits to turn off rsyslog's single-message compression extension\n    when it interferes with non-syslog message processing (the parser\n    subsystem expects syslog messages, not generic text)\n    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4598\n  * 2021-05-12: imtcp: add more override config params to input()\n    It is now possible to override all module parameters at the input() level. Module\n    parameters serve as defaults. Existing configs need no modification.\n  * 2021-05-06: imtcp: add stream driver parameter to input() configuration\n    This permits to have different inputs use different stream drivers\n    and stream driver parameters.\n    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/3727\n  * 2021-04-29: imtcp: permit to run multiple inputs in parallel\n    Previously, a single server was used to run all imtcp inputs. This\n    had a couple of drawsbacks. First and foremost, we could not use\n    different stream drivers in the varios inputs. This patch now\n    provides a baseline to do that, but does still not implement the\n    capability (in this sense it is a staging patch).\n    Secondly, we now ensure that each input has at least one exclusive\n    thread for processing, untangling the performance of multiple\n    inputs from each other.\n    see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/3727\n  * 2021-04-27: tcpsrv bugfix: potential sluggishnes and hang on shutdown\n    tcpsrv is used by multiple other modules (imtcp, imdiag, imgssapi, and,\n    in theory, also others - even ones we do not know about). However, the\n    internal synchornization did not properly take multiple tcpsrv users\n    in consideration.\n    As such, a single user could hang under some circumstances. This was\n    caused by improperly awaking all users from a pthread condition wait.\n    That in turn could lead to some sluggish behaviour and, in rare cases,\n    a hang at shutdown.\n    Note: it was highly unlikely to experience real problems with the\n    officially provided modules.\n  * 2021-04-22: refactoring of syslog/tcp driver parameter passing\n    This has now been generalized to a parameter block, which makes it much cleaner and\n    also easier to add new parameters in the future.\n  * 2021-04-22: config script: add re_match_i() and re_extract_i() functions\n    This provides case-insensitive regex functionality.\n    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4429\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2104.0:\n  * rainerscript: call getgrnam_r repeatedly to get all group members\n    (bsc#1178490)\n  * new contributed module imhiredis\n  * new built-in function get_property() to access property vars\n  * mmdblookup: add support for mmdb DB reload on HUP\n  * script bugfix: empty array in foreach() improperly handled\n  * imjournal bugfixes (handle leak, empty file)\n  * new contributed function module fmunflatten\n  * test bugfix: some tests did not work with newer TLS library versions\n  * some improvements to project CI\n- update remote.conf example file to new 'Address' and 'Port' notation\n  (bsc#1182653)\n- HTTPS URLs used for source\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2102.0:\n  * omfwd: add stats counter for sent bytes\n  * omfwd: add error reporting configuration option\n  * action stats counter bugfix: failure count was not properly incremented\n  * action stats counter bugfix: resume count was not incremented\n  * omfwd bugfix: segfault or error if port not given\n  * lookup table bugfix: data race on lookup table reload\n  * testbench modernization\n  * testbench: fix invalid sequence of kafka tests runs\n  * testbench: fix kafkacat issues\n  * testbench: fix year-dependendt clickhouse test\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2012.0:\n  * testbench bugfix: some tests did not work in make distcheck\n  * immark: rewrite with many improvements\n  * usability: re-phrase error message to help users better understand cause\n  * add new system property $now-unixtimestamp\n  * omfwd: add new rate limit option\n  * omfwd bug: param \u0026quot;/StreamDriver.PermitExpiredCerts\u0026quot;/ is not \u0026quot;/off\u0026quot;/ by default\n- prepare usrmerge (boo#1029961)\n- remove legacy stuff from specfile\n  * sysvinit is not supported anymore, so remove all tests\n    related to systemv in the specfile\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2010.0:\n  * gnutls TLS subsystem bugfix: handshake error handling\n  * core/msg bugfix: memory leak\n  * core/msg bugfix: segfault in jsonPathFindNext() when \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;

Due to a regression\n    in v1.1.3, the DeviceAllow=char-pts rwm rule was no longer added and\n    was causing an error open /dev/pts/0: operation not permitted: unknown when systemd was reloaded.\n    (boo#1202821)\n- Update to runc v1.1.3. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.3.\n  (Includes a fix for bsc#1200088.)\n  * Our seccomp `-ENOSYS` stub now correctly handles multiplexed syscalls on\n    s390 and s390x. This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not\n    support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub\n    code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).\n  * Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as\n    intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for\n    libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.\n  * Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate\n    constants in libseccomp-golang.\n  * When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,\n    to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.\n  * Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.\n  * Various CI fixes.\n  * Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.\n  * runc static binaries are now linked against libseccomp v2.5.4.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3474\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with newer syscalls (namely faccessat2) on older kernels on s390(x) caused by\n  that platform's syscall multiplexing semantics. bsc#1192051 bsc#1199565\n  + bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Add ExcludeArch for s390 (not s390x) since we've never supported it.\n- Update to runc v1.1.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2.\n  CVE-2022-29162 bsc#1199460\n  * A bug was found in runc where runc exec --cap executed processes with\n    non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux\n    environment. For more information, see [GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66][] and\n    CVE-2022-29162. bsc#1199460\n  * `runc spec` no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created\n    example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.\n- Update to runc v1.1.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.1.\n  * runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,\n    rather than error out. (#3355)\n  * runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)\n    libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files\n    listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's\n    cgroup. (#3387, #3404)\n  * Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus \u0026quot;/Intel RDT is not supported\u0026quot;/\n    error. (#3406)\n  * libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat\n    of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n  - libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being\n    correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This\n    should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and\n    incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0~rc1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.\n  + Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.\n  * runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.\n    This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures\n    (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent\n    binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.\n  + runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.\n    This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after\n    the container hasï¿¼exited.\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD\n    (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows\n    users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be\n    efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.\n  + checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set\n    a different LSM mount context on restore.\n  + intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.\n  + runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup\n    to use for the process being executed.\n  + cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1\n    machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc\n    run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).\n  + sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s\n    behaviour.\n  + mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching\n    the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any\n    additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to\n    have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have\n    restrictive access control settings for other users.\n  + Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These\n    have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r\n    to the option name (such as rro).\n  + Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features\n    runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as\n    supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this\n    command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc\n    1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is\n    being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.\n  * system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.\n  * cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change\n    the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per\n    /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container\n    process.\n  * runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount\n    which destination is a symlink.\n  * cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.\n    runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused\n    container.\n  * runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of\n    exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.\n- Update version data embedded in binary to correctly include the git commit of\n  the release.\n- Drop runc-rpmlintrc because we don't have runc-test anymore.\n- Update to runc v1.0.3. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.3. CVE-2021-43784\n  bsc#1193436\n  * A potential vulnerability was discovered in runc (related to an internal\n    usage of netlink), however upon further investigation we discovered that\n    while this bug was exploitable on the master branch of runc, no released\n    version of runc could be exploited using this bug. The exploit required\n    being able to create a netlink attribute with a length that would overflow a\n    uint16 but this was not possible in any released version of runc. For more\n    information see GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f and CVE-2021-43784.\n    Due to an abundance of caution we decided to do an emergency release with\n    this fix, but to reiterate we do not believe this vulnerability was\n    possible to exploit. Thanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for\n    discovering and reporting this vulnerability so quickly.\n  * Fixed inability to start a container with read-write bind mount of a\n    read-only fuse host mount.\n  * Fixed inability to start when read-only /dev in set in spec.\n  * Fixed not removing sub-cgroups upon container delete, when rootless cgroup\n    v2 is used with older systemd.\n  * Fixed returning error from GetStats when hugetlb is unsupported (which\n    causes excessive logging for kubernetes).\n- Update to runc v1.0.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2\n  * Fixed a failure to set CPU quota period in some cases on cgroup v1.\n  * Fixed the inability to start a container with the \u0026quot;/adding seccomp filter\n    rule for syscall ...\u0026quot;/ error, caused by redundant seccomp rules (i.e. those\n    that has action equal to the default one). Such redundant rules are now\n    skipped.\n  * Made release builds reproducible from now on.\n  * Fixed a rare debug log race in runc init, which can result in occasional\n    harmful \u0026quot;/failed to decode ...\u0026quot;/ errors from runc run or exec.\n  * Fixed the check in cgroup v1 systemd manager if a container needs to be\n    frozen before Set, and add a setting to skip such freeze unconditionally.\n    The previous fix for that issue, done in runc 1.0.1, was not working.\n- Update to runc v1.0.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.1\n  * Fixed occasional runc exec/run failure (\u0026quot;/interrupted system call\u0026quot;/) on an\n    Azure volume.\n  * Fixed \u0026quot;/unable to find groups ... token too long\u0026quot;/ error with /etc/group\n    containing lines longer than 64K characters.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v1: fix leaving cgroup frozen after Set if a parent cgroup is\n    frozen. This is a regression in 1.0.0, not affecting runc itself but some\n    of libcontainer users (e.g Kubernetes).\n  * cgroupv2: bpf: Ignore inaccessible existing programs in case of\n    permission error when handling replacement of existing bpf cgroup\n    programs. This fixes a regression in 1.0.0, where some SELinux\n    policies would block runc from being able to run entirely.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v2: don't freeze cgroup on Set.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v1: avoid unnecessary freeze on Set.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  + boo1187704-0001-cgroupv2-ebpf-ignore-inaccessible-existing-programs.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3055\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with runc under openSUSE MicroOS's SELinux policy. boo#1187704\n  + boo1187704-0001-cgroupv2-ebpf-ignore-inaccessible-existing-programs.patch\n- Update to runc v1.0.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n  ! The usage of relative paths for mountpoints will now produce a warning\n    (such configurations are outside of the spec, and in future runc will\n    produce an error when given such configurations).\n  * cgroupv2: devices: rework the filter generation to produce consistent\n    results with cgroupv1, and always clobber any existing eBPF\n    program(s) to fix runc update and avoid leaking eBPF programs\n    (resulting in errors when managing containers).\n  * cgroupv2: correctly convert \u0026quot;/number of IOs\u0026quot;/ statistics in a\n    cgroupv1-compatible way.\n  * cgroupv2: support larger than 32-bit IO statistics on 32-bit architectures.\n  * cgroupv2: wait for freeze to finish before returning from the freezing\n    code, optimize the method for checking whether a cgroup is frozen.\n  * cgroups/systemd: fixed \u0026quot;/retry on dbus disconnect\u0026quot;/ logic introduced in rc94\n  * cgroups/systemd: fixed returning \u0026quot;/unit already exists\u0026quot;/ error from a systemd\n    cgroup manager (regression in rc94)\n  + cgroupv2: support SkipDevices with systemd driver\n  + cgroup/systemd: return, not ignore, stop unit error from Destroy\n  + Make \u0026quot;/runc --version\u0026quot;/ output sane even when built with go get or\n    otherwise outside of our build scripts.\n  + cgroups: set SkipDevices during runc update (so we don't modify\n    cgroups at all during runc update).\n  + cgroup1: blkio: support BFQ weights.\n  + cgroupv2: set per-device io weights if BFQ IO scheduler is available.\n- Update to runc v1.0.0~rc95. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95\n  This release of runc contains a fix for CVE-2021-30465, and users are\n  strongly recommended to update (especially if you are providing\n  semi-limited access to spawn containers to untrusted users). bsc#1185405\n- Update to runc v1.0.0~rc94. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc94\n  Breaking Changes:\n  * cgroupv1: kernel memory limits are now always ignored, as kmemcg has\n    been effectively deprecated by the kernel. Users should make use of regular\n    memory cgroup controls.\n  Regression Fixes:\n  * seccomp: fix 32-bit compilation errors\n  * runc init: fix a hang caused by deadlock in seccomp/ebpf loading

That limitation is now noted in the\n    documentation.\n  * The query planner now omits ORDER BY clauses on subqueries and\n    views if removing those clauses does not change the semantics\n    of the query.\n  * The generate_series table-valued function extension is modified\n    so that the first parameter (\u0026quot;/START\u0026quot;/) is now required. This is\n    done as a way to demonstrate how to write table-valued\n    functions with required parameters.

When listing, extractng and comparing, zstd compressed\n    archives are recognized automatically. When '-a' option is in\n    effect, zstd compression is selected if the destination archive\n    name ends in '.zst' or '.tzst'.\n  * The -K option interacts properly with member names given in the\n    command line. Names of members to extract can be specified along\n    with the \u0026quot;/-K NAME\u0026quot;/ option. In this case, tar will extract NAME\n    and those of named members that appear in the archive after it,\n    which is consistent with the semantics of the option. Previous\n    versions of tar extracted NAME, those of named members that\n    appeared before it, and everything after it.\n  * Fix CVE-2018-20482 - When creating archives with the --sparse\n    option, previous versions of tar would loop endlessly if a\n    sparse file had been truncated while being archived.\n- remove the following patches (upstreamed)\n  * tar-1.30-tests-difflink.patch\n  * tar-1.30-tests_dirrem_race.patch\n- refresh add_readme-tests.patch\n- add tar-1.31-tests_dirrem.patch to fix expected output in dirrem\n  tests\n- add tar-1.31-racy_compress_tests.patch to fix compression tests\n\nPackage targetcli-fb was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2.1.54:  * version 2.1.54\n  * fileio backstore: fix sparse file creation\n  * Do not install systemd files in setup.py\n  Removing the need for our patch fix-setup-install.patch,\n  since that managed systemd file locations, now handled\n  in the SPEC file.

At the time when Xen was developed, this area of the i386 architecture was rarely used, which is why Xen was able to use it to implement paravirtualisation, Xen's novel approach to virtualization. In AMD64, Xen had to use a different implementation approach, so Xen does not use ring 1 to support 64-bit guests. With the focus now being on 64-bit systems, and the availability of explicit hardware support for virtualization, fixing speculation issues in ring 1 is not a priority for processor companies. Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is an architectural x86 extension put together to combat speculative execution sidechannel attacks, including Spectre v2. It was retrofitted in microcode to existing CPUs. For more details on Spectre v2, see: http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html However, IBRS does not architecturally protect ring 0 from predictions learnt in ring 1. For more details, see: https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/deep-dives/deep-dive-indirect-branch-restricted-speculation Similar situations may exist with other mitigations for other kinds of speculative execution attacks.

Guests are permitted to control certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specified via page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). In some cases the hypervisor carries out the requests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error handling in certain PoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success of some operations was not properly accounted for. There are two code paths affected - page removal (CVE-2021-28705) and insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one patch which combines the fix to both issues.)",

In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-0778",
      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",

These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.",
