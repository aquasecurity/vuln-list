In 9.13, TSIG support was\n  removed from dnssec-keygen, so now it is just for DNSKEY (and KEY\n  for obscure cases). tsig-keygen is now used to generate DDNS keys.\n  [bsc#1187921, vendor-files.tar.bz2]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff for compatibility on old  code stream that expect 'brcl 0,label' to not be disassembled\n  as 'jgnop label' on s390x.  [bsc#1192267]\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28523 aka boo#1188941.\n- Fix empty man-pages from broken release tarball [PR28144].\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch with contained a memory corruption\n  (boo#1191473).\n- Configure with --disable-x86-used-note on old code streams.\n- Disable libalternatives temporarily for build cycle reasons.\n- make TARGET-bfd=headers again, we patch bfd-in.h\n- This state submitted to SLE12 and SLE15 code streams for annual\n  toolchain update. [jsc#PM-2767, jsc#SLE-21561, jsc#SLE-19618]\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff to 66d5c7003, to include fixes for\n  PR28422, PR28192, PR28391.  Also adds some s390x arch14\n  instructions [jsc#SLE-18637].\n- Using libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.\n- Adjust for testsuite fails on older products that configure\n  binutils in different ways, adds  binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff\n  and adjusts binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff and\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff.\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28138.\n- Use LTO \u0026amp; PGO build.\n- Update to binutils 2.37:\n  * The GNU Binutils sources now requires a C99 compiler and library to\n    build.\n  * Support for the arm-symbianelf format has been removed.\n  * Support for Realm Management Extension (RME) for AArch64 has been\n    added.\n  * A new linker option '-z report-relative-reloc' for x86 ELF targets\n    has been added to report dynamic relative relocations.\n  * A new linker option '-z start-stop-gc' has been added to disable\n    special treatment of __start_*/__stop_* references when\n  - -gc-sections.\n  * A new linker options '-Bno-symbolic' has been added which will\n    cancel the '-Bsymbolic' and '-Bsymbolic-functions' options.\n  * The readelf tool has a new command line option which can be used to\n    specify how the numeric values of symbols are reported.\n  - -sym-base=0|8|10|16 tells readelf to display the values in base 8,\n    base 10 or base 16.  A sym base of 0 represents the default action\n    of displaying values under 10000 in base 10 and values above that in\n    base 16.\n  * A new format has been added to the nm program.  Specifying\n    '--format=just-symbols' (or just using -j) will tell the program to\n    only display symbol names and nothing else.\n  * A new command line option '--keep-section-symbols' has been added to\n    objcopy and strip.  This stops the removal of unused section symbols\n    when the file is copied.  Removing these symbols saves space, but\n    sometimes they are needed by other tools.\n  * The '--weaken', '--weaken-symbol' and '--weaken-symbols' options\n    supported by objcopy now make undefined symbols weak on targets that\n    support weak symbols.\n  * Readelf and objdump can now display and use the contents of .debug_sup\n    sections.\n  * Readelf and objdump will now follow links to separate debug info\n    files by default.  This behaviour can be stopped via the use of the\n    new '-wN' or '--debug-dump=no-follow-links' options for readelf and\n    the '-WN' or '--dwarf=no-follow-links' options for objdump.  Also\n    the old behaviour can be restored by the use of the\n    '--enable-follow-debug-links=no' configure time option.\n    The semantics of the =follow-links option have also been slightly\n    changed.  When enabled, the option allows for the loading of symbol\n    tables and string tables from the separate files which can be used\n    to enhance the information displayed when dumping other sections,\n    but it does not automatically imply that information from the\n    separate files should be displayed.\n    If other debug section display options are also enabled (eg\n    '--debug-dump=info') then the contents of matching sections in both\n    the main file and the separate debuginfo file *will* be displayed.\n    This is because in most cases the debug section will only be present\n    in one of the files.\n    If however non-debug section display options are enabled (eg\n    '--sections') then the contents of matching parts of the separate\n    debuginfo file will *not* be displayed.  This is because in most\n    cases the user probably only wanted to load the symbol information\n    from the separate debuginfo file.  In order to change this behaviour\n    a new command line option --process-links can be used.  This will\n    allow di0pslay options to applied to both the main file and any\n    separate debuginfo files.\n  * Nm has a new command line option: '--quiet'.  This suppresses \u0026quot;/no\n    symbols\u0026quot;/ diagnostic.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1181452 aka CVE-2021-20197 aka PR26945\n  bnc#1183511 aka CVE-2021-20284 aka PR26931\n  bnc#1184519 aka CVE-2021-20294 aka PR26929\n  bnc#1184620 aka CVE-2021-3487 aka PR26946\n  bnc#1184794 aka CVE-2020-35448 aka PR26574\n- Also fixes:\n  bsc#1183909 - slow performance of stripping some binaries\n- Rebased patches: binutils-build-as-needed.diff, binutils-fix-abierrormsg.diff,\n  binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff, binutils-fix-relax.diff,\n  binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff, binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Removed patches (are in upstream): ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch and\n  ppc-use-local-plt.patch.\n- Add binutils-2.37-branch.diff.gz.\n- ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch: PPC: ensure_undef_dynamic\n  on weak undef only in plt\n- ppc-use-local-plt.patch: PowerPC use_local_plt (prerequisite for above\n  patch)\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which fixes PR27587.\n- Do not run make TARGET-bfd=headers separately.\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff (includes fix for PR27441 aka bsc#1182252).\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff.\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which should fix PR27311 completely.\n  It fixes also PR27284.\n- Remove temporary fix 0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Add temporary upstream fix for PR27311\n  0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Update to binutils 2.36:\n  New features in the Assembler:\n    General:\n  * When setting the link order attribute of ELF sections, it is now\n    possible to use a numeric section index instead of symbol name.\n  * Added a .nop directive to generate a single no-op instruction in\n    a target neutral manner.  This instruction does have an effect on\n    DWARF line number generation, if that is active.\n  * Removed --reduce-memory-overheads and --hash-size as gas now\n    uses hash tables that can be expand and shrink automatically.\n    X86/x86_64:\n  * Add support for AVX VNNI, HRESET, UINTR, TDX, AMX and Key\n    Locker instructions.\n  * Support non-absolute segment values for lcall and ljmp.\n  * Add {disp16} pseudo prefix to x86 assembler.\n  * Configure with --enable-x86-used-note by default for Linux/x86.\n    ARM/AArch64:\n  * Add support for Cortex-A78, Cortex-A78AE and Cortex-X1,\n    Cortex-R82, Neoverse V1, and Neoverse N2 cores.\n  * Add support for ETMv4 (Embedded Trace Macrocell), ETE (Embedded\n    Trace Extension), TRBE (Trace Buffer Extension), CSRE (Call\n    Stack Recorder Extension) and BRBE (Branch Record Buffer\n    Extension) system registers.\n  * Add support for Armv8-R and Armv8.7-A ISA extensions.\n  * Add support for DSB memory nXS barrier, WFET and WFIT\n    instruction for Armv8.7.\n  * Add support for +csre feature for -march. Add CSR PDEC\n    instruction for CSRE feature in AArch64.\n  * Add support for +flagm feature for -march in Armv8.4 AArch64.\n  * Add support for +ls64 feature for -march in Armv8.7\n    AArch64. Add atomic 64-byte load/store instructions for this\n    feature.\n  * Add support for +pauth (Pointer Authentication) feature for\n  - march in AArch64.\n    New features in the Linker:\n  * Add --error-handling-script=\u0026lt;NAME\u0026gt; command line option to allow\n    a helper script to be invoked when an undefined symbol or a\n    missing library is encountered.  This option can be suppressed\n    via the configure time switch: --enable-error-handling-script=no.\n  * Add -z x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} to the x86 ELF linker to mark\n    x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} ISA level as needed.\n  * Add -z unique-symbol to avoid duplicated local symbol names.\n  * The creation of PE format DLLs now defaults to using a more\n    secure set of DLL characteristics.\n  * The linker now deduplicates the types in .ctf sections.  The new\n    command-line option --ctf-share-types describes how to do this:\n    its default value, share-unconflicted, produces the most compact\n    output.\n  * The linker now omits the \u0026quot;/variable section\u0026quot;/ from .ctf sections\n    by default, saving space.  This is almost certainly what you\n    want unless you are working on a project that has its own\n    analogue of symbol tables that are not reflected in the ELF\n    symtabs.\n  New features in other binary tools:\n  * The ar tool's previously unused l modifier is now used for\n    specifying dependencies of a static library. The arguments of\n    this option (or --record-libdeps long form option) will be\n    stored verbatim in the __.LIBDEP member of the archive, which\n    the linker may read at link time.\n  * Readelf can now display the contents of LTO symbol table\n    sections when asked to do so via the --lto-syms command line\n    option.\n  * Readelf now accepts the -C command line option to enable the\n    demangling of symbol names.  In addition the --demangle=\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;,\n  - -no-demangle, --recurse-limit and --no-recurse-limit options\n    are also now availale.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1179898 aka CVE-2020-16590 aka PR25821\n  bnc#1179899 aka CVE-2020-16591 aka PR25822\n  bnc#1179900 aka CVE-2020-16592 aka PR25823\n  bnc#1179901 aka CVE-2020-16593 aka PR25827\n  bnc#1179902 aka CVE-2020-16598 aka PR25840\n  bnc#1179903 aka CVE-2020-16599 aka PR25842\n  bnc#1180451 aka CVE-2020-35493 aka PR25307\n  bnc#1180454 aka CVE-2020-35496 aka PR25308\n  bnc#1180461 aka CVE-2020-35507 aka PR25308\n- Rebase the following patches:\n  * binutils-fix-relax.diff\n  * binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff\n  * binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Add missing dependency on bc (ld.gold testsuite uses it).\n- Use --enable-obsolete for cross builds as ia64 is deprecated now.\n- Add binutils-2.36-branch.diff.gz.\n\nPackage blktrace was updated:\n\n- Fix crash due to dropped first event while using pipe input (bsc#1191788).  * blkparse: skip check_cpu_map with pipe input\n  * blkparse: fix incorrectly sized memset in check_cpu_map\n  * Added:\n  - blkparse-skip-check_cpu_map-with-pipe-input.patch\n  - blkparse-fix-incorrectly-sized-memset-in-check_cpu_m.patch\n\nPackage brotli was updated:\n\n- Fix CVE-2020-8927, decoder: integer overflow when input chunk  is larger than 2GiB.

Applications that depend on\n  exact FAT file format (e. g. embedded systems) may be broken in\n  two ways:\n  * The introduction of the alignment may create smaller images\n    than before, with a different positions of important image\n    elements. It can break existing software that expect images in\n    doststools \u0026lt;= 4.1 style.\n    To work around these problems, use \u0026quot;/-a\u0026quot;/ command line argument.\n  * The new image may contain a different geometry values. Geometry\n    sensitive applications expecting doststools \u0026lt;= 4.1 style images\n    can fails to accept different geometry values.\n    There is no direct work around for this problem. But you can\n    take the old image, use \u0026quot;/file -s $IMAGE\u0026quot;/, check its\n    \u0026quot;/sectors/track\u0026quot;/ and \u0026quot;/heads\u0026quot;/, and use them in the newly\n    introduced \u0026quot;/-g\u0026quot;/ command line argument.\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.224.gd285ddd8:  * fix(dracut.spec): change util-linux-systemd version for SLE15-SP2 (bsc#1194162)\n  * fix(dracut.spec): require util-linux-systemd (bsc#1194162)\n  * fix(url-lib): improve ca-bundle detection (bsc#1175892)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.218.gca24e614:\n  * fix(iscsi): add iscsi-init.service requirements (bsc#1193512)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.216.gf705637b:\n  * fix(iscsi): add support for the new iscsiadm \u0026quot;/no-wait\u0026quot;/ (-W) command\n  * fix(iscsi): add iscsid.service requirements\n    (bsc#1187190)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.213.g346cf20c:\n  * fix(suse): add 60-io-scheduler.rules (bsc#1188713)\n  * fix(kernel-modules): add blk_mq_alloc_disk and blk_cleanup_disk to blockfuncs (bsc#1190326)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.209.gebcf4f33:\n  * fix(systemd): add unit files for systemd-coredump (bsc#1190845)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.207.g72a93d93:\n  * fcoe/fcoe-genrules.sh: use $name instead of $env{INTERFACE} (bsc#1186260)\n  * fix: /var/lib/nfs/statd/sm is /var/lib/nfs/sm on SUSE (bsc#1184970)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.203.g8ee14a90:\n  * fix(suse-initrd): use $kernel rather than $(uname -r)\n  * fix(suse-initrd): exclude modules that are built-in (bsc#1185646)\n  * fix(suse-initrd): inform on usage of obsolete -f parameter (bsc#1187470)\n  * docs: fix reference to insmodpost module (bsc#1187774)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.196.g8706843b:\n  * fix(suse-initrd): restore INITRD_MODULES in mkinitrd script\n  * fix(suse-initrd): call dracut_instmods with hostonly=\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.192.g00425ead:\n  * fix(suse-initrd): remove references to INITRD_MODULES (bsc#1187115)\n  * fix(suse-initrd) fix list of modprobe.d directories\n  * fix(install): handle $LIB in ldd output parsing (bsc#1185615)\n\nPackage efibootmgr was updated:\n\nPackage file was updated:\n\nPackage gcc was updated:\n\n- With gcc-PIE add -pie even when -fPIC is specified but we are  not linking a shared library.

It does not affect SLE15-SP3 directly since our\n  configs always enable CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU_SVM, but it's in the incorrect\n  place in general. Move it outside of the ifdef to match upstream behavior.\n- commit e39afe2\n- timers: Fix get_next_timer_interrupt() with no timers pending (git-fixes)\n- commit 1045d0d\n- docs: virt/kvm: close

If boot is a separate partition, a copy is\n  used instead of a link.\n  The logic for /boot/vmlinuz and /boot/initrd doesn't change with\n  this patch.\n- Use /usr/lib/modules as module dir when

Fix bsc#1190552.\n\nPackage libesmtp was updated:\n\n- Add libesmtp-fix-cve-2019-19977.patch: Fix stack-based buffer  over-read in ntlm/ntlmstruct.c (bsc#1160462 bsc#1189097).\n\nPackage libgcrypt was updated:\n\n- FIPS: Fix gcry_mpi_sub_ui subtraction [bsc#1193480]  * gcry_mpi_sub_ui: fix subtracting from negative value\n  * Add libgcrypt-FIPS-fix-gcry_mpi_sub_ui.patch\n\nPackage libsolv was updated:\n\n- fix misparsing of '\u0026amp;' in attributes with libxml2- choice rules: treat orphaned packages as newest [bsc#1190465]\n- fix compatibility with Python 3.10\n- new SOLVER_EXCLUDEFROMWEAK job type\n- support for environments in comps parser\n- bump version to 0.7.20\n- Disable python2 usage on suse_version \u0026gt;= 1550 by default (still\n  possible to use osc build --with=python).\n\nPackage libstorage-ng was updated:\n\n- prefer file system over empty MS-DOS partition table (bsc#1186823)- 4.3.109\n\nPackage libyui was updated:\n\n- Fixed crash in NCurses online update when retracted packages  are present (bsc#1191130)\n- 4.1.5\n- Fixed using an uninitialized variable, in some situations\n  the patch category could be missing in the Qt UI (bsc#1174390)\n- 4.1.4\n- Obsolete older -doc packages in all main packages that have them\n  to prevent outdated -doc packages being installed (bsc#1184363)\n- 4.1.3\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Disable logger in the child after fork (bsc#1192436)- version 17.28.8 (22)\n- Check log writer before accessing it (fixes #355, bsc#1192337)\n- Save locks: Update an existing locks changed comment string.\n- Allow uname-r format in purge kernels keepspec (fixes\n  openSUSE/zypper#418)\n- version 17.28.7 (22)\n- Zypper should keep cached files if transaction is aborted\n  (bsc#1190356)\n  Singletrans mode currently does not keep files around if the\n  transaction is aborted. This patch fixes the problem.\n- Require a minimum number of mirrors for multicurl (bsc#1191609)\n- Use procfs to detect nr of open fd's if rlimit is too high\n  (bsc#1191324)\n  Especially in a VM iterating over all possible fd's to close open\n  ones right before a exec() slows down zypper unnecessarily. This\n  patch uses /proc/self/fd to iterate over open fd's in case rlimit\n  is above 1024.\n- po: Fix some lost '%' signs in positional args (bsc#1191370)\n- RepoManager: Don't probe for plaindir repo if URL schema is\n  plugin: (bsc#1191286)\n- version 17.28.6 (22)\n- Downloader does not respect checkExistsOnly flag (bsc#1190712)\n  A missing check causes zyppng::Downloader to always download full\n  files even if the checkExistsOnly flag is set. This patch adds\n  the missing logic.\n- Fix kernel-*-livepatch removal in purge-kernels (bsc#1190815)\n  The kernel-*-livepatch packages are supposed to serve as a stable\n  handle for the ephemeral kernel livepatch packages. See\n  FATE#320268 for details. As part of the kernel live patching\n  ecosystem, kernel-*-livepatch packages should not block the\n  purge-kernels step.\n- version 17.28.5 (22)\n- Make sure to keep states alives while transitioning\n  (bsc#1190199)\n- May set techpreview variables for testing in /etc/zypp/zypp.conf.\n  If environment variables are unhandy one may enable the desired\n  techpreview in zypp.conf as well:\n    [main]\n    techpreview.ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1\n    techpreview.ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1\n- version 17.28.4 (22)\n- CMake/spec: Add option to force SINGLE_RPMTRANS as default for\n  zypper (fixes #340)\n- Make sure singleTrans is zypper-only for now.\n- Do not double check signatures and keys (bsc#1190059)\n- version 17.28.3 (22)\n- Workaround Bug 1189788: Don't allow ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1 on a\n  not UsrMerged Tumbleweed system.\n- version 17.28.2 (22)\n- Fix crashes in logging code when shutting down (bsc#1189031)\n- version 17.28.1 (22)\n- Rephrase vendor conflict message in case 2 packages are\n  involved (bsc#1187760)\n  This covers the case where not the packages itself would change\n  its vendor, but replaces a package from a different vendor.\n- Fix solver jobs for PTFs (bsc#1186503)\n- spec: switch to pkgconfig(openssl)\n- Show key fpr from signature when signature check fails\n  (bsc#1187224)\n  Rpm by default only shows the short key ID when checking the\n  signature of a package fails. This patch reads the signatures\n  from the RPM headers and replaces she short IDs with the key\n  fingerprints fetched from the signatures.\n- Implement alternative single transaction commit strategy.\n  This patch adds a experimental commit strategy that runs all\n  operations in a single rpm transaction, speeding up the execution\n  a lot.\n- Use ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1 to enable the experimental new media\n  backend.\n- Implement zchunk download, refactor Downloader backend.\n- Fix purge-kernels fails with kernels from Kernel:HEAD\n  (bsc#1187738)\n  There recently was a change in the kernel package naming scheme\n  in regards to rc kernels. Since kernel upstream uses characters\n  in the version that are not allowed in rpm versions a \u0026quot;/-rc\u0026quot;/ was\n  previously replaced with \u0026quot;/.rc\u0026quot;/ which broke sorting by version, to\n  fix this issue it was replaced with \u0026quot;/~rc\u0026quot;/, which unfortunately\n  broke the purge-kernels logic. This patch makes sure purge-kernel\n  does apply the same conversion.\n- version 17.28.0 (22)\n\nPackage lvm2 was updated:\n\n- starting with 12SP4 lvconvert no longer takes stripes option (bsc#1183905)  + bug-1183905_lvconvert-allow-stripes-stripesize-in-mirror-convers.patch\n- LVM vgimportclone on hardware snapshot does not work (bsc#1193181)\n  + bug-1193181_vgimportclone_on_hardware_snapshot_does_not_work.patch\n- vgextend crash when extending VG with missing PV (bsc#1191019)\n  + bug-1191019_vgextend-check-missing-device-during-block-size-chec.patch\n\nPackage mailx was updated:\n\n- Add patch mailx-12.5-systemd.patch to add description how to avoid  bugs like bsc#1192916 -- mailx does not send mails unless run via\n  strace or in verbose mode\n- fix-sendmail-name.patch: fix name argument when calling\n  /usr/sbin/sendmail [bsc#1180355].\n- Updates to mailx-12.5-openssl-1.1.0f.patch\n  * If the openssl RNG is already\n  seeded (on linux it always is) skip snake-oil reeseeding from\n  file. Update man page accordingly.\n  * Update man page with information that ssl2 and ssl3 are\n    not only deprecated but currently unavailable and that\n    tls1 forces TLS 1.0 but not later versions.\n  * RAND_EGD is also unavailable, not just unused.\n  * set SSL_OP_NO_TICKET, many servers accept session\n    tickets, but almost never rotate them properly, TLS 1.3\n    session tickets are not affected by this flag.\n  * When using client certificates, check if the cert and key\n    match each other.\n- Remove redundant %clean section.\n- Replace old $RPM_* shell vars by macros.\n\nPackage man-pages was updated:\n\n- install kernel_lockdown.7 man page [bsc#1185534]- added sources\n  + kernel_lockdown.7\n\nPackage mozilla-nspr was updated:\n\n- update to version 4.32:  * implement new socket option PR_SockOpt_DontFrag\n  * support larger DNS records by increasing the default buffer\n    size for DNS queries\n- update to version 4.31:\n  * Lock access to PRCallOnceType members in PR_CallOnce* for\n    thread safety bmo#1686138\n- update to version 4.30\n  * support longer thread names on macOS\n  * fix a build failure on OpenBSD\n- update to version 4.29\n  * Remove macOS Code Fragment Manager support code\n  * Remove XP_MACOSX and OS_TARGET=MacOSX\n  * Refresh config.guess and config.sub\n  * Remove NSPR's patch to config.sub\n  * Add support for e2k target (64-bit Elbrus 2000)\n- update to version 4.28\n  * Fix a compiler warning\n  * Add rule for cross-compiling with cygwin\n- update to version 4.27\n  * the macOS platform code for shared library loading was\n  * An include statement for a Windows system library header\n    was added\n- update to version 4.26\n  * PR_GetSystemInfo supports a new flag PR_SI_RELEASE_BUILD to get\n    information about the operating system build version.\n  * Better support parallel building on Windows.\n  * The internal release automatic script requires python 3.\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Mozilla NSS 3.68.2 (bsc#1193845)  * mozilla::pkix: support SHA-2 hashes in CertIDs in OCSP responses\n    (bmo#966856)\n- Mozilla NSS 3.68.1\n  MFSA 2021-51 (bsc#1193170)\n  * CVE-2021-43527 (bmo#1737470)\n    Memory corruption via DER-encoded DSA and RSA-PSS signatures\n- Remove now obsolete patch nss-bsc1193170.patch\n- Add patch to fix CVE-2021-43527 (bsc#1193170):\n  nss-bsc1193170.patch\n- Removed nss-fips-kdf-self-tests.patch.

For example, for the pattern /(?=(a))1?b/, \u0026quot;/b\u0026quot;/ was incorrectly set\n  as the first character of a match.\n  * Fix out-of-bounds read for partial matching of /./ against an empty string\n  when the newline type is CRLF.\n  * When matching using the the REG_STARTEND feature of the POSIX API with a\n  non-zero starting offset, unset capturing groups with lower numbers than a\n  group that did capture something were not being correctly returned as \u0026quot;/unset\u0026quot;/\n  (that is, with offset values of -1).\n  * Matching the pattern /(*UTF)C[^v]+x80/ against an 8-bit string\n  containing multi-code-unit characters caused bad behaviour and possibly a\n  crash. This issue was fixed for other kinds of repeat in release 8.37 by change\n  38, but repeating character classes were overlooked.\n\nPackage pcre2 was updated:\n\n- Added 0001-Fixed-atomic-group-backtracking-bug.patch  * bsc#1187937\n  * PHP 7.6.4 on s390x returns different results for preg_match\n    function as compared to older PHP versions and x86\n  * Sourced from upstream subversion commit:\n    $ svn log -r965 svn://vcs.pcre.org/pcre2/code/trunk\n\nPackage perl-Bootloader was updated:\n\n- merge gh#openSUSE/perl-bootloader#136- report error if config file could not be updated (bsc#1188768)\n- 0.936\n- merge gh#openSUSE/perl-bootloader#135\n- fix typo in update-bootloader\n- 0.935\n\nPackage permissions was updated:\n\n  * drop ping capabilities in favor of ICMP_PROTO sockets (bsc#1174504)- Update to version 20181225:\n\nPackage pixman was updated:\n\nPackage polkit-default-privs was updated:\n\n- Update to version 13.2+20210813.1c5fb05:  * malcontent: loosen restrictive ReadOwn actions to prevent spurious auth requests (#56) (#57)\n- Update to version 13.2+20210811.0c80127:\n  * whitelisting of GNOME malcontent parental controls (bsc#1177974) (#55)\n\nPackage python was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2019-20907_tarfile-inf-loop.patch fixing bsc#1174091  (CVE-2019-20907, bpo#39017) avoiding possible infinite loop\n  in specifically crafted tarball.\n  Add recursion.tar as a testing tarball for the patch.\n- Provide the newest setuptools wheel (bsc#1176262,\n  CVE-2019-20916) in their correct form (bsc#1180686).\n- Add CVE-2020-26116-httplib-header-injection.patch fixing bsc#1177211\n  (CVE-2020-26116, bpo#39603) no longer allowing special characters in\n  the method parameter of HTTPConnection.putrequest in httplib, stopping\n  injection of headers.

This patch now\n    provides a baseline to do that, but does still not implement the\n    capability (in this sense it is a staging patch).\n    Secondly, we now ensure that each input has at least one exclusive\n    thread for processing, untangling the performance of multiple\n    inputs from each other.\n    see also: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/3727\n  * 2021-04-27: tcpsrv bugfix: potential sluggishnes and hang on shutdown\n    tcpsrv is used by multiple other modules (imtcp, imdiag, imgssapi, and,\n    in theory, also others - even ones we do not know about). However, the\n    internal synchornization did not properly take multiple tcpsrv users\n    in consideration.\n    As such, a single user could hang under some circumstances. This was\n    caused by improperly awaking all users from a pthread condition wait.\n    That in turn could lead to some sluggish behaviour and, in rare cases,\n    a hang at shutdown.\n    Note: it was highly unlikely to experience real problems with the\n    officially provided modules.\n  * 2021-04-22: refactoring of syslog/tcp driver parameter passing\n    This has now been generalized to a parameter block, which makes it much cleaner and\n    also easier to add new parameters in the future.\n  * 2021-04-22: config script: add re_match_i() and re_extract_i() functions\n    This provides case-insensitive regex functionality.\n    closes https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/4429\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2104.0:\n  * rainerscript: call getgrnam_r repeatedly to get all group members\n    (bsc#1178490)\n  * new contributed module imhiredis\n  * new built-in function get_property() to access property vars\n  * mmdblookup: add support for mmdb DB reload on HUP\n  * script bugfix: empty array in foreach() improperly handled\n  * imjournal bugfixes (handle leak, empty file)\n  * new contributed function module fmunflatten\n  * test bugfix: some tests did not work with newer TLS library versions\n  * some improvements to project CI\n- update remote.conf example file to new 'Address' and 'Port' notation\n  (bsc#1182653)\n- HTTPS URLs used for source\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2102.0:\n  * omfwd: add stats counter for sent bytes\n  * omfwd: add error reporting configuration option\n  * action stats counter bugfix: failure count was not properly incremented\n  * action stats counter bugfix: resume count was not incremented\n  * omfwd bugfix: segfault or error if port not given\n  * lookup table bugfix: data race on lookup table reload\n  * testbench modernization\n  * testbench: fix invalid sequence of kafka tests runs\n  * testbench: fix kafkacat issues\n  * testbench: fix year-dependendt clickhouse test\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2012.0:\n  * testbench bugfix: some tests did not work in make distcheck\n  * immark: rewrite with many improvements\n  * usability: re-phrase error message to help users better understand cause\n  * add new system property $now-unixtimestamp\n  * omfwd: add new rate limit option\n  * omfwd bug: param \u0026quot;/StreamDriver.PermitExpiredCerts\u0026quot;/ is not \u0026quot;/off\u0026quot;/ by default\n- prepare usrmerge (boo#1029961)\n- remove legacy stuff from specfile\n  * sysvinit is not supported anymore, so remove all tests\n    related to systemv in the specfile\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2010.0:\n  * gnutls TLS subsystem bugfix: handshake error handling\n  * core/msg bugfix: memory leak\n  * core/msg bugfix: segfault in jsonPathFindNext() when \u0026lt;root\u0026gt; not an object\n  * openssl TLS subsystem: improvments of error and status messages\n  * add 'exists()' script function to check if variable exists\n  * core bugfix: do not create empty JSON objects on non-existent key access\n  * gnutls subsysem bugfix: potential hang on session closure\n  * core/network bugfix: obey net.enableDNS=off when querying local hostname\n  * core bugfix: potential segfault on query of PROGRAMNAME property\n  * imtcp bugfix: broken connection not necessariy detected\n  * new module: imhttp - http input\n  * mmdarwin bugfix: potential zero uuid when reusing existing one\n  * imdocker bugfix: build issue on some platforms\n  * omudpspoof bugfix: make compatbile with Solaris build\n  * testbench fix: python 3 incompatibility\n  * core bugfix: segfault if disk-queue file cannot be created\n  * cosmetic: fix dummy module name in debug output\n  * config bugfix: intended warning emitted as error\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2008.0\n  Way too many changes since 8.39.0 to be listed here.\n- Added custom unit file rsyslog.service because\n  systemd service file was removed from upstream project\n- Removed obsolete patches:\n  * 0001-satisfy-gcc-flag-fno-common.patch\n  * rsyslog-pgsql-pkg-config.patch\n  * rsyslog-unit.patch\n- Use systemd_ordering instead of requiring to make rsyslog useable\n  in containers.\n- Fix the URL for bug reporting, should not point to novell.com\n  (bsc#1173433)\n- Add support for omkafka which is now in Factory, and 15.x repos\n- avoid build error with gcc flag -fno-common (bsc#1160414)\n  * add 0001-satisfy-gcc-flag-fno-common.patch\n\nPackage ruby2 was updated:\n\nAdd patches to fix the following CVE's:  - CVE-2021-32066.patch (CVE-2021-32066): Fix StartTLS stripping\n    vulnerability in Net:IMAP (bsc#1188160)\n  - CVE-2021-31810.patch (CVE-2021-31810): Fix trusting FTP PASV\n    responses vulnerability in  Net:FTP (bsc#1188161)\n  - CVE-2021-31799.patch (CVE-2021-31799): Fix Command injection\n    vulnerability in RDoc (bsc#1190375)\n\nPackage runc was updated:\n\n- Update to runc v1.0.3. Upstream changelog is available from  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.3. CVE-2021-43784\n  (bsc#1193436)\n  * A potential vulnerability was discovered in runc (related to an internal\n    usage of netlink), however upon further investigation we discovered that\n    while this bug was exploitable on the master branch of runc, no released\n    version of runc could be exploited using this bug. The exploit required\n    being able to create a netlink attribute with a length that would overflow a\n    uint16 but this was not possible in any released version of runc. For more\n    information see GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f and CVE-2021-43784.\n    Due to an abundance of caution we decided to do an emergency release with\n    this fix, but to reiterate we do not believe this vulnerability was\n    possible to exploit. Thanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for\n    discovering and reporting this vulnerability so quickly.\n  * Fixed inability to start a container with read-write bind mount of a\n    read-only fuse host mount.\n  * Fixed inability to start when read-only /dev in set in spec.\n  * Fixed not removing sub-cgroups upon container delete, when rootless cgroup\n    v2 is used with older systemd.\n  * Fixed returning error from GetStats when hugetlb is unsupported (which\n    causes excessive logging for kubernetes).\n- Update to runc v1.0.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2\n  * Fixed a failure to set CPU quota period in some cases on cgroup v1.\n  * Fixed the inability to start a container with the \u0026quot;/adding seccomp filter\n    rule for syscall ...\u0026quot;/ error, caused by redundant seccomp rules (i.e. those\n    that has action equal to the default one). Such redundant rules are now\n    skipped.\n  * Made release builds reproducible from now on.\n  * Fixed a rare debug log race in runc init, which can result in occasional\n    harmful \u0026quot;/failed to decode ...\u0026quot;/ errors from runc run or exec.\n  * Fixed the check in cgroup v1 systemd manager if a container needs to be\n    frozen before Set, and add a setting to skip such freeze unconditionally.\n    The previous fix for that issue, done in runc 1.0.1, was not working.\n- Update to runc v1.0.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.1\n  * Fixed occasional runc exec/run failure (\u0026quot;/interrupted system call\u0026quot;/) on an\n    Azure volume.\n  * Fixed \u0026quot;/unable to find groups ... token too long\u0026quot;/ error with /etc/group\n    containing lines longer than 64K characters.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v1: fix leaving cgroup frozen after Set if a parent cgroup is\n    frozen. This is a regression in 1.0.0, not affecting runc itself but some\n    of libcontainer users (e.g Kubernetes).\n  * cgroupv2: bpf: Ignore inaccessible existing programs in case of\n    permission error when handling replacement of existing bpf cgroup\n    programs. This fixes a regression in 1.0.0, where some SELinux\n    policies would block runc from being able to run entirely.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v2: don't freeze cgroup on Set.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v1: avoid unnecessary freeze on Set.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  + boo1187704-0001-cgroupv2-ebpf-ignore-inaccessible-existing-programs.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3055\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with runc under openSUSE MicroOS's SELinux policy. boo#1187704\n  + boo1187704-0001-cgroupv2-ebpf-ignore-inaccessible-existing-programs.patch\n- Update to runc v1.0.0.

The usage of relative paths for mountpoints will now produce a warning\n    (such configurations are outside of the spec, and in future runc will\n    produce an error when given such configurations).\n  * cgroupv2: devices: rework the filter generation to produce consistent\n    results with cgroupv1, and always clobber any existing eBPF\n    program(s) to fix runc update and avoid leaking eBPF programs\n    (resulting in errors when managing containers).\n  * cgroupv2: correctly convert \u0026quot;/number of IOs\u0026quot;/ statistics in a\n    cgroupv1-compatible way.\n  * cgroupv2: support larger than 32-bit IO statistics on 32-bit architectures.\n  * cgroupv2: wait for freeze to finish before returning from the freezing\n    code, optimize the method for checking whether a cgroup is frozen.\n  * cgroups/systemd: fixed \u0026quot;/retry on dbus disconnect\u0026quot;/ logic introduced in rc94\n  * cgroups/systemd: fixed returning \u0026quot;/unit already exists\u0026quot;/ error from a systemd\n    cgroup manager (regression in rc94)\n  + cgroupv2: support SkipDevices with systemd driver\n  + cgroup/systemd: return, not ignore, stop unit error from Destroy\n  + Make \u0026quot;/runc --version\u0026quot;/ output sane even when built with go get or\n    otherwise outside of our build scripts.\n  + cgroups: set SkipDevices during runc update (so we don't modify\n    cgroups at all during runc update).\n  + cgroup1: blkio: support BFQ weights.\n  + cgroupv2: set per-device io weights if BFQ IO scheduler is available.\n- Update to runc v1.0.0~rc95. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95\n  This release of runc contains a fix for CVE-2021-30465, and users are\n  strongly recommended to update (especially if you are providing\n  semi-limited access to spawn containers to untrusted users). bsc#1185405\n- Update to runc v1.0.0~rc94. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc94\n  Breaking Changes:\n  * cgroupv1: kernel memory limits are now always ignored, as kmemcg has\n    been effectively deprecated by the kernel. Users should make use of regular\n    memory cgroup controls.\n  Regression Fixes:\n  * seccomp: fix 32-bit compilation errors\n  * runc init: fix a hang caused by deadlock in seccomp/ebpf loading code\n  * runc start: fix \u0026quot;/chdir to cwd: permission denied\u0026quot;/ for some setups\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - 0001-cloned_binary-switch-from-error-to-warning-for-SYS_m.patch\n    syscalls unusable for glibc.\n\nPackage samba was updated:\n\n- The username map [script] advice from CVE-2020-25717 advisory  note has undesired side effects for the local nt token.

A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations.

That is, when operating in this mode, a guest has two tables. As a result, guests also need to be able to retrieve the addresses that the new status tracking table can be accessed through. For 32-bit guests on x86, translation of requests has to occur because the interface structure layouts commonly differ between 32- and 64-bit. The translation of the request to obtain the frame numbers of the grant status table involves translating the resulting array of frame numbers. Since the space used to carry out the translation is limited, the translation layer tells the core function the capacity of the array within translation space. Unfortunately the core function then only enforces array bounds to be below 8 times the specified value, and would write past the available space if enough frame numbers needed storing.",

The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).",

      "CVE": "CVE-2021-3712",
      "Description": "ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

      "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.",
