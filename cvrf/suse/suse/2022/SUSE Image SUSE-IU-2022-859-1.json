As it adds the check a bit later than\n  upstream fix, it did not cause a conflict so nobody noticed the duplicity.\n- commit ef08708\n- llc: fix netdevice reference leaks in llc_ui_bind() (git-fixes).\n- commit 2237578\n- can: mcba_usb: mcba_usb_start_xmit(): fix double dev_kfree_skb\n  in error path (CVE-2022-28389 bsc#1198033).\n- can: usb_8dev: usb_8dev_start_xmit(): fix double dev_kfree_skb()\n  in error path (CVE-2022-28388 bsc#1198032).\n- can: ems_usb: ems_usb_start_xmit(): fix double dev_kfree_skb()\n  in error path (CVE-2022-28390 bsc#1198031).\n- commit d6e6523\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix potential AB/BA lock with buffer_mutex and\n  mmap_lock (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- Refresh\n  patches.kabi/ALSA-kABI-workaround-for-snd_pcm_runtime-changes.patch.\n- commit db7647d\n- net: sched: fix use-after-free in tc_new_tfilter()\n  (CVE-2022-1055 bsc#1197702).\n- commit 4c7dc78\n- Add CVE tags to\n  patches.suse/ext4-fix-kernel-infoleak-via-ext4_extent_header.patch\n  (bsc#1189562 bsc#1196761 CVE-2022-0850).\n- commit f3cb08f\n- powerpc/mm/numa: skip NUMA_NO_NODE onlining in\n  parse_numa_properties() (bsc#1179639 ltc#189002 git-fixes).\n- commit 73583c9\n- esp: Fix possible buffer overflow in ESP transformation\n  (bsc#1197131 CVE-2022-0886 CVE-2022-27666).\n- commit 39a5891\n- cifs: use the correct max-length for dentry_path_raw()\n  (bsc1196196).\n- commit 10cddb2\n- quota: check block number when reading the block in quota file\n  (bsc#1197366 CVE-2021-45868).\n- commit a7d4915\n- netfilter: conntrack: don't refresh sctp entries in closed state\n  (bsc#1197389).\n- commit c3afd15\n- ALSA: kABI workaround for snd_pcm_runtime changes (CVE-2022-1048\n  bsc#1197331).\n- commit 12628f8\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prealloc proc writes\n  (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prepare and\n  hw_params/hw_free calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent read/write and buffer\n  changes (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free\n  calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- commit aee063f\n- rpm/constraints.in: skip SLOW_DISK workers for kernel-source\n- commit e84694f\n- macros.kernel-source: Fix conditional expansion.\n  Fixes: bb95fef3cf19 (\u0026quot;/rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\u0026quot;/)\n- commit 7e857f7\n- rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\n  Since 15.4 alternatives for /bin/sh are provided by packages\n  \u0026lt;something\u0026gt;-sh. While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 1580ab2\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 1cdc779\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS.

Upstream changelog is available from  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.3.\n  (Includes a fix for bsc#1200088.)\n  * Our seccomp `-ENOSYS` stub now correctly handles multiplexed syscalls on\n    s390 and s390x. This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not\n    support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub\n    code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).\n  * Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as\n    intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for\n    libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.\n  * Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate\n    constants in libseccomp-golang.\n  * When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,\n    to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.\n  * Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.\n  * Various CI fixes.\n  * Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.\n  * runc static binaries are now linked against libseccomp v2.5.4.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3474\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with newer syscalls (namely faccessat2) on older kernels on s390(x) caused by\n  that platform's syscall multiplexing semantics. bsc#1192051 bsc#1199565\n  + bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Add ExcludeArch for s390 (not s390x) since we've never supported it.\n- Update to runc v1.1.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2.\n  CVE-2022-29162 bsc#1199460\n  * A bug was found in runc where runc exec --cap executed processes with\n    non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux\n    environment. For more information, see [GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66][] and\n    CVE-2022-29162. bsc#1199460\n  * `runc spec` no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created\n    example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.\n- Update to runc v1.1.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.1.\n  * runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,\n    rather than error out. (#3355)\n  * runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)\n    libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files\n    listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's\n    cgroup. (#3387, #3404)\n  * Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus \u0026quot;/Intel RDT is not supported\u0026quot;/\n    error. (#3406)\n  * libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat\n    of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n  - libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being\n    correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This\n    should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and\n    incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0~rc1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.\n  + Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.\n  * runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.\n    This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures\n    (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent\n    binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.\n  + runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.\n    This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after\n    the container hasÃ¯Â¿Â¼exited.\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD\n    (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows\n    users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be\n    efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.\n  + checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set\n    a different LSM mount context on restore.\n  + intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.\n  + runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup\n    to use for the process being executed.\n  + cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1\n    machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc\n    run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).\n  + sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s\n    behaviour.\n  + mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching\n    the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any\n    additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to\n    have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have\n    restrictive access control settings for other users.\n  + Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These\n    have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r\n    to the option name (such as rro).\n  + Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features\n    runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as\n    supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this\n    command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc\n    1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is\n    being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.\n  * system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.\n  * cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change\n    the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per\n    /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container\n    process.\n  * runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount\n    which destination is a symlink.\n  * cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.\n    runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused\n    container.\n  * runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of\n    exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.\n- Update version data embedded in binary to correctly include the git commit of\n  the release.\n- Drop runc-rpmlintrc because we don't have runc-test anymore.\n  bsc#1193436\n\nPackage samba was updated:\n\n- Adjust systemd tmpfiles.d configuration, use /run/samba instead of  /var/run/samba; (bsc#1134046);\n- CVE-2021-44142: Out-of-Bound Read/Write on Samba vfs_fruit\n  module; (bsc#1194859); (bso#14914).\n\nPackage sudo was updated:\n\n- Add support in the LDAP filter for negated users, patch taken  from upstream (jsc#20068)\n  * Adds sudo-feature-negated-LDAP-users.patch\n- Restrict use of sudo -U other -l to people who have permission\n  to run commands as that user (bsc#1181703, jsc#SLE-22569)\n  * feature-upstream-restrict-sudo-U-other-l.patch\n\nPackage supportutils was updated:\n\n- Spec file adjusted for usr-merge- Changes to version 3.1.20\n  + Added command blkid #114\n  + Added s390x specific files and output #115\n  + Fix for invalid argument during updates (bsc#1193204)\n  + Optimized conf_files, conf_files_text and log_cmd functions #118\n  + Fixed iscsi initiator name (bsc#1195797)\n  + Added rpcinfo -p output #116\n  + Included /etc/sssd/conf.d configuration files #100\n- Changes to version 3.1.19\n  + Made /proc directory and network names spaces configurable (bsc#1193868)\n- Changes to version 3.1.19\n  + Removed chronyc DNS lookups with -n switch (bsc#1193732)\n- Merged Include udev rules in /lib/udev/rules.d/ #113\n- Merged Move localmessage/warm logs out of messages.txt to new localwarn.txt #87\n- getappcore identifies compressed core files (bsc#1191794)\n- Installing to /usr/sbin instead of /sbin (bsc#1191096)\n- Added shared memory as a log directory for emergency use (bsc#1190943)\n- Fixed cron package for RPM validation (bsc#1190315)\n- Updated spec file with correct URL\n- Changes to version 3.1.18\n  + Added email.txt based on OPTION_EMAIL #108 (bsc#1189028)\n  + Include 'multipath -t' output in mpio.txt #105\n  + Improved lsblk readability with --ascsi #106\n  + Removed duplicate commands in network.txt\n  + Remove duplicate firewalld status output #109\n\nPackage supportutils-plugin-suse-public-cloud was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.0.6 (bsc#1195095, bsc#1195096)  + Include cloud-init logs whenever they are present\n  + Update the packages we track in AWS, Azure, and Google\n  + Include the ecs logs for AWS ECS instances\n\nPackage suse-build-key was updated:\n\n- still ship the old ptf key (was not added to documentation by mistake).

The\n  - doc subpackage already has the correct deps.\n- No longer recommend -lang: supplements are in use.\n- update to version 1.32\n  * Fix the use of --checkpoint without explicit --checkpoint-action\n  * Fix extraction with the -U option\n  * Fix iconv usage on BSD-based systems\n  * Fix possible NULL dereference (savannah bug #55369)\n    [bsc#1130496] [CVE-2019-9923]\n  * Improve the testsuite\n- remove tar-1.31-tests_dirrem.patch and\n  tar-1.31-racy_compress_tests.patch that are no longer needed\n  (applied usptream)\n- Remove libattr-devel from buildrequires, tar no longer uses\n  it but finds xattr functions in libc.\n- update to version 1.31\n  * Fix heap-buffer-overrun with --one-top-level, bug introduced\n    with the addition of that option in 1.28\n  * Support for zstd compression\n  * New option '--zstd' instructs tar to use zstd as compression\n    program. When listing, extractng and comparing, zstd compressed\n    archives are recognized automatically. When '-a' option is in\n    effect, zstd compression is selected if the destination archive\n    name ends in '.zst' or '.tzst'.\n  * The -K option interacts properly with member names given in the\n    command line. Names of members to extract can be specified along\n    with the \u0026quot;/-K NAME\u0026quot;/ option. In this case, tar will extract NAME\n    and those of named members that appear in the archive after it,\n    which is consistent with the semantics of the option. Previous\n    versions of tar extracted NAME, those of named members that\n    appeared before it, and everything after it.\n  * Fix CVE-2018-20482 - When creating archives with the --sparse\n    option, previous versions of tar would loop endlessly if a\n    sparse file had been truncated while being archived.\n- remove the following patches (upstreamed)\n  * tar-1.30-tests-difflink.patch\n

When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7.

If a Content-Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content differently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require that a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clients pulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or “manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update to version 1.0.1 of the spec.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-0778",
      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12.

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.",
