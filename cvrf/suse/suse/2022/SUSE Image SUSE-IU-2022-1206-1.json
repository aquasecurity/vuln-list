GCC12/CC_NO_ARRAY_BOUNDS\n  Upstream commit f0be87c42cbd (gcc-12: disable '-Warray-bounds'\n  universally for now) added two new compiler-dependent configs:\n  * CC_NO_ARRAY_BOUNDS\n  * GCC12_NO_ARRAY_BOUNDS\n  Ignore them -- they are unset by dummy tools (they depend on gcc version\n  == 12), but set as needed during real compilation.\n- commit a14607c\n- kernel-binary.spec: check s390x vmlinux location\n  As a side effect of mainline commit edd4a8667355 (\u0026quot;/s390/boot: get rid of\n  startup archive\u0026quot;/), vmlinux on s390x moved from \u0026quot;/compressed\u0026quot;/ subdirectory\n  directly into arch/s390/boot. As the specfile is shared among branches,\n  check both locations and let objcopy use one that exists.\n- commit cd15543\n- Add missing recommends of kernel-install-tools to kernel-source-vanilla (bsc#1200442)\n- commit 93b1375\n- kernel-binary.spec: Support radio selection for debuginfo.\n  To disable debuginfo on 5.18 kernel a radio selection needs to be\n  switched to a different selection. This requires disabling the currently\n  active option and selecting NONE as debuginfo type.\n- commit 43b5dd3\n- Add dtb-starfive\n- commit 85335b1\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: Also depend on dracut-systemd (bsc#1195775)\n- commit 5d4e32c\n- pahole 1.22 required for full BTF features.\n  also recommend pahole for kernel-source to make the kernel buildable\n  with standard config\n- commit 364f54b\n- use jobs not processors in the constraints\n  jobs is the number of vcpus available to the build, while processors\n  is the total processor count of the machine the VM is running on.\n- commit a6e141d\n- rpm/constraints.in: skip SLOW_DISK workers for kernel-source\n- commit e84694f\n- rpm/*.spec.in: remove backtick usage\n- commit 87ca1fb\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: add systemd-initrd and terminfo dracut module (bsc#1195775)\n- commit d9a821b\n- rpm/kernel-obs-build.spec.in: use default dracut modules (bsc#1195926,\n  bsc#1198484)\n  Let's iron out the reduced initrd optimisation in Tumbleweed.\n  Build full blown dracut initrd with systemd for SLE15 SP4.\n- commit ea76821\n- Add dtb-microchip\n- commit c797107\n- rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: temporary workaround for a build failure\n  Upstream c6x architecture removal left a dangling link behind which\n  triggers openSUSE post-build check in kernel-source, failing\n  kernel-source build.\n  A fix deleting the danglink link has been submitted but it did not make\n  it into 5.12-rc1. Unfortunately we cannot add it as a patch as patch\n  utility does not handle symlink removal. Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master. The reason is that this can happen any time again, so\n  let's have this in packaging instead.\n- commit 52a1ad7\n\nPackage libassuan was updated:\n\n- update to 2.5.5:  * Fix a crash in the logging code\n  * Upgrade autoconf\n- update to 2.5.4:\n  * Fix some minor build annoyances\n- Update to 2.5.3:\n  * Add a timeout for writing to a SOCKS5 proxy.\n  * Add workaround for a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH on newer systems.\n- qemu-disable-fdpassing-test.patch: remove\n-Update to 2.5.2:\n  * configure.ac: Bump LT version to C8/A8/R2\n  * include libassuan.pc in the spec file\n\nPackage libcroco was updated:\n\n- Add libcroco-CVE-2020-12825.patch: limit recursion in block and  any productions (boo#1171685 CVE-2020-12825).\n\nPackage libjpeg-turbo was updated:\n\n  fix CVE-2020-35538 [bsc#1202915], Null pointer dereference in jcopy_sample_rows() function  + libjpeg-turbo-CVE-2020-35538.patch\n- security update\n- added patches\n\nPackage libksba was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1204357, CVE-2022-3515]  * Detect a possible overflow directly in the TLV parser.\n  * Add libksba-CVE-2022-3515.patch\n\nPackage libtasn1 was updated:\n\n- Add libtasn1-CVE-2021-46848.patch: Fixed off-by-one array size check  that affects asn1_encode_simple_der (CVE-2021-46848, bsc#1204690).\n\nPackage libtirpc was updated:\n\n- fix CVE-2021-46828: libtirpc: DoS vulnerability with lots of  connections (bsc#1201680)\n  - backport 0001-Fix-DoS-vulnerability-in-libtirpc.patch\n- exclude ipv6 addresses in client protocol 2 code (bsc#1200800)\n  - update 0001-rpcb_clnt.c-config-to-try-protocolversion-2-first.patch\n- fix memory leak in params.r_addr assignement (bsc#1198752)\n  - add 0001-fix-parms.r_addr-memory-leak.patch\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- Security fixes:  * [CVE-2022-40303, bsc#1204366] Fix integer overflows with\n    XML_PARSE_HUGE\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40303.patch\n  * [CVE-2022-40304, bsc#1204367] Fix dict corruption caused by\n    entity reference cycles\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40304.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1201978, CVE-2016-3709]\n  * Cross-site scripting vulnerability after commit 960f0e2\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2016-3709.patch\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Resolver: Fix missing --[no]-recommends initialization in  update (fixes #openSUSE/zypper#459, bsc#1201972)\n- Log ONLY_NAMESPACE_RECOMMENDED because this is what corresponds\n  to --[no]-recommends.\n- version 17.31.2 (22)\n- UsrEtc: Store logrotate files in %{_distconfdir} if defined\n  (fixes #402)\n- Log backtrace on SIGABRT too.\n- Need to explicitly enable building experimental code.

This is\n    done as a way to demonstrate how to write table-valued\n    functions with required parameters.

This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",

In a typical installation, the telnetd application would crash but the telnet service would remain available through inetd. However, if the telnetd application has many crashes within a short time interval, the telnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs a \"telnet/tcp server failing (looping), service terminated\" error. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions. The affected code was removed from the supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) product many years ago, at version 1.8.",
