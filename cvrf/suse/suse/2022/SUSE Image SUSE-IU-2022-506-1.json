While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- x86/speculation: Warn about eIBRS + LFENCE + Unprivileged eBPF +\n  SMT (bsc#1114648).\n- commit 660df0a\n- Sort in upstreamed BHB patches\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/documentation-hw-vuln-update-spectre-doc.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-add-eibrs-retpoline-options.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-include-unprivileged-ebpf-status-in-spectre-v2-mitigation-reporting.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-rename-retpoline_amd-to-retpoline_lfence.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-use-generic-retpoline-by-default-on-amd.patch.\n- commit 9848ad0\n- net: bcmgenet: Fix a resource leak in an error handling path\n  in the probe functin (git-fixes).\n- commit 1def50c\n- gtp: fix an use-before-init in gtp_newlink() (git-fixes).\n- commit 2c87118\n- net: hdlc_raw_eth: Clear the IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING flag after\n  calling ether_setup (git-fixes).\n- commit c80c336\n- net: hdlc: In hdlc_rcv, check to make sure dev is an HDLC device\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit df21fd7\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 95d7e2c\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: fix packet alignment padding\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 065384f\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit f59903f\n- net: marvell: Fix OF_MDIO config check (git-fixes).\n- commit 1100da4\n- net: dp83867: Fix OF_MDIO config check (git-fixes).\n- commit 7fae20e\n- net: fec: only check queue 0 if RXF_0/TXF_0 interrupt is set\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 4b13398\n- blacklist.conf: update blacklist\n- commit 7d99dbc\n- Update patches.suse/sr9700-sanity-check-for-packet-length.patch\n  (bac#1196836 CVE-2022-26966).\n  added CVE number\n- commit 7e940d6\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS.

      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

      "Description": "Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations.
