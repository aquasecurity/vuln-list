encrypted challenge\n    code; (CVE-2021-36222);\n  * Fix a memory leak when gss_inquire_cred() is called without a\n    credential handle.\n- Changes from 1.19.1\n  * Fix a linking issue with Samba.\n  * Better support multiple pkinit_identities values by checking whether\n    certificates can be loaded for each value.\n- Changes from 1.19\n  Administrator experience\n  * When a client keytab is present, the GSSAPI krb5 mech will refresh\n    credentials even if the current credentials were acquired manually.\n  * It is now harder to accidentally delete the K/M entry from a KDB.\n  Developer experience\n  * gss_acquire_cred_from() now supports the \u0026quot;/password\u0026quot;/ and \u0026quot;/verify\u0026quot;/\n    options, allowing credentials to be acquired via password and\n    verified using a keytab key.\n  * When an application accepts a GSS security context, the new\n    GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG will be set if the initiator and acceptor\n    both provided matching channel bindings.\n  * Added the GSS_KRB5_NT_X509_CERT name type, allowing S4U2Self requests\n    to identify the desired client principal by certificate.\n  * PKINIT certauth modules can now cause the hw-authent flag to be set\n    in issued tickets.\n  * The krb5_init_creds_step() API will now issue the same password\n    expiration warnings as krb5_get_init_creds_password().\n  Protocol evolution\n  * Added client and KDC support for Microsoft's Resource-Based Constrained\n    Delegation, which allows cross-realm S4U2Proxy requests. A third-party\n    database module is required for KDC support.\n  * kadmin/admin is now the preferred server principal name for kadmin\n    connections, and the host-based form is no longer created by default.\n    The client will still try the host-based form as a fallback.\n  * Added client and server support for Microsoft's KERB_AP_OPTIONS_CBT\n    extension, which causes channel bindings to be required for the\n    initiator if the acceptor provided them. The client will send this\n    option if the client_aware_gss_bindings profile option is set.\n  User experience\n  * kinit will now issue a warning if the des3-cbc-sha1 encryption type is\n    used in the reply. This encryption type will be deprecated and removed\n    in future releases.\n  * Added kvno flags --out-cache, --no-store, and --cached-only\n    (inspired by Heimdal's kgetcred).\n- Changes from 1.18.3\n  * Fix a denial of service vulnerability when decoding Kerberos\n    protocol messages.\n  * Fix a locking issue with the LMDB KDB module which could cause\n    KDC and kadmind processes to lose access to the database.\n  * Fix an assertion failure when libgssapi_krb5 is repeatedly loaded\n    and unloaded while libkrb5support remains loaded.\n- Changes from 1.18.2\n  * Fix a SPNEGO regression where an acceptor using the default credential\n    would improperly filter mechanisms, causing a negotiation failure.\n  * Fix a bug where the KDC would fail to issue tickets if the local krbtgt\n    principal's first key has a single-DES enctype.\n  * Add stub functions to allow old versions of OpenSSL libcrypto to link\n    against libkrb5.\n  * Fix a NegoEx bug where the client name and delegated credential might\n    not be reported.\n- Changes from 1.18.1\n  * Fix a crash when qualifying short hostnames when the system has\n    no primary DNS domain.\n  * Fix a regression when an application imports \u0026quot;/service@\u0026quot;/ as a GSS\n    host-based name for its acceptor credential handle.\n  * Fix KDC enforcement of auth indicators when they are modified by\n    the KDB module.\n  * Fix removal of require_auth string attributes when the LDAP KDB\n    module is used.\n  * Fix a compile error when building with musl libc on Linux.\n  * Fix a compile error when building with gcc 4.x.\n  * Change the KDC constrained delegation precedence order for consistency\n    with Windows KDCs.\n- Changes from 1.18\n  Administrator experience:\n  * Remove support for single-DES encryption types.\n  * Change the replay cache format to be more efficient and robust.\n    Replay cache filenames using the new format end with \u0026quot;/.rcache2\u0026quot;/\n    by default.\n  * setuid programs will automatically ignore environment variables\n    that normally affect krb5 API functions, even if the caller does\n    not use krb5_init_secure_context().\n  * Add an \u0026quot;/enforce_ok_as_delegate\u0026quot;/ krb5.conf relation to disable\n    credential forwarding during GSSAPI authentication unless the KDC\n    sets the ok-as-delegate bit in the service ticket.\n  * Use the permitted_enctypes krb5.conf setting as the default value\n    for default_tkt_enctypes and default_tgs_enctypes.\n  Developer experience:\n  * Implement krb5_cc_remove_cred() for all credential cache types.\n  * Add the krb5_pac_get_client_info() API to get the client account\n    name from a PAC.\n  Protocol evolution:\n  * Add KDC support for S4U2Self requests where the user is identified\n    by X.509 certificate. (Requires support for certificate lookup from\n    a third-party KDB module.)\n  * Remove support for an old (\u0026quot;/draft 9\u0026quot;/) variant of PKINIT.\n  * Add support for Microsoft NegoEx. (Requires one or more third-party\n    GSS modules implementing NegoEx mechanisms.)\n  User experience:\n  * Add support for \u0026quot;/dns_canonicalize_hostname=fallback\u0026quot;/, causing\n    host-based principal names to be tried first without DNS\n    canonicalization, and again with DNS canonicalization if the\n    un-canonicalized server is not found.\n  * Expand single-component hostnames in host-based principal names\n    when DNS canonicalization is not used, adding the system's first DNS\n    search path as a suffix. Add a \u0026quot;/qualify_shortname\u0026quot;/ krb5.conf relation\n    to override this suffix or disable expansion.\n  * Honor the transited-policy-checked ticket flag on application servers,\n    eliminating the requirement to configure capaths on servers in some\n    scenarios.\n  Code quality:\n  * The libkrb5 serialization code (used to export and import krb5 GSS\n    security contexts) has been simplified and made type-safe.\n  * The libkrb5 code for creating KRB-PRIV, KRB-SAFE, and KRB-CRED\n    messages has been revised to conform to current coding practices.\n  * The test suite has been modified to work with macOS System Integrity\n    Protection enabled.\n  * The test suite incorporates soft-pkcs11 so that PKINIT PKCS11 support\n    can always be tested.\n- Changes from 1.17.1\n  * Fix a bug preventing \u0026quot;/addprinc -randkey -kvno\u0026quot;/ from working in kadmin.\n  * Fix a bug preventing time skew correction from working when a KCM\n    credential cache is used.\n- Changes from 1.17:\n  Administrator experience:\n  * A new Kerberos database module using the Lightning Memory-Mapped\n    Database library (LMDB) has been added.  The LMDB KDB module should\n    be more performant and more robust than the DB2 module, and may\n    become the default module for new databases in a future release.\n  * \u0026quot;/kdb5_util dump\u0026quot;/ will no longer dump policy entries when specific\n    principal names are requested.\n  Developer experience:\n  * The new krb5_get_etype_info() API can be used to retrieve enctype,\n    salt, and string-to-key parameters from the KDC for a client\n    principal.\n  * The new GSS_KRB5_NT_ENTERPRISE_NAME name type allows enterprise\n    principal names to be used with GSS-API functions.\n  * KDC and kadmind modules which call com_err() will now write to the\n    log file in a format more consistent with other log messages.\n  * Programs which use large numbers of memory credential caches should\n    perform better.\n  Protocol evolution:\n  * The SPAKE pre-authentication mechanism is now supported.  This\n    mechanism protects against password dictionary attacks without\n    requiring any additional infrastructure such as certificates.  SPAKE\n    is enabled by default on clients, but must be manually enabled on\n    the KDC for this release.\n  * PKINIT freshness tokens are now supported.  Freshness tokens can\n    protect against scenarios where an attacker uses temporary access to\n    a smart card to generate authentication requests for the future.\n  * Password change operations now prefer TCP over UDP, to avoid\n    spurious error messages about replays when a response packet is\n    dropped.\n  * The KDC now supports cross-realm S4U2Self requests when used with a\n    third-party KDB module such as Samba's.  The client code for\n    cross-realm S4U2Self requests is also now more robust.\n  User experience:\n  * The new ktutil addent -f flag can be used to fetch salt information\n    from the KDC for password-based keys.\n  * The new kdestroy -p option can be used to destroy a credential cache\n    within a collection by client principal name.\n  * The Kerberos man page has been restored, and documents the\n    environment variables that affect programs using the Kerberos\n    library.\n  Code quality:\n  * Python test scripts now use Python 3.\n  * Python test scripts now display markers in verbose output, making it\n    easier to find where a failure occurred within the scripts.\n  * The Windows build system has been simplified and updated to work\n    with more recent versions of Visual Studio.  A large volume of\n    unused Windows-specific code has been removed.  Visual Studio 2013\n    or later is now required.\n- Replace old $RPM_* shell vars\n- Removal of SuSEfirewall2 service since SuSEfirewall2 has been replaced\n  by firewalld\n- Remove cruft to support distributions older than SLE 12\n- Use macros where applicable\n- Switch to pkgconfig style dependencies\n- Use %_tmpfilesdir instead of the wrong %_libexecdir/tmpfiles.d\n  notation: libexecdir is likely changing away from /usr/lib to\n  /usr/libexec\n- Build with full Cyrus SASL support.

      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

For instance, a guest issuing a set/way cache maintenance instruction, then calling the XENMEM_decrease_reservation hypercall to give back memory pages to Xen, might be able to retain access to those pages even after Xen started reusing them for other purposes.",

This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.",
