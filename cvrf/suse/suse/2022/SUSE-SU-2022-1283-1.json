      "Text": "The SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2 kernel was updated to receive various security and bugfixes.\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2022-1016: Fixed a vulnerability in the nf_tables component of the netfilter subsystem. This vulnerability gives an attacker a powerful primitive that can be used to both read from and write to relative stack data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. (bsc#1197227)\n- CVE-2022-1048: Fixed a race Condition in snd_pcm_hw_free leading to use-after-free due to the AB/BA lock with buffer_mutex and mmap_lock. (bsc#1197331)\n- CVE-2022-0850: Fixed a kernel information leak vulnerability in iov_iter.c. (bsc#1196761)\n- CVE-2021-45868: Fixed a wrong validation check in fs/quota/quota_tree.c which could lead to an use-after-free if there is a corrupted quota file. (bnc#1197366)\n- CVE-2022-26966: Fixed an issue in drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c, which allowed attackers to obtain sensitive information from the memory via crafted frame lengths from a USB device. (bsc#1196836)\n- CVE-2022-23036,CVE-2022-23037,CVE-2022-23038,CVE-2022-23039,CVE-2022-23040,CVE-2022-23041,CVE-2022-23042: Fixed multiple issues which could have lead to read/write access to memory pages or denial of service. These issues are related to the Xen PV device frontend drivers. (bsc#1196488)\n- CVE-2022-26490: Fixed a buffer overflow in the st21nfca driver. An attacker with adjacent NFC access could crash the system or corrupt the system memory. (bsc#1196830)\n\nThe following non-security bugs were fixed:\n\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32 (bsc#1196018).\n- llc: fix netdevice reference leaks in llc_ui_bind() (git-fixes).\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup (bsc#1196018).\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: fix packet alignment padding (bsc#1196018).\n- sched/autogroup: Fix possible Spectre-v1 indexing for (git-fixes)\n- sr9700: sanity check for packet length (bsc#1196836).\n- usb: host: xen-hcd: add missing unlock in error path (git-fixes).\n- xen/usb: do not use gnttab_end_foreign_access() in xenhcd_gnttab_done() (bsc#1196488, XSA-396).\n",

      "Description": "Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042",
