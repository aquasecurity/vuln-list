      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-12-sp3-sap-v20220126 contains the following changes:\nPackage SUSEConnect was updated:\n\n- Update to 0.3.32- Allow --regcode and --instance-data attributes at the same time (jsc#PCT-164)\n- Document that 'debug' can also get set in the config file\n- --status will also print the subscription name\n- Update to 0.3.31\n- Disallow registering via SUSEConnect if the system is managed by SUSE Manager.\n- Add subscription name to output of 'SUSEConnect --status'\n- Update to 0.3.30\n- send payload of GET requests as part of the url,\n  not in the body (see bsc#1185611)\n\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- apparmor-profiles-add-sssd-to-nameservice.patch: Enable access  to sssd fast cache for nameservice users (bsc#1183599)\n- add-ld.so.preload-to-abstraction_base.patch: Add ld.so.preload to\n  abstraction/base (bsc#1181728)\n\nPackage at was updated:\n\n- Increase TasksMax limit from 512 (systemd default) to 4915,  fix bsc#1058557\n\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Add avahi-CVE-2021-3468.patch: avoid infinite loop by handling  HUP event in client_work (boo#1184521 CVE-2021-3468).\n  https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/pull/330\n- Update avahi-daemon-check-dns-suse.patch: needed rebase against\n  the updated avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh.\n\nPackage bash was updated:\n\n- Add patch bash-4.3-boo1192785.patch  * setuid causing permission denied on popen (bsc#1192785)\n- Add patch bsc1177369.patch to fix bsc#1177369\n  * tailf command does destroy terminal/console settings\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Fixed CVE-2021-25219:  The lame-ttl option controls how long named caches certain types\n  of broken responses from authoritative servers (see the security\n  advisory for details). This caching mechanism could be abused by\n  an attacker to significantly degrade resolver performance. The\n  vulnerability has been mitigated by changing the default value of\n  lame-ttl to 0 and overriding any explicitly set value with 0,\n  effectively disabling this mechanism altogether. ISC's testing has\n  determined that doing that has a negligible impact on resolver\n  performance while also preventing abuse.\n  Administrators may observe more traffic towards servers issuing\n  certain types of broken responses than in previous BIND 9 releases.\n  [bsc#1192146, CVE-2021-25219, bind-CVE-2021-25219.patch]\n- In BIND 9.0.0 -\u0026gt; 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -\u0026gt; 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -\u0026gt; 9.17.3, also\n  affects 9.9.3-S1 -\u0026gt; 9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview\n  Edition, An attacker on the network path for a TSIG-signed\n  request, or operating the server receiving the TSIG-signed request,\n  could send a truncated response to that request, triggering an\n  assertion failure, causing the server to exit. Alternately, an\n  off-path attacker would have to correctly guess when a TSIG-signed\n  request was sent, along with other characteristics of the packet\n  and message, and spoof a truncated response to trigger an assertion\n  failure, causing the server to exit.\n  [bsc#1188888, bind-CVE-2020-8622.patch, CVE-2020-8622]\n- When FIPS mode is enabled, the named tools will complain that\n  MD5 is enabled. This is now checked, MD5 is ignored and a\n  warning is shown.\n  [bsc#1181495, bind-bsc1181495-disable-md5-when-in-fips-mode.patch]\n- * A broken inbound incremental zone update (IXFR)\n    can cause named to terminate unexpectedly\n    [CVE-2021-25214, bind-CVE-2021-25214.patch]\n  * An assertion check can fail while answering queries\n    for DNAME records that require the DNAME to be processed to resolve\n    itself\n    [CVE-2021-25215, bind-CVE-2021-25215.patch]\n  * A second vulnerability in BIND's GSSAPI security\n    policy negotiation can be targeted by a buffer overflow attack\n    This is fixed by switching from ISC's implementation to the\n    use of gssapi.\n    [CVE-2021-25216, bind.spec]\n  [bsc#1185345]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff for compatibility on old  code stream that expect 'brcl 0,label' to not be disassembled\n  as 'jgnop label' on s390x.  [bsc#1192267]\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28523 aka boo#1188941.\n- Fix empty man-pages from broken release tarball [PR28144].\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch with contained a memory corruption\n  (boo#1191473).\n- Configure with --disable-x86-used-note on old code streams.\n- Disable libalternatives temporarily for build cycle reasons.\n- make TARGET-bfd=headers again, we patch bfd-in.h\n- This state submitted to SLE12 and SLE15 code streams for annual\n  toolchain update. [jsc#PM-2767, jsc#SLE-21561, jsc#SLE-19618]\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff to 66d5c7003, to include fixes for\n  PR28422, PR28192, PR28391.  Also adds some s390x arch14\n  instructions [jsc#SLE-18637].\n- Using libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.\n- Adjust for testsuite fails on older products that configure\n  binutils in different ways, adds  binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff\n  and adjusts binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff and\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff.\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28138.\n- Use LTO \u0026amp; PGO build.\n- Update to binutils 2.37:\n  * The GNU Binutils sources now requires a C99 compiler and library to\n    build.\n  * Support for the arm-symbianelf format has been removed.\n  * Support for Realm Management Extension (RME) for AArch64 has been\n    added.\n  * A new linker option '-z report-relative-reloc' for x86 ELF targets\n    has been added to report dynamic relative relocations.\n  * A new linker option '-z start-stop-gc' has been added to disable\n    special treatment of __start_*/__stop_* references when\n  - -gc-sections.\n  * A new linker options '-Bno-symbolic' has been added which will\n    cancel the '-Bsymbolic' and '-Bsymbolic-functions' options.\n  * The readelf tool has a new command line option which can be used to\n    specify how the numeric values of symbols are reported.\n  - -sym-base=0|8|10|16 tells readelf to display the values in base 8,\n    base 10 or base 16.  A sym base of 0 represents the default action\n    of displaying values under 10000 in base 10 and values above that in\n    base 16.\n  * A new format has been added to the nm program.  Specifying\n    '--format=just-symbols' (or just using -j) will tell the program to\n    only display symbol names and nothing else.\n  * A new command line option '--keep-section-symbols' has been added to\n    objcopy and strip.  This stops the removal of unused section symbols\n    when the file is copied.  Removing these symbols saves space, but\n    sometimes they are needed by other tools.\n  * The '--weaken', '--weaken-symbol' and '--weaken-symbols' options\n    supported by objcopy now make undefined symbols weak on targets that\n    support weak symbols.\n  * Readelf and objdump can now display and use the contents of .debug_sup\n    sections.\n  * Readelf and objdump will now follow links to separate debug info\n    files by default.  This behaviour can be stopped via the use of the\n    new '-wN' or '--debug-dump=no-follow-links' options for readelf and\n    the '-WN' or '--dwarf=no-follow-links' options for objdump.  Also\n    the old behaviour can be restored by the use of the\n    '--enable-follow-debug-links=no' configure time option.\n    The semantics of the =follow-links option have also been slightly\n    changed.  When enabled, the option allows for the loading of symbol\n    tables and string tables from the separate files which can be used\n    to enhance the information displayed when dumping other sections,\n    but it does not automatically imply that information from the\n    separate files should be displayed.\n    If other debug section display options are also enabled (eg\n    '--debug-dump=info') then the contents of matching sections in both\n    the main file and the separate debuginfo file *will* be displayed.\n    This is because in most cases the debug section will only be present\n    in one of the files.\n    If however non-debug section display options are enabled (eg\n    '--sections') then the contents of matching parts of the separate\n    debuginfo file will *not* be displayed.  This is because in most\n    cases the user probably only wanted to load the symbol information\n    from the separate debuginfo file.  In order to change this behaviour\n    a new command line option --process-links can be used.  This will\n    allow di0pslay options to applied to both the main file and any\n    separate debuginfo files.\n  * Nm has a new command line option: '--quiet'.  This suppresses \u0026quot;/no\n    symbols\u0026quot;/ diagnostic.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1181452 aka CVE-2021-20197 aka PR26945\n  bnc#1183511 aka CVE-2021-20284 aka PR26931\n  bnc#1184519 aka CVE-2021-20294 aka PR26929\n  bnc#1184620 aka CVE-2021-3487 aka PR26946\n  bnc#1184794 aka CVE-2020-35448 aka PR26574\n- Also fixes:\n  bsc#1183909 - slow performance of stripping some binaries\n- Rebased patches: binutils-build-as-needed.diff, binutils-fix-abierrormsg.diff,\n  binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff, binutils-fix-relax.diff,\n  binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff, binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Removed patches (are in upstream): ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch and\n  ppc-use-local-plt.patch.\n- Add binutils-2.37-branch.diff.gz.\n- ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch: PPC: ensure_undef_dynamic\n  on weak undef only in plt\n- ppc-use-local-plt.patch: PowerPC use_local_plt (prerequisite for above\n  patch)\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which fixes PR27587.\n- Do not run make TARGET-bfd=headers separately.\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff (includes fix for PR27441 aka bsc#1182252).\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff.\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which should fix PR27311 completely.\n  It fixes also PR27284.\n- Remove temporary fix 0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Add temporary upstream fix for PR27311\n  0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Update to binutils 2.36:\n  New features in the Assembler:\n    General:\n  * When setting the link order attribute of ELF sections, it is now\n    possible to use a numeric section index instead of symbol name.\n  * Added a .nop directive to generate a single no-op instruction in\n    a target neutral manner.  This instruction does have an effect on\n    DWARF line number generation, if that is active.\n  * Removed --reduce-memory-overheads and --hash-size as gas now\n    uses hash tables that can be expand and shrink automatically.\n    X86/x86_64:\n  * Add support for AVX VNNI, HRESET, UINTR, TDX, AMX and Key\n    Locker instructions.\n  * Support non-absolute segment values for lcall and ljmp.\n  * Add {disp16} pseudo prefix to x86 assembler.\n  * Configure with --enable-x86-used-note by default for Linux/x86.\n    ARM/AArch64:\n  * Add support for Cortex-A78, Cortex-A78AE and Cortex-X1,\n    Cortex-R82, Neoverse V1, and Neoverse N2 cores.\n  * Add support for ETMv4 (Embedded Trace Macrocell), ETE (Embedded\n    Trace Extension), TRBE (Trace Buffer Extension), CSRE (Call\n    Stack Recorder Extension) and BRBE (Branch Record Buffer\n    Extension) system registers.\n  * Add support for Armv8-R and Armv8.7-A ISA extensions.\n  * Add support for DSB memory nXS barrier, WFET and WFIT\n    instruction for Armv8.7.\n  * Add support for +csre feature for -march. Add CSR PDEC\n    instruction for CSRE feature in AArch64.\n  * Add support for +flagm feature for -march in Armv8.4 AArch64.\n  * Add support for +ls64 feature for -march in Armv8.7\n    AArch64. Add atomic 64-byte load/store instructions for this\n    feature.\n  * Add support for +pauth (Pointer Authentication) feature for\n  - march in AArch64.\n    New features in the Linker:\n  * Add --error-handling-script=\u0026lt;NAME\u0026gt; command line option to allow\n    a helper script to be invoked when an undefined symbol or a\n    missing library is encountered.  This option can be suppressed\n    via the configure time switch: --enable-error-handling-script=no.\n  * Add -z x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} to the x86 ELF linker to mark\n    x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} ISA level as needed.\n  * Add -z unique-symbol to avoid duplicated local symbol names.\n  * The creation of PE format DLLs now defaults to using a more\n    secure set of DLL characteristics.\n  * The linker now deduplicates the types in .ctf sections.  The new\n    command-line option --ctf-share-types describes how to do this:\n    its default value, share-unconflicted, produces the most compact\n    output.\n  * The linker now omits the \u0026quot;/variable section\u0026quot;/ from .ctf sections\n    by default, saving space.  This is almost certainly what you\n    want unless you are working on a project that has its own\n    analogue of symbol tables that are not reflected in the ELF\n    symtabs.\n  New features in other binary tools:\n  * The ar tool's previously unused l modifier is now used for\n    specifying dependencies of a static library. The arguments of\n    this option (or --record-libdeps long form option) will be\n    stored verbatim in the __.LIBDEP member of the archive, which\n    the linker may read at link time.\n  * Readelf can now display the contents of LTO symbol table\n    sections when asked to do so via the --lto-syms command line\n    option.\n  * Readelf now accepts the -C command line option to enable the\n    demangling of symbol names.  In addition the --demangle=\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;,\n  - -no-demangle, --recurse-limit and --no-recurse-limit options\n    are also now availale.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1179898 aka CVE-2020-16590 aka PR25821\n  bnc#1179899 aka CVE-2020-16591 aka PR25822\n  bnc#1179900 aka CVE-2020-16592 aka PR25823\n  bnc#1179901 aka CVE-2020-16593 aka PR25827\n  bnc#1179902 aka CVE-2020-16598 aka PR25840\n  bnc#1179903 aka CVE-2020-16599 aka PR25842\n  bnc#1180451 aka CVE-2020-35493 aka PR25307\n  bnc#1180454 aka CVE-2020-35496 aka PR25308\n  bnc#1180461 aka CVE-2020-35507 aka PR25308\n- Rebase the following patches:\n  * binutils-fix-relax.diff\n  * binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff\n  * binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Add missing dependency on bc (ld.gold testsuite uses it).\n- Use --enable-obsolete for cross builds as ia64 is deprecated now.\n- Add binutils-2.36-branch.diff.gz.\n- Add binutils-fix-relax.diff to fix linking relaxation problems\n  with old object files hitting some enterprise software. [bsc#1179341]\n- Update binutils-2.35-branch.diff.gz to commit 1c5243df:\n  * Fixes PR26520, aka [bsc#1179036], a problem in addr2line with\n    certain DWARF variable descriptions.\n  * Also fixes PR26711, PR26656, PR26655, PR26929, PR26808, PR25878,\n    PR26740, PR26778, PR26763, PR26685, PR26699, PR26902, PR26869,\n    PR26711\n  * The above includes fixes for dwo files produced by modern dwp,\n    fixing several problems in the DWARF reader.\n- Reapply spec file cleanup from format_spec_file\n- Remove a SLE10 version check\n- Update to 2.35.1 and rebased branch diff:\n  * This is a point release over the previous 2.35 version, containing bug\n  fixes, and as an exception to the usual rule, one new feature.  The\n  new feature is the support for a new directive in the assembler:\n  \u0026quot;/.nop\u0026quot;/.  This directive creates a single no-op instruction in whatever\n  encoding is correct for the target architecture.  Unlike the .space or\n  .fill this is a real instruction, and it does affect the generation of\n  DWARF line number tables, should they be enabled.\n- Update binutils-2.35-branch.diff.gz to commit 23f268a0:\n  * Add xBPF target\n  * Fix various problems with DWARF 5 support in gas\n- Toolchain module update for SLE15 [jsc#ECO-2373]\n- Includes changes that were SLE-only in binutils-add-z15-name.diff\n  for [bsc#1160590, jsc#SLE-7903 aka jsc#SLE-7464]\n- Amend binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff to adjust also new\n  testcases.\n- Add binutils-2.35-branch.diff.gz: it includes fix for\n  nm -B for objects compiled with -flto and -fcommon.\n- Add binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff to be compatible with old\n  output of nm relied on in scripts.\n- Add binutils-fix-abierrormsg.diff to work around an eager (new)\n  error message occuring without inputs and as-needed (affects\n  nvme-cli build).\n- Update to binutils 2.35:\n  * The asseembler can now produce DWARF-5 format line number tables.\n  * Readelf now has a \u0026quot;/lint\u0026quot;/ mode to enable extra checks of the files it is processing.\n  * Readelf will now display \u0026quot;/[...]\u0026quot;/ when it has to truncate a symbol name.\n    The old behaviour - of displaying as many characters as possible, up to\n    the 80 column limit - can be restored by the use of the --silent-truncation\n    option.\n  * The linker can now produce a dependency file listing the inputs that it\n    has processed, much like the -M -MP option supported by the compiler.\n- Regenerate add-ulp-section.diff with -p1 due to a fuzzing issue.\n- Remove binutils-2.34-branch.diff.gz.\n- Regenerate binutils-build-as-needed.diff due to a fuzzing issue.\n- Regenerate binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff as one hunk was upstreamed.\n- Remove upstreamed patch binutils-pr25593.diff.\n- Regenerate unit-at-a-time.patch due to a fuzzing issue.\n- Regenerate binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff.\n- Update binutils-2.34-branch.diff.gz.\n- Remove fix-try_load_plugin.patch as it is part\n  of the updated binutils-2.34-branch.diff.gz patch.\n- Add binutils-pr25593.diff to fix DT_NEEDED order with -flto\n  [bsc#1163744]\n- Update fix-try_load_plugin.patch to latest version.\n- Add fix-try_load_plugin.patch in order to fix fallback caused\n  by backport for PR25355.\n- Update to binutils 2.34:\n  * The disassembler (objdump --disassemble) now has an option to\n    generate ascii art thats show the arcs between that start and end\n    points of control flow instructions.\n  * The binutils tools now have support for debuginfod.  Debuginfod is a\n    HTTP service for distributing ELF/DWARF debugging information as\n    well as source code.  The tools can now connect to debuginfod\n    servers in order to download debug information about the files that\n    they are processing.\n  * The assembler and linker now support the generation of ELF format\n    files for the Z80 architecture.\n- Rename and get binutils-2.34-branch.diff.gz (boo#1160254).\n- Rebase add-ulp-section.diff, binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff,\n  cross-avr-size.patch and binutils-skip-rpaths.patch.\n- Add new subpackages for libctf and libctf-nobfd.\n- Disable LTO due to boo#1163333.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1153768 aka CVE-2019-17451 aka PR25070\n  bnc#1153770 aka CVE-2019-17450 aka PR25078\n- Disable LTO during testsuite run\n- Add binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff to fix various\n  build fails on aarch64 (PR25210, bsc#1157755).\n- Add add-ulp-section.diff for user space live patching.\n- Update to binutils 2.33.1:\n  * Adds support for the Arm Scalable Vector Extension version 2\n    (SVE2) instructions, the Arm Transactional Memory Extension (TME)\n    instructions and the Armv8.1-M Mainline and M-profile Vector\n    Extension (MVE) instructions.\n  * Adds support for the Arm Cortex-A76AE, Cortex-A77 and Cortex-M35P\n    processors and the AArch64 Cortex-A34, Cortex-A65, Cortex-A65AE,\n    Cortex-A76AE, and Cortex-A77 processors.\n  * Adds a .float16 directive for both Arm and AArch64 to allow\n    encoding of 16-bit floating point literals.\n  * For MIPS, Add -m[no-]fix-loongson3-llsc option to fix (or not)\n    Loongson3 LLSC Errata.  Add a --enable-mips-fix-loongson3-llsc=[yes|no]\n    configure time option to set the default behavior. Set the default\n    if the configure option is not used to \u0026quot;/no\u0026quot;/.\n  * The Cortex-A53 Erratum 843419 workaround now supports a choice of\n    which workaround to use.  The option --fix-cortex-a53-843419 now\n    takes an optional argument --fix-cortex-a53-843419[=full|adr|adrp]\n    which can be used to force a particular workaround to be used.\n    See --help for AArch64 for more details.\n  * Add support for GNU_PROPERTY_AARCH64_FEATURE_1_BTI and\n    GNU_PROPERTY_AARCH64_FEATURE_1_PAC  in ELF GNU program properties\n    in the AArch64 ELF linker.\n  * Add -z force-bti for AArch64 to enable GNU_PROPERTY_AARCH64_FEATURE_1_BTI\n    on output while warning about missing GNU_PROPERTY_AARCH64_FEATURE_1_BTI\n    on inputs and use PLTs protected with BTI.\n  * Add -z pac-plt for AArch64 to pick PAC enabled PLTs.\n  * Add --source-comment[=\u0026lt;txt\u0026gt;] option to objdump which if present,\n    provides a prefix to source code lines displayed in a disassembly.\n  * Add --set-section-alignment \u0026lt;section-name\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;power-of-2-align\u0026gt;\n    option to objcopy to allow the changing of section alignments.\n  * Add --verilog-data-width option to objcopy for verilog targets to\n    control width of data elements in verilog hex format.\n  * The separate debug info file options of readelf (--debug-dump=links\n    and --debug-dump=follow) and objdump (--dwarf=links and\n  - -dwarf=follow-links) will now display and/or follow multiple\n    links if more than one are present in a file.  (This usually\n    happens when gcc's -gsplit-dwarf option is used).\n    In addition objdump's --dwarf=follow-links now also affects its\n    other display options, so that for example, when combined with\n  - -syms it will cause the symbol tables in any linked debug info\n    files to also be displayed.  In addition when combined with\n  - -disassemble the --dwarf= follow-links option will ensure that\n    any symbol tables in the linked files are read and used when\n    disassembling code in the main file.\n  * Add support for dumping types encoded in the Compact Type Format\n    to objdump and readelf.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1126826 aka CVE-2019-9077 aka PR1126826\n  bnc#1126829 aka CVE-2019-9075 aka PR1126829\n  bnc#1126831 aka CVE-2019-9074 aka PR24235\n  bnc#1140126 aka CVE-2019-12972 aka PR23405\n  bnc#1143609 aka CVE-2019-14444 aka PR24829\n  bnc#1142649 aka CVE-2019-14250 aka PR90924\n- Remove patches that are now included in the release:\n  binutils-2.32-branch.diff.gz, binutils-fix-ld-segv.diff,\n  binutils-pr24486.patch, riscv-abi-check.patch,\n  rx-gas-padding-pr24464.patch.\n- Add binutils-2.33-branch.diff.gz patch.\n- Rebase binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff and\n  cross-avr-size.patch patch.\n\nPackage bzip2 was updated:\n\n- Implement %check, bsc#1191648- Remove bzip2-faster.patch, it causes a crash with libarchive and\n  valgrind points out uninitialized memory.

Demonstrated by test patterns\n  such as /(?(1)^())b/ or /(?(?=^))b/.\n  * Fix subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is disabled and X or R has\n  a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue was found by Yunho Kim.\n  (bsc#1172973 CVE-2019-20838)\n  * If a pattern started with a subroutine call that had a quantifier with a\n  minimum of zero, an incorrect \u0026quot;/match must start with this character\u0026quot;/ could be\n  recorded. Example: /(?\u0026amp;xxx)*ABC(?\u0026lt;xxx\u0026gt;XYZ)/ would (incorrectly) expect 'A' to\n  be the first character of a match.\n- pcre 8.42\n  * If a backreference with a minimum repeat count of zero was first in a\n  pattern, apart from assertions, an incorrect first matching character could be\n  recorded. For example, for the pattern /(?=(a))1?b/, \u0026quot;/b\u0026quot;/ was incorrectly set\n  as the first character of a match.\n  * Fix out-of-bounds read for partial matching of /./ against an empty string\n  when the newline type is CRLF.\n  * When matching using the the REG_STARTEND feature of the POSIX API with a\n  non-zero starting offset, unset capturing groups with lower numbers than a\n  group that did capture something were not being correctly returned as \u0026quot;/unset\u0026quot;/\n  (that is, with offset values of -1).\n  * Matching the pattern /(*UTF)C[^v]+x80/ against an 8-bit string\n  containing multi-code-unit characters caused bad behaviour and possibly a\n  crash. This issue was fixed for other kinds of repeat in release 8.37 by change\n  38, but repeating character classes were overlooked.\n- pcre 8.41\n  * Fix a missing else in the JIT compiler (bsc#1025709 CVE-2017-6004)\n  * A (?# style comment is now ignored between a basic quantifier and a\n    following '+' or '?' (example: /X+(?#comment)?Y/.\n  * Avoid use of a potentially overflowing buffer in pcregrep (patch by Petr\n    Pisar).\n  * In the 32-bit library in non-UTF mode, an attempt to find a Unicode\n  property for a character with a code point greater than 0x10ffff (the Unicode\n  maximum) caused a crash. (bsc#1030807 CVE-2017-7244)\n  * The alternative matching function, pcre_dfa_exec() misbehaved if it\n  encountered a character class with a possessive repeat, for example [a-f]{3}+.\n  (bsc#1030066 CVE-2017-7186)\n  * When pcretest called pcre_copy_substring() in 32-bit mode, it set the buffer\n  length incorrectly, which could result in buffer overflow.\n  (bsc#1030805 CVE-2017-7245, bsc#1030803 CVE-2017-7246)\n  * Fix returned offsets from regexec() when REG_STARTEND is used with a\n  starting offset greater than zero.\n- pcre 8.40\n  * Fix register overwite in JIT when SSE2 acceleration is enabled.\n  * Ignore \u0026quot;/show all captures\u0026quot;/ (/=) for DFA matching.\n  * Fix JIT unaligned accesses on x86. Patch by Marc Mutz.\n  * In any wide-character mode (8-bit UTF or any 16-bit or 32-bit mode),\n    without PCRE_UCP set, a negative character type such as D in a positive\n    class should cause all characters greater than 255 to match, whatever else\n    is in the class. There was a bug that caused this not to happen if a\n    Unicode property item was added to such a class, for example [DP{Nd}] or\n    [WpL].\n  * A pattern such as (?\u0026lt;RA\u0026gt;abc)(?(R)xyz) was incorrectly compiled such that\n    the conditional was interpreted as a reference to capturing group 1 instead\n    of a test for recursion. Any group whose name began with R was\n    misinterpreted in this way. (The reference interpretation should only\n    happen if the group's name is precisely \u0026quot;/R\u0026quot;/.)\n  * A number of bugs have been mended relating to match start-up optimizations\n    when the first thing in a pattern is a positive lookahead. These all\n    applied only when PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE was *not* set:\n    (a) A pattern such as (?=.*X)X$ was incorrectly optimized as if it needed\n    both an initial 'X' and a following 'X'.\n    (b) Some patterns starting with an assertion that started with .* were\n    incorrectly optimized as having to match at the start of the subject or\n    after a newline. There are cases where this is not true, for example,\n    (?=.*[A-Z])(?=.{8,16})(?!.*[s]) matches after the start in lines that\n    start with spaces. Starting .* in an assertion is no longer taken as an\n    indication of matching at the start (or after a newline).\n\nPackage polkit was updated:\n\n- CVE-2021-4034: fixed a local privilege escalation in pkexec (bsc#1194568)  added CVE-2021-4034-pkexec-fix.patch\n- CVE-2021-3560: fixed a local privilege escalation using polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync()\n  (bsc#1186497)\n  CVE-2021-3560.patch\n\nPackage psmisc was updated:\n\n- Change patch 0001-Use-mountinfo-to-be-able-to-use-the-mount-identity.patch  * Fix bsc#1185208 to make private mount namespaces work as well\n    as to distinguish NFS mounts from same remote device share.\n- Remove patch bsc1185208.patch as now solved in main patch/commit\n- Fix for SG#60627, bsc#1185208:\n  * bsc1185208.patch: Don't list all processes from different private\n    namespace when fuser is run on a NFS mount.\n- Change patch 0001-Use-mountinfo-to-be-able-to-use-the-mount-identity.patch\n  * Fix bsc#1178407: fuser does not show open kvm storage image files\n    such as qcow2 files.

Also fixed Issue #345.\n  * More hacks on Windows for running CFFIâs own setup.py.\n  * Issue #358: in embedding, to protect against (the rare case of)\n    Python initialization from several threads in parallel, we have to\n    use a spin-lock. On CPython 3 it is worse because it might\n    spin-lock for a long time (execution of Py_InitializeEx()). Sadly,\n    recent changes to CPython make that solution needed on CPython 2\n    too.\n  * CPython 3 on Windows: we no longer compile with Py_LIMITED_API by\n    default because such modules cannot be used with virtualenv. Issue\n    [#350] mentions a workaround if you still want that and are not\n    concerned about virtualenv: pass a\n    define_macros=[(\u0026quot;/Py_LIMITED_API\u0026quot;/, None)] to the\n    ffibuilder.set_source() call.\n- specfile:\n  * delete patch cffi-loader.patch; included upstream\n- update to version 1.11.4:\n  * Windows: reverted linking with python3.dll, because virtualenv\n    does not make this DLL available to virtual environments for\n    now. See Issue #355. On Windows only, the C extension modules\n    created by cffi follow for now the standard naming scheme\n    foo.cp36-win32.pyd, to make it clear that they are regular CPython\n    modules depending on python36.dll.\n- changes from version 1.11.3:\n  * Fix on CPython 3.x: reading the attributes __loader__ or __spec__\n    from the cffi-generated lib modules gave a buggy\n    SystemError. (These attributes are always None, and provided only\n    to help compatibility with tools that expect them in all modules.)\n  * More Windows fixes: workaround for MSVC not supporting large\n    literal strings in C code (from\n    ffi.embedding_init_code(large_string)); and an issue with\n    Py_LIMITED_API linking with python35.dll/python36.dll instead of\n    python3.dll.\n  * Small documentation improvements.\n\nPackage python-cryptography was updated:\n\n- Update in SLE-12 (bsc#1176784, jsc#ECO-3105, jsc#PM-2352)- update to 2.8\n  * Added support for Python 3.8.\n  * Added class methods Poly1305.generate_tag and Poly1305.verify_tag for Poly1305 sign and verify operations.\n  * Deprecated support for OpenSSL 1.0.1.

Use serial_number instead.\n  * Updated Windows, macOS, and manylinux1 wheels to be compiled with\n    OpenSSL 1.1.1b.\n  * Added support for Ed448 signing when using OpenSSL 1.1.1b or newer.\n  * Added support for Ed25519 signing when using OpenSSL 1.1.1b or newer.\n  * load_ssh_public_key() can now load ed25519 public keys.\n  * Add support for easily mapping an object identifier to its elliptic curve\n    class viaget_curve_for_oid().\n  * Add support for OpenSSL when compiled with the no-engine\n    (OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE) flag.\n- Dependency on python-idna changed to \u0026quot;/Recommends\u0026quot;/ aligned with\n  change in upstream source (see below)\n- update to 2.5:\n  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: U-label strings were deprecated in version 2.1,\n    but this version removes the default idna dependency as well. If you still\n    need this deprecated path please install cryptography with the idna extra:\n    pip install cryptography[idna].\n  * BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: The minimum supported PyPy version is now 5.4.\n  * Numerous classes and functions have been updated to allow bytes-like\n    types for keying material and passwords, including symmetric algorithms,\n    AEAD ciphers, KDFs, loading asymmetric keys, and one time password classes.\n  * Updated Windows, macOS, and manylinux1 wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.1a.\n  * Added support for SHA512_224 and SHA512_256 when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n  * Added support for SHA3_224, SHA3_256, SHA3_384, and SHA3_512 when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n  * Added support for X448 key exchange when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n  * Added support for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n  * Added initial support for parsing PKCS12 files with load_key_and_certificates().\n  * Added support for IssuingDistributionPoint.\n  * Added rfc4514_string() method to x509.Name,\n    x509.RelativeDistinguishedName, and x509.NameAttribute to format the name\n    or component an RFC 4514 Distinguished Name string.\n  * Added from_encoded_point(), which immediately checks if the point is on\n    the curve and supports compressed points. Deprecated the previous method\n    from_encoded_point().\n  * Added signature_hash_algorithm to OCSPResponse.\n  * Updated X25519 key exchange support to allow additional serialization\n    methods. Calling public_bytes() with no arguments has been deprecated.\n  * Added support for encoding compressed and uncompressed points via\n    public_bytes(). Deprecated the previous method encode_point().\n- Update to version 2.4.2:\n  * Updated Windows, macOS, and manylinux1 wheels to be compiled\n    with OpenSSL 1.1.0j.\n- Update to 2.4.1:\n  * Dropped support for LibreSSL 2.4.x.\n  * Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.1 support. OpenSSL 1.0.1 is no\n    longer supported by the OpenSSL project. At this time there\n    is no time table for dropping support, however we strongly\n    encourage all users to upgrade or install cryptography from\n    a wheel.\n  * Added initial :doc:`OCSP \u0026lt;/x509/ocsp\u0026gt;` support.\n  * Added support for cryptography.x509.PrecertPoison.\n- Fix fdupes call\n- Update to 2.3.1:\n  * updated tests for upstream wycheproof changes\n  * many other tiny test tweaks\n- update to 2.3:\n  * SECURITY ISSUE: finalize_with_tag() allowed tag truncation by default\n    which can allow tag forgery in some cases.

When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.",

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.",

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.",

Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery.

That is, when operating in this mode, a guest has two tables. As a result, guests also need to be able to retrieve the addresses that the new status tracking table can be accessed through. For 32-bit guests on x86, translation of requests has to occur because the interface structure layouts commonly differ between 32- and 64-bit. The translation of the request to obtain the frame numbers of the grant status table involves translating the resulting array of frame numbers. Since the space used to carry out the translation is limited, the translation layer tells the core function the capacity of the array within translation space. Unfortunately the core function then only enforces array bounds to be below 8 times the specified value, and would write past the available space if enough frame numbers needed storing.",

      "Description": "ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).",
