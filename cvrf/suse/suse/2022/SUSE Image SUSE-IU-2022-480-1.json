It is not available  on SLED or PackageHub, and it is only needed by avahi-bookmarks\n  (bsc#1196282).\n- Add avahi-bookmarks-import-warning.patch: fix warning when\n  twisted is not available.\n- Replace avahi-0.6.31-systemd-order.patch with\n  avahi-add-resolv-conf-to-inotify.patch: re-read configuration\n  when resolv.conf changes, per discussion on the bug\n  (boo#1194561).\n- Have python3-avahi require python3-dbus-python, not the\n  python 2 dbus-1-python package (bsc#1195614).\n- Reinstate avahi-0.6.31-systemd-order.patch (boo#1194561).\n  This can probably go away if/when gh#lathiat/avahi#118 is fixed.\n- Drop avahi-0.6.32-suppress-resolv-conf-warning.patch: we should\n  no longer need this given the above patch.\n- Move sftp-ssh and ssh services to the doc directory. They allow\n  a host's up/down status to be easily discovered and should not\n  be enabled by default (boo#1179060).\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- When using forwarders, bogus NS records supplied by, or via, those  forwarders may be cached and used by named if it needs to recurse\n  for any reason, causing it to obtain and pass on potentially\n  incorrect answers.\n  [CVE-2021-25220, bsc#1197135, bind-9.16.27-0001-CVE-2021-25220.patch]\n\nPackage chrony was updated:\n\n- Fix config file handling in the spec file and remove \u0026quot;/ntsdumpdir\u0026quot;/  from default config, because augeas-lenses cannot parse it during\n  installation of SLE Micro on SLE-15-SP3 (bsc#1194220).\n- bsc#1194229: Fix pool package dependencies, so that SLE actually\n  prefers chrony-pool-suse over chrony-pool-empty.\n- Add chrony-htonl.patch to work around undocumented behaviour of\n  htonl() in older glibc versions (SLE-12) on 64 bit big endian\n  architectures (s390x).\n- SLE bugs that have been fixed in openSUSE up to this point\n  without explicit references: bsc#1183783, bsc#1184400,\n  bsc#1171806, bsc#1161119, bsc#1159840.\n- Obsoleted SLE patches:\n  * chrony-fix-open.patch\n  * chrony-gettimeofday.patch\n  * chrony-ntp-era-split.patch\n  * chrony-pidfile.patch\n  * chrony-select-timeout.patch\n  * chrony-urandom.patch\n  * chrony.sysconfig\n  * clknetsim-glibc-2.31.patch\n- boo#1190926: PrivateDevices is too strict, we might need to\n  access the rtc and ptp devices.\n- Add back support to build chrony on SLE12.\n- Drop dependency on asciidoctor. It is only needed for building\n  the HTML documentation which we don't package anyway.\n- Added hardening to systemd service(s). Added patch(es):\n  * harden_chrony-wait.service.patch\n  * harden_chronyd.service.patch\n- boo#1187906: Consolidate all references to the helper script.\n- Add now working CONFIG parameter to sysusers generator\n- Change to using systemd-sysusers\n- Remove otherproviders, not needed anymore\n- Update to 4.1\n  * Add support for NTS servers specified by IP address (matching\n    Subject Alternative Name in server certificate)\n  * Add source-specific configuration of trusted certificates\n  * Allow multiple files and directories with trusted certificates\n  * Allow multiple pairs of server keys and certificates\n  * Add copy option to server/pool directive\n  * Increase PPS lock limit to 40% of pulse interval\n  * Perform source selection immediately after loading dump files\n  * Reload dump files for addresses negotiated by NTS-KE server\n  * Update seccomp filter and add less restrictive level\n  * Restart ongoing name resolution on online command\n  * Fix dump files to not include uncorrected offset\n  * Fix initstepslew to accept time from own NTP clients\n  * Reset NTP address and port when no longer negotiated by NTS-KE\n    server\n- Update clknetsim to snapshot f89702d.\n- Refresh chrony.keyring from\n  https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/gpgkey-8F375C7E8D0EE125A3D3BD51537E2B76F7680DAC.asc\n- Ensure the correct pool packages are installed for openSUSE\n  and SLE (bsc#1180689).\n- Enable syscallfilter unconditionally [boo#1181826].\n- drop buildrequires on NSS. We need gnutls for NTS anyway and we\n  can do all the other required crypto via nettle+gnutls. no need\n  for another crypto library.\n- Update to 4.0\n  - Enhancements\n  - Add support for Network Time Security (NTS) authentication\n  - Add support for AES-CMAC keys (AES128, AES256) with Nettle\n  - Add authselectmode directive to control selection of\n    unauthenticated sources\n  - Add

faster update with -q/-Q\n    option\n  - Avoid replacing NTP sources with sources that have\n    unreachable address\n  - Improve pools to repeat name resolution to get \u0026quot;/maxsources\u0026quot;/\n    sources\n  - Improve source selection with trusted sources\n  - Improve NTP loop test to prevent synchronisation to itself\n  - Repeat iburst when NTP source is switched from offline state\n    to online\n  - Update clock synchronisation status and leap status more\n    frequently\n  - Update seccomp filter\n  - Add \u0026quot;/add pool\u0026quot;/ command\n  - Add \u0026quot;/reset sources\u0026quot;/ command to drop all measurements\n  - Add authdata command to print details about NTP\n    authentication\n  - Add selectdata command to print details about source\n    selection\n  - Add -N option and sourcename command to print original names\n    of sources\n  - Add -a option to some commands to print also unresolved\n    sources\n  - Add -k, -p, -r options to clients command to select, limit,\n    reset data\n  - Bug fixes\n  - Donât set interface for NTP responses to allow asymmetric\n    routing\n  - Handle RTCs that donât support interrupts\n  - Respond to command requests with correct address on\n    multihomed hosts\n  - Removed features\n  - Drop support for RIPEMD keys (RMD128, RMD160, RMD256, RMD320)\n  - Drop support for long (non-standard) MACs in NTPv4 packets\n    (chrony 2.x clients using non-MD5/SHA1 keys need to use\n    option \u0026quot;/version 3\u0026quot;/)\n  - Drop support for line editing with GNU Readline\n- add BuildRequires for gnutls-devel (which also pulls nettle to\n  enable the new features)\n- drop patches which are included in the update:\n  chrony-test-update-processing-of-packet-log.patch\n  chrony-test-fix-util-unit-test-for-NTP-era-split.patch\n- refreshed chrony-config.patch\n- track series file for easier quilt setup\n- added option to turn off testsuite with\n  osc build --without=testsuite\n  testsuite still runs by default\n- By default we don't write log files but log to journald, so\n  only recommend logrotate.\n- Adjust and rename the sysconfig file, so that it matches the\n  expectations of chronyd.service (bsc#1173277).\n- Update to 3.5.1:\n  * Create new file when writing pidfile (CVE-2020-14367, bsc#1174911)\n- Fixes for %_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec (bsc#1174075)\n- Use iburst in the default pool statements to speed up initial\n  synchronisation (bsc#1172113).\n- Use _systemdutildir instead of _libexecdir/systemd: systemd does\n  not actually live below libexecdir.\n- Add chrony-test-update-processing-of-packet-log.patch in order\n  to fix test-suite failure.\n- Update clknetsim to version 79ffe44 (fixes boo#1162964).\n- Backport chrony-test-fix-util-unit-test-for-NTP-era-split.patch.\n- Change to BuildRequires: rubygem(asciidoctor) and remove conditional\n  (is available in SLE12-SP4

      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",
