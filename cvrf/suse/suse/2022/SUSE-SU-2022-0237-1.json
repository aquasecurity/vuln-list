(bsc#1193575)\n- CVE-2020-3702: Fixed a bug which could be triggered with specifically timed and handcrafted traffic and cause internal errors in a WLAN device that lead to improper layer 2 Wi-Fi encryption with a consequent possibility of information disclosure. (bsc#1191193)\n- CVE-2021-42739: The firewire subsystem had a buffer overflow related to drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt mishandled bounds checking (bsc#1184673).\n",
