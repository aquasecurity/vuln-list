      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp3-sap-v20221108-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage HANA-Firewall was updated:\n\n- Adaption to new go compiler behavior regarding test and build  (bsc#1197697)\n\nPackage Mesa was updated:\n\n- previous change didn't have any effect; default driver for Intel  Gen8-11 hardware was already \u0026quot;/i965\u0026quot;/ since Mesa 20.x still checked\n  for option 'prefer-iris' and gallium iris driver build to make it\n  default - which is only true in Mesa-drivers, but not in Mesa\n  build; let's just remove this confusing \u0026quot;/-Dprefer-iris=false\u0026quot;/\n  option (boo#1202850, comment#29)\n- change default driver from 'iris' back to 'i965' for Intel\n  Gen8-11 hardware; that way we also use the same driver used by X\n  and Mesa (boo#1200965); related bugs: boo#1197045, boo#1197046\n\nPackage NetworkManager was updated:\n\n- Add 0001-supplicant-interface-Match-more-ciphers-to-determine.patch:  supplicant/interface: Match more ciphers todetermine AP security\n  (glfo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager/commit/e0191320, bsc#1198381);\n- Add 0001-rdisc-fix-parsing-ndp_msg_opt_dnssl_lifetime-from-IP.patch:\n  rdisc: fix parsing ndp_msg_opt_dnssl_lifetime() from IPv6 RA\n  (bsc#1195222).\n- Add 0001-ndisc-don-t-artificially-extend-the-lifetime-of-DNSS.patch:\n  ndisc: don't artificially extend the lifetime of DNSSL/RDNSS\n  options (bsc#1195222).\n- Add NetworkManager-RFC8106.patch: Backport upstream fixes to\n  implement RFC 8106(glfo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager#874,\n  bsc#1195173).\n\nPackage SAPHanaSR was updated:\n\n- SAPHanaSR-monitor not reporting correctly  (bsc#1192963)\n  add patch:\n    0001-bsc-1192963.patch\n- Version bump to 0.161.1_BF\n- add the required 'xmllint' to the package\n  (bsc#1201945)\n- changes to the demote_clone function of the resource agent:\n  if the role is '1:P' (topology agent run into timeouts) the\n  function fail with rc=1, to get the managed resource stopped\n  changes to the stop_clone function of the topology agent:\n  call landscapeHostConfiguration.py and set the roles as they were\n  reported. If the command timed out, set the role to '1:P' and\n  return 1 to get the node fenced.\n  The used timeout for the landscapeHostConfiguration.py call can\n  be configured by the cluster action timeout, if needed. It will\n  be 50% of the action timeout or the minimum of 300s.\n  (bsc#1198127)\n- add new HA/DR provider hook susChkSrv\n  (jsc#PED-1241, jsc#PED-1240)\n- add new tool SAPHanaSR-manageProvider to show, add and delete\n  HA/DR provider sections in the global.ini of SAP HANA.\n- update suse icon to new branding\n- Version bump to 0.160.1\n- fix HANA_CALL function to support MCOS environments again\n  (bsc#1198780)\n- fix SAPHanaSR-replay-archive to handle hb_report archives again\n  (bsc#1198897)\n- add HANA_CALL_TIMEOUT parameter back to the resource agents and\n  read the setting from the cluster configuration, if available.\n  Defaults to '60'.\n  Related to github issue#36\n- add new HA/DR provider hook susTkOver\n  (jsc#SLE-16347)\n- add new hook script for SAP HANA System Replication Scale-Up Cost\n  Optimized Scenario.\n  (jsc#SLE-18613)\n- add a new instance parameter 'REMOVE_SAP_SOCKETS'.\n  It is an optional parameter and defaults to 'true'. Now you can\n  control, if the RA should remove the unix domain sockets related\n  to sapstartsrv before (re-)start sapstartsrv or if it should try\n  to adjust the permissions and ownership of these files instead.\n- Version bump to 0.155.0\n- Add systemd support for the resource agent to interact with the\n  new SAP unit files for sapstartsrv.\n  As the new version of the SAP Startup Framework will use systemd\n  unit files to control the sapstartsrv process instead of the\n  previous used SysV init script, we need to adapt the handling of\n  sapstartsrv inside the resource agents to support both ways.\n  (bsc#1189530, bsc#1189531)\n- The resource start and stop timeout is now configurable by\n  increasing the timeout for the action 'start' and/or 'stop'.\n  We will use 95% of this action timeouts to calculate the new\n  resource start and stop timeout for the 'WaitforStarted' and\n  'WaitforStopped' functions. If the new, calculated timeout value\n  is less than '3600', it will be set to '3600', so that we do not\n  decrease this timeout by accident\n  (bsc#1182545)\n- change promotion scoring during maintenance procedure to prevent\n  that both sides have an equal promotion scoring after refresh\n  which might result in a critical promotion of the secondary.\n  (bsc#1174557)\n- update of man page SAPHanaSR.py.7 - correct the supported HANA\n  version.\n  (bsc#1182201)\n- if the $hdbState command fails to retrieve the current state of\n  the System Replication, the resource agent now uses the\n  system_replication/actual_mode attribute (if available) from the\n  global.ini file as a fallback.\n  This should prevent some confusing and misleading log messages\n  during a takeover and solves the problem of a not working\n  takeover back (after a successful first takeover)\n  (bsc#1181765)\n- add dedicated logging of HANA_CALL problems. So it will be now\n  possible to identify, if the called hana command or the needed\n  su command throws the error and for further hints we log the\n  stderr output.\n  Additional it is possible to get regular log messages for the\n  used commands, their return code and their stderr output by\n  enabling the 'debug' mode of the resource agents.\n  (bsc#1182774)\n\nPackage SUSEConnect was updated:\n\n- Update to 0.3.36- Allow suseconnect-keepalive.service to recognize a configured proxy. (bsc#1200994)\n- Remove the `WantedBy` statement from suseconnect-keepalive.service since it's only to be triggered by a systemd timer.\n- SUSEConnect will now ensure that the `PROXY_ENABLED` environment variable is honored.\n- Write services with ssl_verify=no when using connect with insecure\n- Update to 0.3.35\n- Rely on system-wide defaults for enabling the keepalive timer by systemd-presets-branding-SLE. (bsc#1200641)\n- Update to 0.3.34\n- Manage the `System-Token` header. The `System-Token` header as delivered by\n  SCC will be stored inside of the credentials file for later use on API calls.\n  This way we add system clone detection for systems using this version of SUSE\n  Connect.\n- Update to 0.3.33\n- Add --keepalive command to send pings to SCC.\n- Add service/timer to periodically call --keepalive command to make system\n  information in SCC and proxies more accurate. (bsc#1196076)\n\nPackage aaa_base was updated:\n\n- Add patch git-46-78b2a0b29381c16bec6b2a8fc7eabaa9925782d7.patch  * The wrapper rootsh is not a restricted shell (bsc#1199492)\n- fix (bsc#1194883) - aaa_base: Set net.ipv4.ping_group_range to\n  allow ICMP ping\n- added patches\n  + git-40-d004657a244d75b372a107c4f6097b42ba1992d5.patch\n- Port change from Thu Sep 30 08:51:55 UTC 2022 forword to\n  current version which includes a rename of patch\n    git-13-14003c19eaa863ae9d80a0ebb9b5cab6273a5a9e.patch\n  to\n    git-43-14003c19eaa863ae9d80a0ebb9b5cab6273a5a9e.patch\n  as otherwise autopatch macro does not work anymore\n- Include all fixes and changes for systemwide inputrc to remove\n  the 8 bit escape sequence which interfere with UTF-8 multi byte\n  characters as well as support the vi mode of readline library.\n  This is done with the patches\n  * git-41-f00ca2600331602241954533a1b1610d1da57edf.patch\n  * git-42-f39a8d18719c3b34373e0e36098f0f404121b5c5.patch\n  before the changed patch\n    git-13-14003c19eaa863ae9d80a0ebb9b5cab6273a5a9e.patch\n  rename it to\n    git-43-14003c19eaa863ae9d80a0ebb9b5cab6273a5a9e.patch\n  and also add the patches\n  * git-44-425f3e9b44ba9ead865d70ff6690d5f2869442dc.patch\n  * git-45-bf0a31597d0ed3562bfc5e6be0ade2fe5dc1f7a1.patch\n\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- update add-samba-bgqd.diff:  to add new rule to fix 'DENIED' open on  /proc/{pid}/fd for samba-bgqd (bnc#1196850).\n- Add update-usr-sbin-smbd.diff to add new rule to allow reading of\n  openssl.cnf (bnc#1195463).\n\nPackage augeas was updated:\n\n- add augeas-sysctl_parsing.patch (bsc#1197443)  * backport original patch and rebase\n- support new chrony 4.1 options (jsc#SLE-17334)\n  augeas-new_options_for_chrony.patch\n\nPackage autofs was updated:\n\n- autofs-5.1.6-fix-quoted-string-length-calc-in-expand.patch  Fix problem with quote handling\n  (bsc#1181715)\n- 0005-autofs-5.1.4-fix-incorrect-locking-in-sss-lookup.patch\n  Fix locking problem that causes deadlock when sss used.\n  (bsc#1196485)\n- 0004-autofs-5.1.3-add-port-parameter-to-rpc_ping.patch\n  Suppress portmap calls when port explicitly given\n  (bsc#1195697)\n\nPackage autoyast2 was updated:\n\n- Fix detection disk serial and size in the \u0026quot;/disks\u0026quot;/ ERB helper  (bsc#1199000).\n- Fix rules validation when using a dialog (bsc#1199165).\n- 4.3.102\n- Respect general/signature-handling settings during the 2nd\n  stage (bsc#1197655).\n- 4.3.101\n- Properly handle the \u0026quot;/dopackages\u0026quot;/ option in the openFile\n  method of the AyastSetup module (bsc#1196566).\n- 4.3.100\n- Avoid login while running AutoYaST init-scripts (bsc#1196594 and\n  related to bsc#1195059).\n- 4.3.99\n- add yast namespace to merge.xslt to fix CDATA handling (bsc#1195910)\n- 4.3.98\n- Modified init-scripts service dependencies fixing a root login\n  systemd timeout when installing with ssh (bsc#1195059)\n- 4.3.97\n\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Downgrade python3-Twisted to a Recommends.

Only a single .debug_info (and .debug_types) section are\n    currently handled.\n    readelf: Handle all new DWARF5 sections.\n  - -debug-dump=info+ will show split unit DIEs when found.\n  - -dwarf-skeleton can be used when inspecting a .dwo file.\n    Recognizes GNU locviews with --debug-dump=loc.\n    libdw: New functions dwarf_die_addr_die, dwarf_get_units,\n    dwarf_getabbrevattr_data and dwarf_cu_info.\n    libdw will now try to resolve the alt file on first use of\n    an alt attribute FORM when not set yet with dwarf_set_alt.\n    dwarf_aggregate_size() now works with multi-dimensional arrays.\n    libdwfl: Use process_vm_readv when available instead of ptrace.\n    backends: Add a RISC-V backend.\n    There were various improvements to build on Windows.\n    The sha1 and md5 implementations have been removed, they weren't used.\n  - Update to version 0.170 (Martin LiÅ¡ka):\n    libdw: Added new DWARF5 attribute, tag, character encoding, language code,\n    calling convention, defaulted member function and macro constants\n    to dwarf.h.\n  New functions dwarf_default_lower_bound and dwarf_line_file.\n  dwarf_peel_type now handles DWARF5 immutable, packed and shared tags.\n  dwarf_getmacros now handles DWARF5 .debug_macro sections.\n    strip: Add -R, --remove-section=SECTION and --keep-section=SECTION.\n    backends: The bpf disassembler is now always build on all platforms.\n  - Includes changes in 0.169\n    backends: Add support for EM_PPC64 GNU_ATTRIBUTES.\n    Frame pointer unwinding fallback support for i386, x86_64, aarch64.\n    translations: Update Polish translation.\n  - CVE-2017-7611: elfutils: DoS (heap-based buffer over-read and\n    application crash) via a crafted ELF file (bnc#1033088)\n  - CVE-2017-7610: elflint: heap-based buffer overflow in check_group\n    (bnc#1033087)\n  - CVE-2017-7609: memory allocation failure in __libelf_decompress\n    (bnc#1033086)\n  - CVE-2017-7607: heap-based buffer overflow in handle_gnu_hashi\n    (readelf.c) (bnc#1033084)\n  - CVE-2017-7608: heap-based buffer overflow in\n    ebl_object_note_type_name (eblobjnotetypename.c) (bnc#1033085)\n  - CVE-2017-7613: elfutils: denial of service (memory consumption)\n    via a crafted ELF file (bnc#1033090)\n  - CVE-2017-7612: elfutils: denial of service (heap-based buffer\n    over-read and application crash) via a crafted ELF file (bnc#1033089)\n  - Removed patches:\n  - obsolete 0001-backends-Add-support-for-EM_PPC64-GNU_ATTRIBUTES.patch\n  - ppc-machine-flags.patch\n  - elflint-check-symbol-table-data-is-big-enough-before-check.patch\n  - elflint-dont-check-section-group-without-flags-word.patch\n  - libelf-check-compression-before-allocate-output-buffer.patch\n  - readelf-fix-off-by-one-sanity-check.patch\n  - use-the-empty-string-for-note-names-with-zero-size.patch\n  - elflint-sanity-check-the-number-of-phdrs-and-shdrs.patch\n  - elfutils-dont-trust-sh_entsize.patch\n- Packaging cleanups:\n  - Modernize specfile and metadata.

Restore the commit\n- commit ee9cedc\n- rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\n  Since 15.4 alternatives for /bin/sh are provided by packages\n  \u0026lt;something\u0026gt;-sh. While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- x86/speculation: Warn about Spectre v2 LFENCE mitigation\n  (bsc#1178134).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-warn-about-eibrs-lfence-unprivileged-ebpf-smt.patch.\n- commit 8588aa6\n- powerpc/mm: Fix verification of MMU_FTR_TYPE_44x (bsc#1156395).\n- commit 5c5db21\n- x86/speculation: Warn about eIBRS + LFENCE + Unprivileged eBPF +\n  SMT (bsc#1178134).\n- commit a719566\n- HID: multitouch: fix Dell Precision 7550 and 7750 button type\n  (bsc#1197243).\n- commit 53c2db3\n- Sort in upstreamed BHB patches\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/documentation-hw-vuln-update-spectre-doc.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-add-eibrs-retpoline-options.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-include-unprivileged-ebpf-status-in-spectre-v2-mitigation-reporting.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-rename-retpoline_amd-to-retpoline_lfence.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/x86-speculation-use-generic-retpoline-by-default-on-amd.patch.\n- commit 4062a7a\n- s390/mm: fix VMA and page table handling code in storage key\n  handling functions (git-fixes).\n- s390/mm: validate VMA in PGSTE manipulation functions\n  (git-fixes).\n- s390/gmap: don't unconditionally call pte_unmap_unlock()\n  in __gmap_zap() (git-fixes).\n- s390/gmap: validate VMA in __gmap_zap() (git-fixes).\n- s390/pci_mmio: fully validate the VMA before calling\n  follow_pte() (git-fixes).\n- mm: add vma_lookup(), update find_vma_intersection() comments\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 808c094\n- Revert \u0026quot;/rpm/kernel-source.spec.in: call fdupes per subpackage\u0026quot;/\n  This reverts commit 1da843983718d4cfdd652a76e428abee98e37450.\n- commit f349b81\n- Revert \u0026quot;/build initrd without systemd\u0026quot;/ (bsc#1197300)\n  This reverts commit ef4c569b998635a9369390d4e9cfe3a922815c76.\n  It seems to be the cause of a stall in OBS build that resulted in\n  the failure with obs-build-qa (and possibly others).\n- commit ff2b28e\n- net/smc: Reset conn-\u0026gt;lgr when link group registration fails\n  (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: fix using of uninitialized completions (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: fix wrong list_del in smc_lgr_cleanup_early\n  (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: Fix loop in smc_listen (git-fixes).\n- net/smc: Make sure the link_id is unique (git-fixes).\n- commit 759dc2b\n- blacklist.conf: net/smc cleanup with no functional change\n- commit 5a33cbb\n- Update patch reference for USB gadget fix (CVE-2022-27223 bsc#1197245)\n- commit fd3b6e8\n- s390/hypfs: include z/VM guests with access control group set\n  (bsc#1195640 LTC#196352).\n- commit 598f26f\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 1580ab2\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 1cdc779\n- Rename colliding patches before the next cve/linux-5.3 -\u0026gt; SLE15-SP3 merge\n- commit 891ddc4\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS.

architecture removal left a dangling link behind which\n  triggers openSUSE post-build check in kernel-source, failing\n  kernel-source build.\n  A fix deleting the danglink link has been submitted but it did not make\n  it into 5.12-rc1. Unfortunately we cannot add it as a patch as patch\n  utility does not handle symlink removal. Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master. The reason is that this can happen any time again, so\n  let's have this in packaging instead.\n- commit 52a1ad7\n- blacklist.conf: Add b4e00444cab4 fork: fix copy_process(CLONE_PARENT) race with the exiting -\u0026gt;real_parent\n- commit b1b6d4b\n\nPackage ldb was updated:\n\n- Add ldb-memory-bug-15096-4.15-ldbonly.patch to backport all  changes for ldb-2.4.4.\n  + CVE-2022-32745: samba: ldb: AD users can crash the server\n    process with an LDAP add or modify request; (bso#15008);\n    (bso#15096); (bsc#1201492).\n  + CVE-2022-2031: samba, ldb: AD users can bypass certain\n    restrictions associated with changing passwords; (bso#15047);\n    (bsc#1201495);\n  + CVE-2022-32744: samba, ldb: AD users can forge password change\n    requests for any user; (bso#15074); (bso#15047); (bsc#1201493).\n- Update to version 2.4.3\n  + Fix build problems, waf produces incorrect names for python\n    extensions; (bso#15071);\n- Update to version 2.4.2\n  + Fix for CVE-2021-3670, ensure that the LDB request has not\n    timed out during filter processing as the LDAP server\n    MaxQueryDuration is otherwise not honoured (bsc#1198397).\n\nPackage libassuan was updated:\n\n- update to 2.5.5:  * Fix a crash in the logging code\n  * Upgrade autoconf\n- update to 2.5.4:\n  * Fix some minor build annoyances\n- Update to 2.5.3:\n  * Add a timeout for writing to a SOCKS5 proxy.\n  * Add workaround for a problem with LD_LIBRARY_PATH on newer systems.\n- qemu-disable-fdpassing-test.patch: remove\n-Update to 2.5.2:\n  * configure.ac: Bump LT version to C8/A8/R2\n  * include libassuan.pc in the spec file\n\nPackage libcbor was updated:\n\n- do not build manual page for 15sp4, it does not succeed  [bsc#1197743]\n- added sources\n  + libcbor.1\n\nPackage libgpg-error was updated:\n\n- Drop --with-pic (no effect with --disable-static).- update to 1.42:\n  * Improve cross-compiling support\n  * Improve $libdir determination by gpgrt-config\n  * Support --disable-thread by gen-lock-obj.sh\n  * Interface changes relative to the 1.40 release\n    GPG_ERR_SOURCE_TPM2D\n- update to 1.41:\n  * Fixes another glitch in the \u0026quot;/ignore\u0026quot;/ meta command.\n  * Fixes two typos in the German translation.\n  * New function gpgrt_access.\n  * Make \u0026quot;/ignore\u0026quot;/ meta command work correctly in the option parser.\n  * Interface changes relative to the 1.39 release:\n  gpgrt_access                     NEW.\n- Update to 1.39:\n  * \u0026quot;/gpg-error --lib-version\u0026quot;/ works again.\n  * New function gpgrt_fcancel as alternative to gpgrt_close.

Now it is set to\n    XKB_KEY_NoSymbol instead.\n  * Improve the speed of xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() on\n    repeated calls in the same xkb_context().\n- Update to release 1.0.1\n  * Make the table output of `xkbcli how-to-type` aligned.\n- Update to release 1.0.0\n  * Now it is possible to add custom layouts and options at the\n    system (/etc) and user (~/.config) level, at least when\n    libxkbcommon is in use.\n  * libxkbregistry is a C library that lists available XKB\n    models, layouts and variants for a given ruleset. This is a\n    separate library (.so/.pc files) and aimed at tools that\n    provide a listing of available keyboard layouts to the user.\n  * Add an `xkbcli` command-line utility.\n- Update to release 0.10.0\n  * Fix quadratic complexity in the XKB file parser.\n  * Add $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb to the default search path. If\n    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, $HOME/.config/xkb is used. If\n    $HOME is not set, the path is not added. The XDG path is\n    looked up before the existing default search path $HOME/.xkb.\n  * Add support for include statements in XKB rules files.\n  * Fix bug where the merge mode only applied to the first vmod\n    in a \u0026quot;/virtual_modifiers\u0026quot;/ statement.\n  * Reject interpret modifier predicate with more than one value.\n  * Correctly handle capitalization of the ssharp keysym.\n- Update to release 0.9.1\n  * Fix context creation failing when run in privileged processes\n    as defined by `secure_getenv(3)`, e.g. GDM.\n- Update to release 0.9.0\n  * Move ~/.xkb to before XKB_CONFIG_ROOT. This enables the user\n    to have full control of the keymap definitions, instead of\n    only augmenting them.\n- Update to new upstream release 0.8.4\n  * Only changes to the build procedure.\n- Update to new upstream release 0.8.3\n  * New APIs: XKB_KEY_XF86MonBrightnessCycle,\n    XKB_KEY_XF86RotationLockToggle.\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- Security fixes:  * [CVE-2022-40303, bsc#1204366] Fix integer overflows with\n    XML_PARSE_HUGE\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40303.patch\n  * [CVE-2022-40304, bsc#1204367] Fix dict corruption caused by\n    entity reference cycles\n    + Added patch libxml2-CVE-2022-40304.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1201978, CVE-2016-3709]\n  * Cross-site scripting vulnerability after commit 960f0e2\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2016-3709.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1199132, CVE-2022-29824]\n  * Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write in buf.c\n    (xmlBuf*) and tree.c (xmlBuffer*)\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2022-29824.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1196490, CVE-2022-23308]\n  * Use-after-free of ID and IDREF attributes.\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2022-23308.patch\n  * Add libxml2-CVE-2021-3541.patch\n\nPackage libyajl was updated:\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Resolver: Fix missing --[no]-recommends initialization in  update (fixes #openSUSE/zypper#459, bsc#1201972)\n- Log ONLY_NAMESPACE_RECOMMENDED because this is what corresponds\n  to --[no]-recommends.\n- version 17.31.2 (22)\n- UsrEtc: Store logrotate files in %{_distconfdir} if defined\n  (fixes #402)\n- Log backtrace on SIGABRT too.\n- Need to explicitly enable building experimental code. Otherwise\n  an old Notcurses++ package which happens to be present in the\n  buildenv breaks the build (fixes #412).\n- Work around libyui/libyui#78 on code 15.4 and older.\n- Stop using std::*ary_function; deprecated and removed in c++17.\n- Don't expose header files which use types not available in\n  c++11.

First reason for this is that MediaNetwork was just meant\n  as a way to test the new CURL based downloader and second: since\n  the Provide API is going to completely replace the current media\n  backend it would be extra work to ensure that changes on the\n  Downloader do not break MediaNetwork.\n- version 17.31.0 (22)\n- Fix building with GCC 12.x release (#396)\n- version 17.30.3 (22)\n- appdata plugin: Pass path to the repodata/ directory inside the\n  cache (bsc#1197684)\n- zypp-rpm: flush rpm script output buffer before sending\n  endOfScriptTag.\n- version 17.30.2 (22)\n- PluginRepoverification: initial version hooked into\n  repo::Downloader and repo refresh.\n- Immediately start monitoring the download.transfer_timeout.\n  Do not wait until the first data arrived.

This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not\n    support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub\n    code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).\n  * Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as\n    intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for\n    libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.\n  * Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate\n    constants in libseccomp-golang.\n  * When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,\n    to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.\n  * Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.\n  * Various CI fixes.\n  * Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.\n  * runc static binaries are now linked against libseccomp v2.5.4.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3474\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with newer syscalls (namely faccessat2) on older kernels on s390(x) caused by\n  that platform's syscall multiplexing semantics. bsc#1192051 bsc#1199565\n  + bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Add ExcludeArch for s390 (not s390x) since we've never supported it.\n- Update to runc v1.1.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2.\n  CVE-2022-29162 bsc#1199460\n  * A bug was found in runc where runc exec --cap executed processes with\n    non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux\n    environment. For more information, see [GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66][] and\n    CVE-2022-29162. bsc#1199460\n  * `runc spec` no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created\n    example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.\n- Update to runc v1.1.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.1.\n  * runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,\n    rather than error out. (#3355)\n  * runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)\n    libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files\n    listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's\n    cgroup. (#3387, #3404)\n  * Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus \u0026quot;/Intel RDT is not supported\u0026quot;/\n    error. (#3406)\n  * libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat\n    of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n  - libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being\n    correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This\n    should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and\n    incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0~rc1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.\n  + Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.\n  * runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.\n    This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures\n    (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent\n    binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.\n  + runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.\n    This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after\n    the container hasï¿¼exited.\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD\n    (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows\n    users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be\n    efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.\n  + checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set\n    a different LSM mount context on restore.\n  + intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.\n  + runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup\n    to use for the process being executed.\n  + cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1\n    machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc\n    run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).\n  + sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s\n    behaviour.\n  + mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching\n    the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any\n    additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to\n    have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have\n    restrictive access control settings for other users.\n  + Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These\n    have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r\n    to the option name (such as rro).\n  + Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features\n    runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as\n    supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this\n    command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc\n    1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is\n    being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.\n  * system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.\n  * cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change\n    the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per\n    /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container\n    process.\n  * runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount\n    which destination is a symlink.\n  * cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.\n    runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused\n    container.\n  * runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of\n    exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.\n- Update version data embedded in binary to correctly include the git commit of\n  the release.\n- Drop runc-rpmlintrc because we don't have runc-test anymore.\n  bsc#1193436\n\nPackage samba was updated:\n\n- CVE-2022-32746: samba: Use-after-free occurring in database  audit logging;

When listing, extractng and comparing, zstd compressed\n    archives are recognized automatically. When '-a' option is in\n    effect, zstd compression is selected if the destination archive\n    name ends in '.zst' or '.tzst'.\n  * The -K option interacts properly with member names given in the\n    command line. Names of members to extract can be specified along\n    with the \u0026quot;/-K NAME\u0026quot;/ option. In this case, tar will extract NAME\n    and those of named members that appear in the archive after it,\n    which is consistent with the semantics of the option. Previous\n    versions of tar extracted NAME, those of named members that\n    appeared before it, and everything after it.\n  * Fix CVE-2018-20482 - When creating archives with the --sparse\n    option, previous versions of tar would loop endlessly if a\n    sparse file had been truncated while being archived.\n- remove the following patches (upstreamed)\n  * tar-1.30-tests-difflink.patch\n  * tar-1.30-tests_dirrem_race.patch\n- refresh add_readme-tests.patch\n- add tar-1.31-tests_dirrem.patch to fix expected output in dirrem\n  tests\n- add tar-1.31-racy_compress_tests.patch to fix

      "Description": "x86: Speculative vulnerabilities with bare (non-shim) 32-bit PV guests 32-bit x86 PV guest kernels run in ring 1. At the time when Xen was developed, this area of the i386 architecture was rarely used, which is why Xen was able to use it to implement paravirtualisation, Xen's novel approach to virtualization. In AMD64, Xen had to use a different implementation approach, so Xen does not use ring 1 to support 64-bit guests. With the focus now being on 64-bit systems, and the availability of explicit hardware support for virtualization, fixing speculation issues in ring 1 is not a priority for processor companies. Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is an architectural x86 extension put together to combat speculative execution sidechannel attacks, including Spectre v2. It was retrofitted in microcode to existing CPUs. For more details on Spectre v2, see: http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html However, IBRS does not architecturally protect ring 0 from predictions learnt in ring 1. For more details, see: https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/deep-dives/deep-dive-indirect-branch-restricted-speculation Similar situations may exist with other mitigations for other kinds of speculative execution attacks. The situation is quite likely to be similar for speculative execution attacks which have yet to be discovered, disclosed, or mitigated.",

The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.",

      "Description": "Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache Traffic Server with `puma`.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-0778",
      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3).

This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",

The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf-\u003ealloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.",

      "Description": "HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn-\u003eget_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst-\u003eheader('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.",

      "Description": "TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and allows times to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular expression `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.",
