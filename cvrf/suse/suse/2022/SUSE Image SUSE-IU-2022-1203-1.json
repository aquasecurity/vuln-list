While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 95d7e2c\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: fix packet alignment padding\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 065384f\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit f59903f\n- Update patches.suse/sr9700-sanity-check-for-packet-length.patch\n  (bac#1196836 CVE-2022-26966).\n  added CVE number\n- commit 7e940d6\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS.

Add a temporary band-aid which\n  deletes all dangling symlinks after unpacking the kernel source tarball.\n  [jslaby] It's not that temporary as we are dragging this for quite some\n  time in master.

It is limited to 6 by default.\n  * The ``target`` object of the XMLParser can have ``start_ns()`` and ``end_ns()``\n    callback methods to listen to namespace declarations.\n  * The ``TreeBuilder`` has new arguments ``comment_factory`` and ``pi_factory`` to\n    pass factories for creating comments and processing instructions, as well as\n    flag arguments ``insert_comments`` and ``insert_pis`` to discard them from the\n    tree when set to false.\n  * A `C14N 2.0 \u0026lt;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n2/\u0026gt;`_ implementation was added as\n    ``etree.canonicalize()``, a corresponding ``C14NWriterTarget`` class, and\n    a ``c14n2`` serialisation method.\n  * bugfixes, see CHANGES.txt\n- deleted sources\n  - lxmldoc-4.3.3.pdf (renamed)\n- added sources\n  + lxmldoc-4.4.0.pdf\n  + world.txt\n- Update to 4.3.4\n  * Rebuilt with Cython 0.29.10 to support Python 3.8.\n    Note: documentation is not updated\n- Remove generated files\n- Update to 4.3.3:\n  * Fix leak of output buffer and unclosed files in ``_XSLTResultTree.write_output()``.\n- Update to 4.3.2:\n  * Crash in 4.3.1 when appending a child subtree with certain text nodes.\n- Update to v4.3.1\n  * Fixed crash when appending a child subtree that contains unsubstituted\n    entity references\n- from v4.3.0\n  * Features\n    + The module ``lxml.sax`` is compiled using Cython in order to speed it up.\n    + lxml.sax.ElementTreeProducer now preserves the namespace prefixes.\n    If two prefixes point to the same URI, the first prefix in alphabetical\n    order is used.\n    + Updated ISO-Schematron implementation to 2013 version (now MIT licensed)\n    and the corresponding schema to the 2016 version (with optional \u0026quot;/properties\u0026quot;/).\n  * Other\n    + Support for Python 2.6 and 3.3 was removed.\n    + The minimum dependency versions were raised to libxml2 2.9.2 and libxslt 1.1.27,\n    which were released in 2014 and 2012 respectively.\n- from v4.2.6\n  * Fix a DeprecationWarning in Py3.7+.\n  * Import warnings in Python 3.6+ were resolved.\n- Remove no longer needed\n  0001-Make-test-more-resilient-against-changes-in-latest-l.patch\n- Remove superfluous devel dependency for noarch package\n- Update to 4.2.5\n  * Javascript URLs that used URL escaping were not removed by the HTML cleaner.\n    Security problem found by Omar Eissa.\n- Fix threading tests patch for 42.3\n  * Add 0001-Make-test-more-resilient-against-changes-in-latest-l.patch\n  * Remove python-lxml-assert.patch\n- Update to 4.2.4 (2018-08-03)\n  + Features added\n  * GH#259: Allow using ``pkg-config`` for build configuration.\n    Patch by Patrick Griffis.\n  + Bugs fixed\n  * LP#1773749, GH#268: Crash when moving an element to another document with\n    ``Element.insert()``.\n    Patch by Alexander Weggerle.\n- Update to 4.2.3\n  + Bugs fixed\n  * Reverted GH#265: lxml links against zlib as a shared library again.\n- Update to 4.2.2\n  + Bugs fixed\n  * GH#266: Fix sporadic crash during GC when parse-time schema validation is used\n    and the parser participates in a reference cycle.\n    Original patch by Julien Greard.\n  * GH#265: lxml no longer links against zlib as a shared library, only on static builds.\n    Patch by Nehal J Wani.\n- Version update to 4.2.1:\n  * LP#1755825: iterwalk() failed to return the 'start' event for the initial\n    element if a tag selector is used.\n  * LP#1756314: Failure to import 4.2.0 into PyPy due to a missing library symbol.\n  * LP#1727864, GH#258: Add \u0026quot;/-isysroot\u0026quot;/ linker option on MacOS as needed by XCode 9.\n- Version update to 4.2.0:\n  * GH#255: ``SelectElement.value`` returns more standard-compliant and\n    browser-like defaults for non-multi-selects.  If no option is selected, the\n    value of the first option is returned (instead of None).

Upstream changelog is available from  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.4.\n  * Fix mounting via wrong proc fd. When the user and mount namespaces are\n    used, and the bind mount is followed by the cgroup mount in the spec,\n    the cgroup was mounted using the bind mount's mount fd.\n  * Switch kill() in libcontainer/nsenter to sane_kill().\n  * Fix \u0026quot;/permission denied\u0026quot;/ error from runc run on noexec fs.\n  * Fix failed exec after systemctl daemon-reload. Due to a regression\n    in v1.1.3, the DeviceAllow=char-pts rwm rule was no longer added and\n    was causing an error open /dev/pts/0: operation not permitted: unknown when systemd was reloaded.\n    (boo#1202821)\n- Update to runc v1.1.3. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.3.\n  (Includes a fix for bsc#1200088.)\n  * Our seccomp `-ENOSYS` stub now correctly handles multiplexed syscalls on\n    s390 and s390x. This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not\n    support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub\n    code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).\n  * Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as\n    intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for\n    libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.\n  * Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate\n    constants in libseccomp-golang.\n  * When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,\n    to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.\n  * Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.\n  * Various CI fixes.\n  * Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.\n  * runc static binaries are now linked against libseccomp v2.5.4.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3474\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with newer syscalls (namely faccessat2) on older kernels on s390(x) caused by\n  that platform's syscall multiplexing semantics. bsc#1192051 bsc#1199565\n  + bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Add ExcludeArch for s390 (not s390x) since we've never supported it.\n- Update to runc v1.1.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2.\n  CVE-2022-29162 bsc#1199460\n  * A bug was found in runc where runc exec --cap executed processes with\n    non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux\n    environment. For more information, see [GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66][] and\n    CVE-2022-29162. bsc#1199460\n  * `runc spec` no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created\n    example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.\n- Update to runc v1.1.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.1.\n  * runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,\n    rather than error out. (#3355)\n  * runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)\n    libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files\n    listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's\n    cgroup. (#3387, #3404)\n  * Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus \u0026quot;/Intel RDT is not supported\u0026quot;/\n    error. (#3406)\n  * libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat\n    of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n  - libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being\n    correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This\n    should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and\n    incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0~rc1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.\n  + Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.\n  * runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.\n    This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures\n    (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent\n    binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.\n  + runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.\n    This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after\n    the container hasÃ¯Â¿Â¼exited.\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD\n    (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows\n    users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be\n    efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.\n  + checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set\n    a different LSM mount context on restore.\n  + intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.\n  + runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup\n    to use for the process being executed.\n  + cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1\n    machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc\n    run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).\n  + sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s\n    behaviour.\n  + mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching\n    the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any\n    additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to\n    have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have\n    restrictive access control settings for other users.\n  + Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These\n    have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r\n    to the option name (such as rro).\n  + Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features\n    runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as\n    supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this\n    command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc\n    1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is\n    being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.\n  * system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.\n  * cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change\n    the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per\n    /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container\n    process.\n  * runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount\n    which destination is a symlink.\n  * cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.\n    runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused\n    container.\n  * runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of\n    exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.\n- Update version data embedded in binary to correctly include the git commit of\n  the release.\n- Drop runc-rpmlintrc because we don't have runc-test anymore.\n  bsc#1193436\n\nPackage salt was updated:\n\n- Handle non-UTF-8 bytes in core grains generation (bsc#1202165)- Fix Syndic authentication errors (bsc#1199562)\n- Add Amazon EC2 detection for

[boo#1201783]\n- update to 3.39.1:\n  * Fix an incorrect result from a query that uses a view that\n    contains a compound SELECT in which only one arm contains a\n    RIGHT JOIN and where the view is not the first FROM clause term\n    of the query that contains the view\n  * Fix a long-standing problem with ALTER TABLE RENAME that can\n    only arise if the sqlite3_limit(SQLITE_LIMIT_SQL_LENGTH) is set\n    to a very small value.\n  * Fix a long-standing problem in FTS3 that can only arise when\n    compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS compile-time\n    option.\n  * Fix the initial-prefix optimization for the REGEXP extension so\n    that it works correctly even if the prefix contains characters\n    that require a 3-byte UTF8 encoding.\n  * Enhance the sqlite_stmt virtual table so that it buffers all of\n    its output.\n- update to 3.39.0:\n  * Add (long overdue) support for RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN\n  * Add new binary comparison operators IS NOT DISTINCT FROM and\n    IS DISTINCT FROM that are equivalent to IS and IS NOT,\n    respective, for compatibility with PostgreSQL and SQL standards\n  * Add a new return code (value \u0026quot;/3\u0026quot;/) from the sqlite3_vtab_distinct()\n    interface that indicates a query that has both DISTINCT and\n    ORDER BY clauses\n  * Added the sqlite3_db_name() interface\n  * The unix os interface resolves all symbolic links in database\n    filenames to create a canonical name for the database before\n    the file is opened\n  * Defer materializing views until the materialization is actually\n    needed, thus avoiding unnecessary work if the materialization\n    turns out to never be used\n  * The HAVING clause of a SELECT statement is now allowed on any\n    aggregate query, even queries that do not have a GROUP BY\n    clause\n  * Many microoptimizations collectively reduce CPU cycles by about\n    2.3%.\n- drop sqlite-src-3380100-atof1.patch, included upstream\n- add sqlite-src-3390000-func7-pg-181.patch to skip float precision\n  related test failures on 32 bit\n- update to 3.38.5:\n  * Fix a blunder in the CLI of the 3.38.4 release\n- includes changes from 3.38.4:\n  * fix a byte-code problem in the Bloom filter pull-down\n    optimization added by release 3.38.0 in which an error in the\n    byte code causes the byte code engine to enter an infinite loop\n    when the pull-down optimization encounters a NULL key\n- update to 3.38.3:\n  * Fix a case of the query planner be overly aggressive with\n    optimizing automatic-index and Bloom-filter construction,\n    using inappropriate ON clause terms to restrict the size of the\n    automatic-index or Bloom filter, and resulting in missing rows\n    in the output.\n  * Other minor patches. See the timeline for details.\n- update to 3.38.2:\n  * Fix a problem with the Bloom filter optimization that might\n    cause an incorrect answer when doing a LEFT JOIN with a WHERE\n    clause constraint that says that one of the columns on the\n    right table of the LEFT JOIN is NULL.\n  * Other minor patches.\n- Remove obsolete configure flags\n- Package the Tcl bindings here again so that we only ship one copy\n  of SQLite (bsc#1195773).\n- update to 3.38.1:\n  * Fix problems with the new Bloom filter optimization that might\n    cause some obscure queries to get an incorrect answer.\n  * Fix the localtime modifier of the date and time functions so\n    that it preserves fractional seconds.\n  * Fix the sqlite_offset SQL function so that it works correctly\n    even in corner cases such as when the argument is a virtual\n    column or the column of a view.\n  * Fix row value IN operator constraints on virtual tables so that\n    they work correctly even if the virtual table implementation\n    relies on bytecode to filter rows that do not satisfy the\n    constraint.\n  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements, test cases, and\n    documentation. See the source code timeline for details.\n- add upstream patch to run atof1 tests only on x86_64\n  sqlite-src-3380100-atof1.patch\n- update to 3.38.0\n  * Add the -\u0026gt; and -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; operators for easier processing of JSON\n  * The JSON functions are now built-ins\n  * Enhancements to date and time functions\n  * Rename the printf() SQL function to format() for better\n    compatibility, with alias for backwards compatibility.\n  * Add the sqlite3_error_offset() interface for helping localize\n    an SQL error to a specific character in the input SQL text\n  * Enhance the interface to virtual tables\n  * CLI columnar output modes are enhanced to correctly handle tabs\n    and newlines embedded in text, and add options like \u0026quot;/--wrap N\u0026quot;/,\n    \u0026quot;/--wordwrap on\u0026quot;/, and \u0026quot;/--quote\u0026quot;/ to the columnar output modes.\n  * Query planner enhancements using a Bloom filter to speed up\n    large analytic queries, and a balanced merge tree to evaluate\n    UNION or UNION ALL compound SELECT statements that have an\n    ORDER BY clause.\n  * The ALTER TABLE statement is changed to silently ignores\n    entries in the sqlite_schema table that do not parse when\n    PRAGMA writable_schema=ON\n- update to 3.37.2:\n  * Fix a bug introduced in version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) that can\n    cause database corruption if a SAVEPOINT is rolled back while\n    in PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY mode, and other changes are made,\n    and then the outer transaction commits\n  * Fix a long-standing problem with ON DELETE CASCADE and ON\n    UPDATE CASCADE in which a cache of the bytecode used to\n    implement the cascading change was not being reset following a\n    local DDL change\n- update to 3.37.1:\n  * Fix a bug introduced by the UPSERT enhancements of version\n    3.35.0 that can cause incorrect byte-code to be generated for\n    some obscure but valid SQL, possibly resulting in a NULL-\n    pointer dereference.\n  * Fix an OOB read that can occur in FTS5 when reading corrupt\n    database files.\n  * Improved robustness of the --safe option in the CLI.\n  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements and test cases.\n- SQLite3 3.37.0:\n  * STRICT tables provide a prescriptive style of data type\n    management, for developers who prefer that kind of thing.\n  * When adding columns that contain a CHECK constraint or a\n    generated column containing a NOT NULL constraint, the\n    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN now checks new constraints against\n    preexisting rows in the database and will only proceed if no\n    constraints are violated.\n  * Added the PRAGMA table_list statement.\n  * Add the .connection command, allowing the CLI to keep multiple\n    database connections open at the same time.\n  * Add the --safe command-line option that disables dot-commands\n    and SQL statements that might cause side-effects that extend\n    beyond the single database file named on the command-line.\n  * CLI: Performance improvements when reading SQL statements that\n    span many lines.\n  * Added the sqlite3_autovacuum_pages() interface.\n  * The sqlite3_deserialize() does not and has never worked\n    for the TEMP database. That limitation is now noted in the\n    documentation.\n  * The query planner now omits ORDER BY clauses on subqueries and\n    views if removing those clauses does not change the semantics\n    of the query.\n  * The generate_series table-valued function extension is modified\n    so that the first parameter (\u0026quot;/START\u0026quot;/) is now required.

When listing, extractng and comparing, zstd compressed\n    archives are recognized automatically. When '-a' option is in\n    effect, zstd compression is selected if the destination archive\n    name ends in '.zst' or '.tzst'.\n  * The -K option interacts properly with member names given in the\n    command line. Names of members to extract can be specified along\n    with the \u0026quot;/-K NAME\u0026quot;/ option. In this case, tar will extract NAME\n    and those of named members that appear in the archive after it,\n    which is consistent with the semantics of the option. Previous\n    versions of tar extracted NAME, those of named members that\n    appeared before it, and everything after it.\n  * Fix CVE-2018-20482 - When creating archives with the --sparse\n    option, previous versions of tar would loop endlessly if a\n    sparse file had been truncated while being archived.\n- remove the following patches (upstreamed)\n  * tar-1.30-tests-difflink.patch\n  * tar-1.30-tests_dirrem_race.patch\n- refresh add_readme-tests.patch\n- add tar-1.31-tests_dirrem.patch to fix expected output in dirrem\n  tests\n- add tar-1.31-racy_compress_tests.patch to fix

      "Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability. A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories.",

      "Description": "The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content. In the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone was used to determine the type of document during push and pull operations. Documents that contain both “manifests” and “layers” fields could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of an accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content differently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require that a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clients pulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or “manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update to version 1.0.1 of the spec.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-0778",
      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

      "Description": "In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3).

      "Description": "Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042",

It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence.

This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12.

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.",
