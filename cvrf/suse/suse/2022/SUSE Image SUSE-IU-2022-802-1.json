So move this patch\n  to later in series.conf, outside of the sorted section, making\n  series_sort.py happy.\n- commit a65cae5\n- ALSA: kABI workaround for snd_pcm_runtime changes (CVE-2022-1048\n  bsc#1197331).\n- commit 86d43c7\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prealloc proc writes\n  (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prepare and\n  hw_params/hw_free calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent read/write and buffer\n  changes (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free\n  calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- commit e5bbf41\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prealloc proc writes\n  (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prepare and\n  hw_params/hw_free calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent read/write and buffer\n  changes (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free\n  calls (CVE-2022-1048 bsc#1197331).\n- commit 0f72275\n- macros.kernel-source: Fix conditional expansion.\n  Fixes: bb95fef3cf19 (\u0026quot;/rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\u0026quot;/)\n- commit 7e857f7\n- rpm: Use bash for %() expansion (jsc#SLE-18234).\n  Since 15.4 alternatives for /bin/sh are provided by packages\n  \u0026lt;something\u0026gt;-sh. While the interpreter for the build script can be\n  selected the interpreter for %() cannot.\n  The kernel spec files use bashisms in %().\n  While this could technically be fixed there is more serious underlying\n  problem: neither bash nor any of the alternatives are 100% POSIX\n  compliant nor bug-free.\n  It is not my intent to maintain bug compatibility with any number of\n  shells for shell scripts embedded in the kernel spec file. The spec file\n  syntax is not documented so embedding the shell script in it causes some\n  unspecified transformation to be applied to it. That means that\n  ultimately any changes must be tested by building the kernel, n times if\n  n shells are supported.\n  To reduce maintenance effort require that bash is used for kernel build\n  always.\n- commit bb95fef\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 95d7e2c\n- net: usb: ax88179_178a: fix packet alignment padding\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit 065384f\n- ax88179_178a: Merge memcpy + le32_to_cpus to get_unaligned_le32\n  (bsc#1196018).\n- commit f59903f\n- Update patches.suse/sr9700-sanity-check-for-packet-length.patch\n  (bac#1196836 CVE-2022-26966).\n  added CVE number\n- commit 7e940d6\n- rpm: Run external scriptlets on uninstall only when available\n  (bsc#1196514 bsc#1196114 bsc#1196942).\n  When dependency cycles are encountered package dependencies may not be\n  fulfilled during zypper transaction at the time scriptlets are run.\n  This is a problem for kernel scriptlets provided by suse-module-tools\n  when migrating to a SLE release that provides these scriptlets only as\n  part of LTSS.

This solves the issue where syscalls the host kernel did not\n    support would return `-EPERM` despite the existence of the `-ENOSYS` stub\n    code (this was due to how s390x does syscall multiplexing).\n  * Retry on dbus disconnect logic in libcontainer/cgroups/systemd now works as\n    intended; this fix does not affect runc binary itself but is important for\n    libcontainer users such as Kubernetes.\n  * Inability to compile with recent clang due to an issue with duplicate\n    constants in libseccomp-golang.\n  * When using systemd cgroup driver, skip adding device paths that don't exist,\n    to stop systemd from emitting warnings about those paths.\n  * Socket activation was failing when more than 3 sockets were used.\n  * Various CI fixes.\n  * Allow to bind mount /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid to inside container.\n  * runc static binaries are now linked against libseccomp v2.5.4.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  - bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3474\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with newer syscalls (namely faccessat2) on older kernels on s390(x) caused by\n  that platform's syscall multiplexing semantics. bsc#1192051 bsc#1199565\n  + bsc1192051-0001-seccomp-enosys-always-return-ENOSYS-for-setup-2-on-s390x.patch\n- Add ExcludeArch for s390 (not s390x) since we've never supported it.\n- Update to runc v1.1.2.

For more information, see [GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66][] and\n    CVE-2022-29162. bsc#1199460\n  * `runc spec` no longer sets any inheritable capabilities in the created\n    example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.\n- Update to runc v1.1.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.1.\n  * runc run/start can now run a container with read-only /dev in OCI spec,\n    rather than error out. (#3355)\n  * runc exec now ensures that --cgroup argument is a sub-cgroup. (#3403)\n    libcontainer systemd v2 manager no longer errors out if one of the files\n    listed in /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate do not exist in container's\n    cgroup. (#3387, #3404)\n  * Loosen OCI spec validation to avoid bogus \u0026quot;/Intel RDT is not supported\u0026quot;/\n    error. (#3406)\n  * libcontainer/cgroups no longer panics in cgroup v1 managers if stat\n    of /sys/fs/cgroup/unified returns an error other than ENOENT. (#3435)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0.\n  - libcontainer will now refuse to build without the nsenter package being\n    correctly compiled (specifically this requires CGO to be enabled). This\n    should avoid folks accidentally creating broken runc binaries (and\n    incorrectly importing our internal libraries into their projects). (#3331)\n- Update to runc v1.1.0~rc1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1.\n  + Add support for RDMA cgroup added in Linux 4.11.\n  * runc exec now produces exit code of 255 when the exec failed.\n    This may help in distinguishing between runc exec failures\n    (such as invalid options, non-running container or non-existent\n    binary etc.) and failures of the command being executed.\n  + runc run: new --keep option to skip removal exited containers artefacts.\n    This might be useful to check the state (e.g. of cgroup controllers) after\n    the container hasÃ¯Â¿Â¼exited.\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS and SCMP_ACT_KILL_THREAD\n    (the latter is just an alias for SCMP_ACT_KILL).\n  + seccomp: add support for SCMP_ACT_NOTIFY (seccomp actions). This allows\n    users to create sophisticated seccomp filters where syscalls can be\n    efficiently emulated by privileged processes on the host.\n  + checkpoint/restore: add an option (--lsm-mount-context) to set\n    a different LSM mount context on restore.\n  + intelrdt: support ClosID parameter.\n  + runc exec --cgroup: an option to specify a (non-top) in-container cgroup\n    to use for the process being executed.\n  + cgroup v1 controllers now support hybrid hierarchy (i.e. when on a cgroup v1\n    machine a cgroup2 filesystem is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/unified, runc\n    run/exec now adds the container to the appropriate cgroup under it).\n  + sysctl: allow slashes in sysctl names, to better match sysctl(8)'s\n    behaviour.\n  + mounts: add support for bind-mounts which are inaccessible after switching\n    the user namespace. Note that this does not permit the container any\n    additional access to the host filesystem, it simply allows containers to\n    have bind-mounts configured for paths the user can access but have\n    restrictive access control settings for other users.\n  + Add support for recursive mount attributes using mount_setattr(2). These\n    have the same names as the proposed mount(8) options -- just prepend r\n    to the option name (such as rro).\n  + Add runc features subcommand to allow runc users to detect what features\n    runc has been built with. This includes critical information such as\n    supported mount flags, hook names, and so on. Note that the output of this\n    command is subject to change and will not be considered stable until runc\n    1.2 at the earliest. The runtime-spec specification for this feature is\n    being developed in opencontainers/runtime-spec#1130.\n  * system: improve performance of /proc/$pid/stat parsing.\n  * cgroup2: when /sys/fs/cgroup is configured as a read-write mount, change\n    the ownership of certain cgroup control files (as per\n    /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate) to allow for proper deferral to the container\n    process.\n  * runc checkpoint/restore: fixed for containers with an external bind mount\n    which destination is a symlink.\n  * cgroup: improve openat2 handling for cgroup directory handle hardening.\n    runc delete -f now succeeds (rather than timing out) on a paused\n    container.\n  * runc run/start/exec now refuses a frozen cgroup (paused container in case of\n    exec). Users can disable this using --ignore-paused.\n- Update version data embedded in binary to correctly include the git commit of\n  the release.\n- Drop runc-rpmlintrc because we don't have runc-test anymore.\n  bsc#1193436\n\nPackage samba was updated:\n\n- Adjust systemd tmpfiles.d configuration, use /run/samba instead of  /var/run/samba; (bsc#1134046);\n- CVE-2021-44142: Out-of-Bound Read/Write on Samba vfs_fruit\n  module; (bsc#1194859); (bso#14914).\n\nPackage sapconf was updated:\n\n- version update from 5.0.3 to 5.0.4- change block device handling to handle multipath devices\n  correctly.

So don't mark it as deprecated too\n\nPackage tar was updated:\n\n- tests-skip-time01-on-32bit-time_t.patch: Add patch to skip test  'tests/time01.at' on platforms with 32-bit time_t for now.\n- tar.spec: Reference it.\n  (%check): Output the testsuite.log in case the testsuite failed.\n- The following issues have already been fixed in this package but\n  weren't previously mentioned in the changes file:\n  * bsc#1181131, CVE-2021-20193\n  * bsc#1120610\n- GNU tar 1.34:\n  * Fix extraction over pipe\n  * Fix memory leak in read_header\n  * Fix extraction when . and .. are unreadable\n  * Gracefully handle duplicate symlinks when extracting\n  * Re-initialize supplementary groups when switching to user\n    privileges\n- GNU tar 1.33:\n  * POSIX extended format headers do not include PID by default\n  * --delay-directory-restore works for archives with reversed\n    member ordering\n  * Fix extraction of a symbolic link hardlinked to another\n    symbolic link\n  * Wildcards in exclude-vcs-ignore mode don't match slash\n  * Fix the --no-overwrite-dir option\n  * Fix handling of chained renames in incremental backups\n  * Link counting works for file names supplied with -T\n  * Accept only position-sensitive (file-selection) options in file\n    list files\n- remove deprecated texinfo packaging macros\n- prepare usrmerge (boo#1029961)\n- Drop Requires(pre) info in the preamble: the main package does\n  not contain any info files, and has not even a pre script.

When listing, extractng and comparing, zstd compressed\n    archives are recognized automatically. When '-a' option is in\n    effect, zstd compression is selected if the destination archive\n    name ends in '.zst' or '.tzst'.\n  * The -K option interacts properly with member names given in the\n    command line. Names of members to extract can be specified along\n    with the \u0026quot;/-K NAME\u0026quot;/ option. In this case, tar will extract NAME\n    and those of named members that appear in the archive after it,\n    which is consistent with the semantics of the option. Previous\n    versions of tar extracted NAME, those of named members that\n    appeared before it, and everything after it.\n  * Fix CVE-2018-20482 - When creating archives with the --sparse\n    option, previous versions of tar would loop endlessly if a\n    sparse file had been truncated while being archived.\n- remove the following patches (upstreamed)\n  * tar-1.30-tests-difflink.patch\n  * tar-1.30-tests_dirrem_race.patch\n- refresh add_readme-tests.patch\n- add tar-1.31-tests_dirrem.patch to fix expected output in dirrem\n  tests\n- add tar-1.31-racy_compress_tests.patch to fix

A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry. This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that any configured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.",

A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories.",

Documents that contain both \"manifests\" and \"layers\" fields could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of an accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content differently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require that a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clients pulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document that contains both \"manifests\" and \"layers\" fields or \"manifests\" and \"config\" fields if they are unable to update to version 1.0.1 of the spec.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-0778",
      "Description": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).",

      "Description": "In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3).

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.",
