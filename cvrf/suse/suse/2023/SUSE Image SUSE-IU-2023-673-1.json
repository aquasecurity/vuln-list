The function DH_check() performs\n    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it\n    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\n    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A\n    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus\n    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if\n    q is larger than p. If DH_check() is called with such q parameter\n    value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the\n    computationally intensive checks are skipped.\n  * Add openssl-1_1-CVE-2023-3817.patch\n\n- Dont pass zero length input to EVP_Cipher because assembler\n  optimized AES cannot handle zero size. [bsc#1213517]\n  * Add openssl-dont-pass-zero-length-input-to-EVP_Cipher.patch\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1213487, CVE-2023-3446]\n  * Fix DH_check() excessive time with over sized modulus.\n  * The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters.\n    One of those checks confirms that the modulus (\u0026quot;p\u0026quot; parameter) is\n    not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks\n    use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found\n    to be too large.\n    A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Reworked the Fix for the Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n    The previous fix for this timing side channel turned out to cause\n    a severe 2-3x performance regression in the typical use case\n    compared to 1.1.1s.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2022-4304.patch\n  * Removed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n  * Refreshed openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n\n- Update further expiring certificates that affect tests [bsc#1201627]\n  * Add openssl-Update-further-expiring-certificates.patch\n\nPackage parted was updated:\n\n- fix null pointer dereference (bsc#1193412)  - add: parted-fix-check-diskp-in-do_name.patch\n- update mkpart options in manpage (bsc#1182142)\n  - add: parted-mkpart-manpage.patch\n\nPackage pcre2 was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1213514, CVE-2022-41409]  * Integer overflow vulnerability in pcre2test before 10.41\n    allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other\n    unspecified impacts via negative input.\n  * Add pcre2-CVE-2022-41409.patch\n\nPackage procps was updated:\n\n- Add patch CVE-2023-4016.patch  * CVE-2023-4016: ps buffer overflow (bsc#1214290)\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- Security update:  * [CVE-2023-39615, bsc#1214768] Crafted xml can cause global\n    buffer overflow\n  - Added file libxml2-CVE-2023-39615.patch\n\nPackage libyajl was updated:\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Fixup changes for 17.31.16.

To achieve a successful decryption an attacker\nwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for\ndecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,\nRSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\n\nFor example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an\nencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a\ngenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send\ntrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a\nsufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master\nsecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the\napplication data sent over that connection.\n\n",

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available.

This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.\n\nThe exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con-\u003ehttp)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",
