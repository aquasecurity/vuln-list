This flaw was addressed by adding a new\n    update-quota option that controls the maximum number of\n    outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that named can hold in a queue\n    at any given time (default: 100). (CVE-2022-3094)\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG query\n    was received and stale-answer-client-timeout was set to a\n    non-zero value. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3736)\n  * named running as a resolver with the\n    stale-answer-client-timeout option set to any value greater\n    than 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when the\n    recursive-clients soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.\n    (CVE-2022-3924)\n  New Features:\n  * The new update-quota option can be used to control the number\n    of simultaneous DNS UPDATE messages that can be processed to\n    update an authoritative zone on a primary server, or forwarded\n    to the primary server by a secondary server. The default is\n    100. A new statistics counter has also been added to record\n    events when this quota is exceeded, and the version numbers for\n    the XML and JSON statistics schemas have been updated.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) feature in BIND\n    has been deprecated. Configuring DSCP values in named.conf now\n    causes a warning to be logged. Note that this feature has only\n    been partly operational since the new Network Manager was\n    introduced in BIND 9.16.0.\n  * The catalog zone implementation has been optimized to work with\n    hundreds of thousands of member zones.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * In certain query resolution scenarios (e.g. when following\n    CNAME records), named configured to answer from stale cache\n    could return a SERVFAIL response despite a usable, non-stale\n    answer being present in the cache. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1207471, bsc#1207473, bsc#1207475, jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.36\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The auto-dnssec option has been deprecated and will be removed\n    in a future BIND 9.19.x release. Please migrate to\n    dnssec-policy.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When a catalog zone was removed from the configuration, in some\n    cases a dangling pointer could cause the named process to\n    crash.\n  * When a zone was deleted from a server, a key management object\n    related to that zone was inadvertently kept in memory and only\n    released upon shutdown. This could lead to constantly\n    increasing memory use on servers with a high rate of changes\n    affecting the set of zones being served.\n  * In certain cases, named waited for the resolution of\n    outstanding recursive queries to finish before shutting down.\n  * The zone \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;class\u0026gt;: final reference detached log message\n    was moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to\n    prevent the named-checkzone tool from superfluously logging\n    this message in non-debug mode.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage c-ares was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.19.0  Security:\n  * Low. Stack overflow in ares_set_sortlist() which is used\n    during c-ares initialization and typically provided by an\n    administrator and not an end user.\n    (bsc#1208067, CVE-2022-4904)\n  Changes:\n  * Add ARES_OPT_HOSTS_FILE similar to ARES_OPT_RESOLVCONF for\n    specifying a custom hosts file location.\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Fix memory leak in reading /etc/hosts when using localhost\n    fallback.\n  * Fix chain building c-ares when libresolv is already included by\n    another project.\n  * File lookup should not immediately abort as there may be other\n    tries due to search criteria.\n  * Asterisks should be allowed in host validation as CNAMEs may\n    reference wildcard domains.\n  * AutoTools build system referenced bad STDC_HEADERS macro.\n  * Even if one address class returns a failure for\n    ares_getaddrinfo() we should still return the results we have.\n  * Fix ares_getaddrinfo() numerical address resolution with\n    AF_UNSPEC\n  * Fix tools and help information.\n  * Various documentation fixes and cleanups.\n  * Add include guards to ares_data.h\n  * c-ares could try to exceed maximum number of iovec entries\n    supported by system.\n  * The RFC6761 6.3 states localhost subdomains must be offline too\n- update to 1.18.1. Changes since 1.17.2:\n  * Allow '/' as a valid character for a returned name for\n    CNAME in-addr.arpa delegation\n  * no longer forwards requests for localhost resolution per RFC6761\n  * During a domain search, treat ARES_ENODATA as ARES_NXDOMAIN so\n    that the search process will continue to the next domain\n    in the search.\n  * Provide ares_nameser.h as a public interface as needed by NodeJS\n  * Add support for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) records via\n    ares_parse_uri_reply()\n- disable unit tests for SLE12 since GCC compiler too old to build\n  unit tests\n- 5c995d5.patch: upstreamed\n- disable-live-tests.patch: refreshed\n- new upstream website\n- drop multibuild - tests do not require static library anymore\n- spec file cleanup\n- drop sources that were re-added to upstream distibution\n  (c-ares-config.cmake.in ares_dns.h libcares.pc.cmake)\n- update to 1.17.2:\n  Security:\n  * When building c-ares with CMake, the RANDOM_FILE would not be set\n    and therefore downgrade to the less secure random number generator\n    it would cause a crash\n  * Expand number of escaped characters in DNS replies as per\n    RFC1035 5.1 to prevent spoofing follow-up\n    (bsc#1188881, CVE-2021-3672)\n  * Perform validation on hostnames to prevent possible XSS\n    due to applications not performing valiation themselves\n  Changes:\n  * ares_malloc(0) is now defined behavior (returns NULL) rather than system-specific to catch edge cases\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Building tests should not force building of static libraries except on Windows\n  * Relative headers must use double quotes to prevent pulling in a system library\n  for details see,\n  https://c-ares.haxx.se/changelog.html#1_17_2\n- update to 1.17.1:\n    Travis: add iOS target built with CMake (#378)\n    Issue #377 suggested that CMake builds for iOS with c-ares were broken. This PR adds an automatic Travis build for iOS CMake.\n  - fix build\n    External projects were using non-public header ares_dns.h, make public again (#376)\n    It appears some outside projects were relying on macros in ares_dns.h, even\n    though it doesn't appear that header was ever meant to be public.

To remove a PTF \u0026quot;/zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot;/ or a dedicated \u0026quot;/zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot;/ should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage log4j was updated:\n\n- Do not package the *.zip artifacts whose content is part of the  multi-release jars already\n- Added patch:\n  * log4j-java8compat.patch\n    + maintain ByteBuffer and CharBuffer compatibility with java 8\n- Build as multi-release jar.\n- Add some logging providers which we can build with the existing\n  dependencies and without cycles.\n- Add dependency on standalone javax.activation-api that is not\n  included in newer JDKs\n- Update to 2.17.2\n  * New Features\n  - Limit loading of configuration via a url to https by default.\n  - Require log4j2.Script.enableLanguages to be specified to\n    enable scripting for specific languages.\n  - Add TB support to FileSize.\n  - Add the log4j-to-jul JDK Logging Bridge.\n  - Add org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.AsyncAppender.getAppenders()\n    to more easily port from org.apache.log4j.AsyncAppender.getAllAppenders().\n  - Add Configurator.setLevel(Logger, Level),\n    setLevel(String, String), and setLevel(Class, Level).\n  - Add shorthand syntax for properties configuration format for\n    specifying a logger level and appender refs.\n  -

Modified such error messages,\n    to now contain the character ':' instead of '-' (since, the\n    character '-' can be confused with a negation symbol).\n    + The 'XML Schema 1.1 structures' REC in the section, \u0026quot;/3.2.3\n    Constraints on XML Representations of Attribute Declarations\n    (Schema Representation Constraint: Attribute Declaration\n    Representation)\u0026quot;/ mentions, '5 If fixed and use are both\n    present, use must not have the actual value prohibited'.\n    This functionality is newly introduced in XML Schema 1.1.\n    Fixed a runtime validation issue for this XSD clause, when\n    XSD 1.1 implementation is invoked in XSD 1.0 mode.\n    + Xerces-J was previously not building from sources when Java\n    9+ was used.\n    + XML Schema 1.1 has introduced the attribute 'ref' on xs:key,\n    xs:unique and xs:keyref. When certain suchschema documents\n    were processed by Xerces-J's XSD 1.1 implementation in XSD\n    1.0 mode, a java.lang.NullPointerException was displayed to\n    the user when the schema document is processed with Xerces\n    sample jaxp.SourceValidator.\n    + Fixed minor bugs and made various improvements.\n    + Added many new tests to the regression since the previous\n    Xerces release, for Xerces's XML Schema 1.0 and 1.1\n    implementations.\n\nPackage xml-commons-apis was updated:\n\nPackage xml-commons-resolver was updated:\n\nPackage xpp2 was updated:\n\n- Modified patch:  * xpp2-build_xml.patch\n    + Build with source/target levels 8\n- Added pom file\n\nPackage xpp3 was updated:\n\n- Modified patch:  * xpp3-sourcetarget.patch\n    + Build with source/target levels 8\n\nPackage xstream was updated:\n\n- Build against the standalone JavaEE modules unconditionally- Build against standalone activation-api and jaxb-api on systems\n  where the JavaEE modules are not part of JDK\n\nPackage yast2-network was updated:\n\n- Fix the return of packages needed by the selected backend when  running an autoinstallation (bsc#1207221)\n- 4.4.55\n- Do not crash when the NETMASK or PREFIXLEN are invalid\n  (bsc#1206551).\n- 4.4.54\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.7.- Provide \u0026quot;/removeptf\u0026quot;/ command (bsc#1203249)\n  A remove command which prefers replacing dependant packages to\n  removing them as well.\n  A PTF is typically removed as soon as the fix it provides is\n  applied to the latest official update of the dependant packages.\n  But you don't want the dependant packages to be removed together\n  with the PTF, which is what the remove command would do.

      "Description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code.

This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n",

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.",
