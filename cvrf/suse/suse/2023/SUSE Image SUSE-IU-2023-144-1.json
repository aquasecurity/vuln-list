      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-sap-15-sp4-hardened-byos-v20230219-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage SAPHanaSR was updated:\n\n- Version bump to 0.162.1  * fix for SAPHanaTopology failing with error code 1\n    (OCF_ERR_GENERIC) during a normal stop action\n    (bsc#1207466)\n  * set srhook attribute to PRIM during a probe so that we do not\n    need to wait for the first srConnectionChanged() to set the\n    attribute\n    (bsc#1205535)\n- Version bump to 0.162.0\n  * add improvements from SAP to the RA scripts regarding the\n    handling of the SAP tools 'HDB version', 'HDBSettings.sh' and\n    'pycd' and the SAPHana log filter handling\n    (jsc#PED-1739, jsc#PED-2608)\n  * fix for SAPHanaSR-monitor reporting \u0026quot;/LPA status of one node is\n    missing\u0026quot;/\n    (bsc#1192963, bsc#1203973)\n  * SAPHanaSRTools.pm: shows terminate node attribute too\n- remove patch:\n    0001-bsc-1192963.patch\n\nPackage audit-secondary was updated:\n\nPackage autoyast2 was updated:\n\n- Add needed packages for kdump even when kdump section is not  defined if product enable kdump by default (bsc#1204180)\n- 4.4.43\n- Add support for security policies validation (jsc#SLE-24764).\n- 4.4.42\n- Allow empty values in ask/default, ask/selection/label and\n  ask/selection/value elements (bsc#1204448).\n- 4.4.41\n- Add needed packages for the selected network backend in order to\n  prevent it is not declared in the software section (bsc#1201235,\n  bsc#1201435)\n- 4.4.40\n\nPackage bash-completion was updated:\n\n- Add patch fix-curl-help-completion-bsc1200791.patch (bsc#1200791)  * List all options for `curl --\u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt;`\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update to release 9.16.37  Security Fixes:\n  * An UPDATE message flood could cause named to exhaust all\n    available memory. This flaw was addressed by adding a new\n    update-quota option that controls the maximum number of\n    outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that named can hold in a queue\n    at any given time (default: 100). (CVE-2022-3094)\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG query\n    was received and stale-answer-client-timeout was set to a\n    non-zero value. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3736)\n  * named running as a resolver with the\n    stale-answer-client-timeout option set to any value greater\n    than 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when the\n    recursive-clients soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.\n    (CVE-2022-3924)\n  New Features:\n  * The new update-quota option can be used to control the number\n    of simultaneous DNS UPDATE messages that can be processed to\n    update an authoritative zone on a primary server, or forwarded\n    to the primary server by a secondary server. The default is\n    100. A new statistics counter has also been added to record\n    events when this quota is exceeded, and the version numbers for\n    the XML and JSON statistics schemas have been updated.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) feature in BIND\n    has been deprecated. Configuring DSCP values in named.conf now\n    causes a warning to be logged. Note that this feature has only\n    been partly operational since the new Network Manager was\n    introduced in BIND 9.16.0.\n  * The catalog zone implementation has been optimized to work with\n    hundreds of thousands of member zones.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * In certain query resolution scenarios (e.g. when following\n    CNAME records), named configured to answer from stale cache\n    could return a SERVFAIL response despite a usable, non-stale\n    answer being present in the cache. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1207471, bsc#1207473, bsc#1207475, jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.36\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The auto-dnssec option has been deprecated and will be removed\n    in a future BIND 9.19.x release. Please migrate to\n    dnssec-policy.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When a catalog zone was removed from the configuration, in some\n    cases a dangling pointer could cause the named process to\n    crash.\n  * When a zone was deleted from a server, a key management object\n    related to that zone was inadvertently kept in memory and only\n    released upon shutdown. This could lead to constantly\n    increasing memory use on servers with a high rate of changes\n    affecting the set of zones being served.\n  * In certain cases, named waited for the resolution of\n    outstanding recursive queries to finish before shutting down.\n  * The zone \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;class\u0026gt;: final reference detached log message\n    was moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to\n    prevent the named-checkzone tool from superfluously logging\n    this message in non-debug mode.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.35\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * A crash was fixed that happened when a dnssec-policy zone that\n    used NSEC3 was reconfigured to enable inline-signing.\n  * In certain resolution scenarios, quotas could be erroneously\n    reached for servers, including any configured forwarders,\n    resulting in SERVFAIL answers being sent to clients.\n  * rpz-ip rules in response-policy zones could be ineffective in\n    some cases if a query had the CD (Checking Disabled) bit set to\n    1.\n  * Previously, if Internet connectivity issues were experienced\n    during the initial startup of named, a BIND resolver with\n    dnssec-validation set to auto could enter into a state where it\n    would not recover without stopping named, manually deleting the\n    managed-keys.bind and managed-keys.bind.jnl files, and starting\n    named again.\n  * The statistics counter representing the current number of\n    clients awaiting recursive resolution results (RecursClients)\n    could overflow in certain resolution scenarios.\n  * Previously, BIND failed to start on Solaris-based systems with\n    hundreds of CPUs.\n  * When a DNS resource recordâs TTL value was equal to the\n    resolverâs configured prefetch âeligibilityâ value, the record\n    was erroneously not treated as eligible for prefetching.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.34\n  New Features:\n  * Support for parsing and validating the dohpath service\n    parameter in SVCB records was added.\n  * named now logs the supported cryptographic algorithms during\n    startup and in the output of named -V.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Changing just the TSIG key names for primaries in catalog\n    zonesâ member zones was not effective. This has been fixed.\n  Known Issues:\n  * Upgrading from BIND 9.16.32 or any older version may require a\n    manual configuration change. The following configurations are\n    affected:\n  - type primary zones configured with dnssec-policy but without\n    either allow-update or update-policy,\n  - type secondary zones configured with dnssec-policy.\n    In these cases please add inline-signing yes; to the individual\n    zone configuration(s). Without applying this change, named will\n    fail to start. For more details, see\n    https://kb.isc.org/docs/dnssec-policy-requires-dynamic-dns-or-inline-signing\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-maxpagesize.diff for a problem on old code  streams, where we would generate too large binaries.\n- s390-pic-dso.diff: use %pB instead of %B\n- SLE toolchain update of binutils.  Update to 2.39 from 2.37,\n  which means obsoleting and hence removing these patches:\n  binutils-add-efi-aarch64-1.diff, binutils-add-efi-aarch64-2.diff,\n  binutils-add-efi-aarch64-3.diff, binutils-fix-keepdebug.diff,\n  binutils-add-z16-name.diff.\n  Implements [jsc#SLE-25046, jsc#PED-2029, jsc#PED-2035, jsc#PED-2033,\n  jsc#PED-2030, jsc#PED-2038, jsc#PED-2032, jsc#PED-2034, jsc#PED-2031,\n  jsc#SLE-25047]\n- This fixes these CVEs relative to 2.37:\n  [bsc#1188374, bsc#1185597] aka (GCC) PR99935 aka CVE-2021-3648\n  [bsc#1193929] aka PR28694 aka CVE-2021-45078\n  [bsc#1194783] aka (GCC) PR98886 aka CVE-2021-46195\n  [bsc#1197592] aka (GCC) PR105039 aka CVE-2022-27943\n  [bsc#1202966] aka PR29289 aka CVE-2022-38126\n  [bsc#1202967] aka PR29290 aka CVE-2022-38127\n  [bsc#1202969] aka CVE-2021-3826\n- Add binutils-pr29482.diff for PR29482, aka CVE-2022-38533\n  [bsc#1202816]\n- Rebase binutils-2.39-branch.diff.gz that contains fix for PR29451.\n- Add binutils-2.39-branch.diff.gz.\n- Explicitly enable --enable-warn-execstack=yes and\t--enable-warn-rwx-segments=yes.\n- Add gprofng subpackage.\n- Update to binutils 2.39:\n  * The ELF linker will now generate a warning message if the stack is made\n    executable.  Similarly it will warn if the output binary contains a\n    segment with all three of the read, write and execute permission\n    bits set.  These warnings are intended to help developers identify\n    programs which might be vulnerable to attack via these executable\n    memory regions.\n    The warnings are enabled by default but can be disabled via a command\n    line option.  It is also possible to build a linker with the warnings\n    disabled, should that be necessary.\n  * The ELF linker now supports a --package-metadata option that allows\n    embedding a JSON payload in accordance to the Package Metadata\n    specification.\n  * In linker scripts it is now possible to use TYPE=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; in an output\n    section description to set the section type value.\n  * The objdump program now supports coloured/colored syntax\n    highlighting of its disassembler output for some architectures.\n    (Currently: AVR, RiscV, s390, x86, x86_64).\n  * The nm program now supports a --no-weak/-W option to make it ignore\n    weak symbols.\n  * The readelf and objdump programs now support a -wE option to prevent\n    them from attempting to access debuginfod servers when following\n    links.\n  * The objcopy program's --weaken, --weaken-symbol, and\n  - -weaken-symbols options now works with unique symbols as well.\n- Rebase binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff, binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff,\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff and remove binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz.\n- For now use --disable-gprofng.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1142579 aka CVE-2019-1010204 aka PR23765\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n- Use https for variosu links.\n- Update binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz (to 93054037f1e304e)\n  in order to include PR29087.\n- Enable multitarget build on riscv64\n- On SLE15 and later, use make -Oline to synchronize configure output by\n  lines\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n- Renumber Sources.\n- Fix ExcludeArch for ppc.\n- Make multibuild utilize only the main binutils.spec file.\n- Remove not needed README.First-for.SUSE.packagers, pre_checkin.sh.\n- Start using _multibuild for cross binutils.\n  (forward port from SLE)\n- Update binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz (to c210342d7f5) to include\n  recognition of 'z16' name for 'arch14' on s390.  [bsc#1198237]\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n- Add usage of a SUSE_ZNOW environment variable which allows switching\n  on \u0026quot;/-z now\u0026quot;/ by default using \u0026quot;/export SUSE_ZNOW=1\u0026quot;/, similar to\n  the SUSE_ASNEEDED variable.  Adds binutils-znow.patch.\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch: add back fix for boo#1191473,\n  which got lost in the update to 2.38.\n- Update binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz in order to include PR28879.\n- From Stefan BrÃ¼ns \u0026lt;stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de\u0026gt;:\n  * Install symlinks for all target specific tools on\n    arm-eabi-none [bsc#1185712]\n- Do not re-generate ld/ldlex.c, ld/ldgram.c, ld/ldgram.h and verify\n  that corresponding flex/bison files are not modified by a patch.\n- Use verbose mode for make for cross compilers.\n- Make it build on SLE-11 again.\n- Use verbose mode for make.\n- Update to binutils 2.38:\n  * elfedit: Add --output-abiversion option to update ABIVERSION.\n  * Add support for the LoongArch instruction set.\n  * Tools which display symbols or strings (readelf, strings, nm, objdump)\n    have a new command line option which controls how unicode characters are\n    handled.  By default they are treated as normal for the tool.  Using\n  - -unicode=locale will display them according to the current locale.\n    Using --unicode=hex will display them as hex byte values, whilst\n  - -unicode=escape will display them as escape sequences.  In addition\n    using --unicode=highlight will display them as unicode escape sequences\n    highlighted in red (if supported by the output device).\n  * readelf -r dumps RELR relative relocations now.\n  * Support for efi-app-aarch64, efi-rtdrv-aarch64 and efi-bsdrv-aarch64 has been\n    added to objcopy in order to enable UEFI development using binutils.\n  * ar: Add --thin for creating thin archives. -T is a deprecated alias without\n    diagnostics. In many ar implementations -T has a different meaning, as\n    specified by X/Open System Interface.\n  * Add support for AArch64 system registers that were missing in previous\n    releases.\n  * Add support for the LoongArch instruction set.\n  * Add a command-line option, -muse-unaligned-vector-move, for x86 target\n    to encode aligned vector move as unaligned vector move.\n  * Add support for Cortex-R52+ for Arm.\n  * Add support for Cortex-A510, Cortex-A710, Cortex-X2 for AArch64.\n  * Add support for Cortex-A710 for Arm.\n  * Add support for Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) for AArch64.\n  * The --multibyte-handling=[allow|warn|warn-sym-only] option tells the\n    assembler what to when it encoutners multibyte characters in the input.  The\n    default is to allow them.  Setting the option to \u0026quot;/warn\u0026quot;/ will generate a\n    warning message whenever any multibyte character is encountered.  Using the\n    option to \u0026quot;/warn-sym-only\u0026quot;/ will make the assembler generate a warning whenever a\n    symbol is defined containing multibyte characters.  (References to undefined\n    symbols will not generate warnings).\n  * Outputs of .ds.x directive and .tfloat directive with hex input from\n    x86 assembler have been reduced from 12 bytes to 10 bytes to match the\n    output of .tfloat directive.\n  * Add support for 'armv8.8-a', 'armv9-a', 'armv9.1-a', 'armv9.2-a' and\n    'armv9.3-a' for -march in AArch64 GAS.\n  * Add support for 'armv8.7-a', 'armv8.8-a', 'armv9-a', 'armv9.1-a',\n    'armv9.2-a' and 'armv9.3-a' for -march in Arm GAS.\n  * Add support for Intel AVX512_FP16 instructions.\n  * Add -z pack-relative-relocs/-z no pack-relative-relocs to x86 ELF\n    linker to pack relative relocations in the DT_RELR section.\n  * Add support for the LoongArch architecture.\n  * Add -z indirect-extern-access/-z noindirect-extern-access to x86 ELF\n    linker to control canonical function pointers and copy relocation.\n  * Add --max-cache-size=SIZE to set the the maximum cache size to SIZE\n    bytes.\n- Add binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz.\n- Removed deletion of man pages as they should be properly packages\n  in tarball.\n- Rebased patches: aarch64-common-pagesize.patch, add-ulp-section.diff,\n  binutils-bfd_h.patch, binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff,\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff, binutils-skip-rpaths.patch\n  and binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff.\n- Enable PRU architecture for AM335x CPU (Beagle Bone Black board)\n- use fdupes on datadir\n- remove RPM_BUILD_ROOT usage and other cleanups\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28494.\n\nPackage ca-certificates-mozilla was updated:\n\n- Updated to 2.60 state of Mozilla SSL root CAs (bsc#1206622)  Removed CAs:\n  - Global Chambersign Root\n  - EC-ACC\n  - Network Solutions Certificate Authority\n  - Staat der Nederlanden EV Root CA\n  - SwissSign Platinum CA - G2\n  Added CAs:\n  - DIGITALSIGN GLOBAL ROOT ECDSA CA\n  - DIGITALSIGN GLOBAL ROOT RSA CA\n  - Security Communication ECC RootCA1\n  - Security Communication RootCA3\n  Changed trust:\n  - TrustCor certificates only trusted up to Nov 30 (bsc#1206212)\n- Removed CAs (bsc#1206212) as most code does not handle \u0026quot;/valid before nov 30 2022\u0026quot;/\n  and it is not clear how many certs were issued for SSL middleware by TrustCor:\n  - TrustCor RootCert CA-1\n  - TrustCor RootCert CA-2\n  - TrustCor ECA-1\n  Patch: remove-trustcor.patch\n\nPackage catatonit was updated:\n\n- Update to catatont v0.1.7- This release adds the ability for catatonit to be used as the only\n  process in a pause container, by passing the -P flag (in this mode no\n  subprocess is spawned and thus no signal forwarding is done).\n- Add 99bb9048f.patch: configure.ac: call AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE only\n  once. Fix build with autocnf 2.71 / automake 1.16.5.\n- Update to catatonit v0.1.6, which fixes a few bugs -- mainly ones related to\n  socket activation or features somewhat adjacent to socket activation (such as\n  passing file descriptors).\n- Update catatonit-rpmlintrc in order to cover that static binaries are now an\n  error not a warning.\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update to version 10.0.8 (bsc#1206428)  - Fix regression introduced by 10.0.7. When the hosts file was modified\n    such that there is no empty line at the end of the file the content\n    after removing the registration data does not match the content prior\n    to registration.

      "Description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.

If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.",

Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.",
