      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp4-sapcal-v20230621-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage Mesa was updated:\n\n- U_ReturnME.patch  * fixes blackscreen in Return To Monkey Island on Intel graphics\n    (boo#1208145)\n\nPackage Mesa-drivers was updated:\n\n- U_ReturnME.patch  * fixes blackscreen in Return To Monkey Island on Intel graphics\n    (boo#1208145)\n\nPackage apache2 was updated:\n\n- Security update:  * fix CVE-2023-27522 [bsc#1209049], mod_proxy_uwsgi HTTP response splitting\n    + Added patch apache2-CVE-2023-27522.patch\n  * fix CVE-2023-25690 [bsc#1209047], HTTP request splitting with mod_rewrite and mod_proxy\n    + Added patch apache2-CVE-2023-25690.patch\n- Rename patches to use proper naming:\n  * Rename patch:\n  - Removed bsc1207327-fix-mod_proxy-handling-long-urls.patch\n  - Added apache2-bsc1207327-fix-mod_proxy-handling-long-urls.patch\n- [bsc#1208708] fix passing health check does not recover worker\n  from its error state:\n  * Added: apache2-bsc1208708-fix-passing-health-check-recover-worker-from-error-state.patch\n- [bsc#1207327] fix mod_proxy handling of very long urls\n  + bsc1207327-fix-mod_proxy-handling-long-urls.patch\n- security update\n- added patches:\n  fix CVE-2022-37436 [bsc#1207251], mod_proxy backend HTTP response splitting\n  + apache2-CVE-2022-37436.patch\n  fix CVE-2022-36760 [bsc#1207250], mod_proxy_ajp Possible request smuggling\n  + apache2-CVE-2022-36760.patch\n  fix CVE-2006-20001 [bsc#1207247], mod_dav out of bounds read, or write of zero byte\n  + apache2-CVE-2006-20001.patch\n\nPackage apr-util was updated:\n\n- security fix CVE-2022-25147, bsc#1207866: buffer overflow  possible with specially crafted input\n  + added patch apr-util-CVE-2022-25147.patch\n\nPackage autofs was updated:\n\n- autofs-5.1.3-revert-fix-argc-off-by-one-in-mount_aut.patch  Fix off-by-one error in recursive map handling. (bsc#1209653)\n\nPackage autoyast2 was updated:\n\n- Rebuild the RPM database during upgrade (--rebuilddb) (bsc#1209565)- 4.4.45\n- Properly install the selected products, do not lose them after\n  resetting the package manager internally (bsc#1202234)\n- 4.4.44\n\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Add avahi-CVE-2023-1981.patch: emit error if requested service  is not found (boo#1210328 CVE-2023-1981).\n- switch to use _multibuild\n- delete _avahi_spec-prepare.sh, pre_checkin.sh: obsolete\n- use https urls\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update to release 9.16.38  Bug Fixes:\n  * A constant stream of zone additions and deletions via rndc\n    reconfig could cause increased memory consumption due to\n    delayed cleaning of view memory. This has been fixed.\n  * The speed of the message digest algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2),\n    and of NSEC3 hashing, has been improved.\n  * Building BIND 9 failed when the --enable-dnsrps switch for\n    ./configure was used. This has been fixed.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Updated keyring and signature\n- Update to release 9.16.37\n  Security Fixes:\n  * An UPDATE message flood could cause named to exhaust all\n    available memory. This flaw was addressed by adding a new\n    update-quota option that controls the maximum number of\n    outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that named can hold in a queue\n    at any given time (default: 100). (CVE-2022-3094)\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG query\n    was received and stale-answer-client-timeout was set to a\n    non-zero value. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3736)\n  * named running as a resolver with the\n    stale-answer-client-timeout option set to any value greater\n    than 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when the\n    recursive-clients soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.\n    (CVE-2022-3924)\n  New Features:\n  * The new update-quota option can be used to control the number\n    of simultaneous DNS UPDATE messages that can be processed to\n    update an authoritative zone on a primary server, or forwarded\n    to the primary server by a secondary server. The default is\n    100. A new statistics counter has also been added to record\n    events when this quota is exceeded, and the version numbers for\n    the XML and JSON statistics schemas have been updated.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) feature in BIND\n    has been deprecated. Configuring DSCP values in named.conf now\n    causes a warning to be logged. Note that this feature has only\n    been partly operational since the new Network Manager was\n    introduced in BIND 9.16.0.\n  * The catalog zone implementation has been optimized to work with\n    hundreds of thousands of member zones.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * In certain query resolution scenarios (e.g. when following\n    CNAME records), named configured to answer from stale cache\n    could return a SERVFAIL response despite a usable, non-stale\n    answer being present in the cache. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1207471, bsc#1207473, bsc#1207475, jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.36\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The auto-dnssec option has been deprecated and will be removed\n    in a future BIND 9.19.x release. Please migrate to\n    dnssec-policy.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When a catalog zone was removed from the configuration, in some\n    cases a dangling pointer could cause the named process to\n    crash.\n  * When a zone was deleted from a server, a key management object\n    related to that zone was inadvertently kept in memory and only\n    released upon shutdown. This could lead to constantly\n    increasing memory use on servers with a high rate of changes\n    affecting the set of zones being served.\n  * In certain cases, named waited for the resolution of\n    outstanding recursive queries to finish before shutting down.\n  * The zone \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;class\u0026gt;: final reference detached log message\n    was moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to\n    prevent the named-checkzone tool from superfluously logging\n    this message in non-debug mode.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage c-ares was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.19.1  Security:\n  * CVE-2023-32067. High. 0-byte UDP payload causes Denial of Service\n    (bsc#1211604)\n  * CVE-2023-31147 Moderate. Insufficient randomness in generation\n    of DNS query IDs (bsc#1211605)\n  * CVE-2023-31130. Moderate. Buffer Underwrite in\n    ares_inet_net_pton() (bsc#1211606)\n  * CVE-2023-31124. Low.

Stack overflow in ares_set_sortlist() which is used\n    during c-ares initialization and typically provided by an\n    administrator and not an end user.\n    (bsc#1208067, CVE-2022-4904)\n  Changes:\n  * Add ARES_OPT_HOSTS_FILE similar to ARES_OPT_RESOLVCONF for\n    specifying a custom hosts file location.\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Fix memory leak in reading /etc/hosts when using localhost\n    fallback.\n  * Fix chain building c-ares when libresolv is already included by\n    another project.\n  * File lookup should not immediately abort as there may be other\n    tries due to search criteria.\n  * Asterisks should be allowed in host validation as CNAMEs may\n    reference wildcard domains.\n  * AutoTools build system referenced bad STDC_HEADERS macro.\n  * Even if one address class returns a failure for\n    ares_getaddrinfo() we should still return the results we have.\n  * Fix ares_getaddrinfo() numerical address resolution with\n    AF_UNSPEC\n  * Fix tools and help information.\n  * Various documentation fixes and cleanups.\n  * Add include guards to ares_data.h\n  * c-ares could try to exceed maximum number of iovec entries\n    supported by system.\n  * The RFC6761 6.3 states localhost subdomains must be offline too\n- update to 1.18.1. Changes since 1.17.2:\n  * Allow '/' as a valid character for a returned name for\n    CNAME in-addr.arpa delegation\n  * no longer forwards requests for localhost resolution per RFC6761\n  * During a domain search, treat ARES_ENODATA as ARES_NXDOMAIN so\n    that the search process will continue to the next domain\n    in the search.\n  * Provide ares_nameser.h as a public interface as needed by NodeJS\n  * Add support for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) records via\n    ares_parse_uri_reply()\n- disable unit tests for SLE12 since GCC compiler too old to build\n  unit tests\n- 5c995d5.patch: upstreamed\n- disable-live-tests.patch: refreshed\n- new upstream website\n- drop multibuild - tests do not require static library anymore\n- spec file cleanup\n- drop sources that were re-added to upstream distibution\n  (c-ares-config.cmake.in ares_dns.h libcares.pc.cmake)\n- update to 1.17.2:\n  Security:\n  * When building c-ares with CMake, the RANDOM_FILE would not be set\n    and therefore downgrade to the less secure random number generator\n    it would cause a crash\n  * Expand number of escaped characters in DNS replies as per\n    RFC1035 5.1 to prevent spoofing follow-up\n    (bsc#1188881, CVE-2021-3672)\n  * Perform validation on hostnames to prevent possible XSS\n    due to applications not performing valiation themselves\n  Changes:\n  * ares_malloc(0) is now defined behavior (returns NULL) rather than system-specific to catch edge cases\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Building tests should not force building of static libraries except on Windows\n  * Relative headers must use double quotes to prevent pulling in a system library\n  for details see,\n  https://c-ares.haxx.se/changelog.html#1_17_2\n- update to 1.17.1:\n    Travis: add iOS target built with CMake (#378)\n    Issue #377 suggested that CMake builds for iOS with c-ares were broken. This PR adds an automatic Travis build for iOS CMake.\n  - fix build\n    External projects were using non-public header ares_dns.h, make public again (#376)\n    It appears some outside projects were relying on macros in ares_dns.h, even\n    though it doesn't appear that header was ever meant to be public.  That said,\n    we don't want to break external integrators so we should distribute this header\n    again.\n  - note that so versioning has moved to configure.ac\n  - note about 1.17.1\n  - fix sed gone wrong\n    autotools cleanup (#372)\n  * buildconf: remove custom logic with autoreconf\n- remove missing_header.patch (upstream)\n\nPackage cloud-netconfig was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.7:  + Overhaul policy routing setup (issue #19)\n  + Support alias IPv4 ranges (issue #14)\n  + Add support for NetworkManager (bsc#1204549)\n  + Remove dependency on netconfig\n  + Install into libexec directory\n  + Clear stale ifcfg files for accelerated NICs (bsc#1199853)\n  + More debug messages\n  + Documentation update\n- /etc/netconfig.d/ moved to /usr/libexec/netconfig/netconfig.d/ in\n  Tumbleweed, update path (poo#116221)\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update to version 10.1.2 (bsc#1211282)  + Properly handle Ipv6 when checking update server responsiveness.

Curl's 7.86.0 release introduces the use of\n  nghttp2_option_set_no_rfc9113_leading_and_trailing_ws_validation,\n  introduced by nghttp2 1.50.0 release, without introducing a check\n  for the function/right version in their build scripts. This will\n  make Zypper/cURL unusable in some corner cases where users\n  installing something that requires libcurl4 before doing full\n  system upgrade, thus updating the cURL stack, but not\n  libnghttp2's.

It is used for determining if\n  there should be two kernel sources built as well as for the purpose of\n  determmioning if vanilla kernel should be used for kernel-obs-build.\n  While the former can be determined at build time the latter needs to be\n  baked into the spec file template. Separate the two while also making\n  the latter more generic.\n  $build_dtbs is enabled on every single rt and azure branch since 15.3\n  when the setting was introduced, gate on the new $obs_build_variant\n  setting as well.\n- commit 36ba909\n- USB: fotg210: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 632f169\n- Refresh\n

This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage makedumpfile was updated:\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1208999) with  fixes to PBKDF2 parameter validation.\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1208999) to\n  validate extra PBKDF2 parameters according to FIPS 140-3.\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1191546) to\n  update session-\u0026gt;lastOpWasFIPS before destroying the key after\n  derivation in the CKM_TLS12_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE,\n  CKM_NSS_TLS_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE_SHA256,\n  CKM_TLS_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE and CKM_SSL3_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE cases.\n- Update nss-fips-pct-pubkeys.patch (bsc#1207209) to remove some\n  excess code.\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1191546).\n- Add nss-fips-pct-pubkeys.patch (bsc#1207209) for pairwise consistency\n  checks.

When submit request on IBS for updating SLE shim, the submitreq\n  project be generated, but it always be blocked by checking the signature\n  of openSUSE shim.\n  It doesn't make sense checking openSUSE shim signature when building\n  SLE shim on SLE platform, and vice versa. So the following change adds the\n  logic to compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse).\n  When and only when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop\n  building.\n    [#] compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse)\n    [#] when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop building\n- Upgrade shim-install for bsc#1210382\n  After closing Leap-gap project since Leap 15.3, openSUSE Leap direct\n  uses shim from SLE. So the ca_string is 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure Boot\n  CA1', not 'openSUSE Secure Boot CA1'. It causes that the update_boot=no,\n  so all files in /boot/efi/EFI/boot are not updated.\n  The 86b73d1 patch added the logic that using ID field in os-release for\n  checking Leap distro and set ca_string to 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure\n  Boot CA1'. Then /boot/efi/EFI/boot/* can also be updated.\n- https://github.com/SUSE/shim-resources (git log --oneline)\n  86b73d1 Fix that bootx64.efi is not updated on Leap\n  f2e8143 Use the long name to specify the grub2 key protector\n  7283012 cryptodisk: support TPM authorized policies\n  49e7a0d Do not use tpm_record_pcrs unless the command is in command.lst\n  26c6bd5 Have grub take a snapshot of \u0026quot;/relevant\u0026quot;/ TPM PCRs\n  5c2c3ad Handle different cases of controlling cryptomount volumes during first stage boot\n  a5c5734 Introduce --no-grub-install option\n- Updated shim signature after shim 15.7 be signed back:\n  signature-sles.x86_64.asc, signature-sles.aarch64.asc (bsc#1198458, CVE-2022-28737)\n- Add POST_PROCESS_PE_FLAGS=-N to the build command in shim.spec to\n  disable the NX compatibility flag when using post-process-pe because\n  grub2 is not ready.

      "Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers.",

We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited.\n\nMemory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes.\n\nIf a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome.\n\nBIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

      "Description": "A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl \u003c 7.84.0 stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests that become larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sending crazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error.This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match for `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a \"sister server\" to effectively cause a denial of service for a sibling site on the same second level domain using this method.",

In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration.

Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.",

To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS  or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP  has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.\n\nThere is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data  of a struct inet_connection_sock.\n\nWhen CONFIG_TLS  is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.\n\nThe setsockopt  TCP_ULP  operation does not require any privilege.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit  2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c",

We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.",

The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.
