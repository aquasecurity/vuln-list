      "Text": "This update for podman fixes the following issues:\n\npodman was updated to version 4.3.1:\n\n4.3.1:\n\n* Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed a deadlock between the `podman ps` and `podman container inspect` commands\n\n* Misc\n\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.23.1\n \n4.3.0:\n\n* Features\n\n- A new command, `podman generate spec`, has been added, which creates a JSON struct based on a given container that can be used with the Podman REST API to create containers.\n- A new command, `podman update`, has been added,which makes changes to the resource limits of existing containers. Please note that these changes do not persist if the container is restarted\n- A new command, `podman kube down`, has been added, which removes pods and containers created by the given Kubernetes YAML (functionality is identical to `podman kube play --down`, but it now has its own command).\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports Kubernetes secrets using Podman's secrets backend.\n- Systemd-managed pods created by the `podman kube play` command now integrate with sd-notify, using the `io.containers.sdnotify` annotation (or `io.containers.sdnotify/$name` for specific containers).\n- Systemd-managed pods created by `podman kube play` can now be auto-updated, using the `io.containers.auto-update` annotation (or `io.containers.auto-update/$name` for specific containers).\n- The `podman kube play` command can now read YAML from URLs, e.g. `podman kube play https://example.com/demo.yml`\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports the `emptyDir` volume type\n- The `podman kube play` command now supports the `HostUsers` field in the pod spec.\n- The `podman play kube` command now supports `binaryData` in ConfigMaps.\n- The `podman pod create` command can now set additional resource limits for pods using the new `--memory-swap`, `--cpuset-mems`, `--device-read-bps`, `--device-write-bps`, `--blkio-weight`, `--blkio-weight-device`, and `--cpu-shares` options.\n- The `podman machine init` command now supports a new option, `--username`, to set the username that will be used to connect to the VM as a non-root user\n- The `podman volume create` command's `-o timeout=` option can now set a timeout of 0, indicating volume plugin operations will never time out.\n- Added support for a new volume driver, `image`, which allows volumes to be created that are backed by images.\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option, `--env-merge`, allowing environment variables to be specified relative to other environment variables in the image (e.g. `podman run --env-merge 'PATH=$PATH:/my/app' ...`)\n- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands support a new option, `--on-failure`, to allow action to be taken when a container fails health checks, with the following supported actions: `none` (take no action, the default), `kill` (kill the container), `restart` (restart the container), and `stop` (stop the container).\n- The `--keep-id` option to `podman create` and `podman run` now supports new options, `uid` and `gid`, to set the UID and GID of the user in the container that will be mapped to the user running Podman (e.g. `--userns=keep-id:uid=11` will made the user running Podman to UID 11 in the container)\n- The `podman generate systemd` command now supports a new option, `--env`/`-e`, to set environment variables in the generated unit file\n- The `podman pause` and `podman unpause` commands now support the `--latest`, `--cidfile`, and `--filter` options.\n- The `podman restart` command now supports the `--cidfile` and `--filter` options.\n- The `podman rm` command now supports the `--filter` option to select which containers will be removed.\n- The `podman rmi` command now supports a new option, `--no-prune`, to prevent the removal of dangling parents of removed images.\n- The `--dns-opt` option to `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman pod create` has received a new alias, `--dns-option`, to improve Docker compatibility.\n- The `podman` command now features a new global flag, `--debug`/`-D`, which enables debug-level logging (identical to `--log-level=debug`), improving Docker compatibility.\n- The `podman` command now features a new global flag, `--config`. This flag is ignored, and is only included for Docker compatibility\n- The `podman manifest create` command now accepts a new option, `--amend`/`-a`.\n- The `podman manifest create`, `podman manifest add` and `podman manifest push` commands now accept a new option, `--insecure` (identical to `--tls-verify=false`), improving Docker compatibility.\n- The `podman secret create` command's `--driver` and `--format` options now have new aliases, `-d` for `--driver` and `-f` for `--format`.\n- The `podman secret create` command now supports a new option, `--label`/`-l`, to add labels to created secrets.\n- The `podman secret ls` command now accepts the `--quiet`/`-q` option.\n- The `podman secret inspect` command now accepts a new option, `--pretty`, to print output in human-readable format.\n- The `podman stats` command now accepts the `--no-trunc` option.\n- The `podman save` command now accepts the `--signature-policy` option\n- The `podman pod inspect` command now allows multiple arguments to be passed. If so, it will return a JSON array of the inspected pods\n- A series of new hidden commands have been added under `podman context` as aliases to existing `podman system connection` commands, to improve Docker compatibility.\n- The remote Podman client now supports proxying signals for attach sessions when the `--sig-proxy` option is set\n\n### Changes\n\n- Duplicate volume mounts are now allowed with the `-v` option to `podman run`, `podman create`, and `podman pod create`, so long as source, destination, and options all match\n- The `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube` commands have been renamed to `podman kube generate` and `podman kube play` to group Kubernetes-related commands. Aliases have been added to ensure the old command names still function.\n- A number of Podman commands (`podman init`, `podman container checkpoint`, `podman container restore`, `podman container cleanup`) now print the user-inputted name of the container, instead of its full ID, on success.\n- When an unsupported option (e.g. resource limit) is specified for a rootless container on a cgroups v1 system, a warning message is now printed that the limit will not be honored.\n- The installer for the Windows Podman client has been improved.\n- The `--cpu-rt-period` and `--cpu-rt-runtime` options to `podman run` and `podman create` now print a warning and are ignored on cgroups v2 systems (cgroups v2 having dropped support for these controllers)\n- Privileged containers running systemd will no longer mount `/dev/tty*` devices other than `/dev/tty` itself into the container\n- Events for containers that are part of a pod now include the ID of the pod in the event.\n- SSH functionality for `podman machine` commands has seen a thorough rework, addressing many issues about authentication.\n- The `--network` option to `podman kube play` now allows passing `host` to set the pod to use host networking, even if the YAML does not request this.\n- The `podman inspect` command on containers now includes the digest of the image used to create the container.\n- Pods created by `podman play kube` are now, by default, placed into a network named `podman-kube`. If the `podman-kube` network does not exist, it will be created. This ensures pods can connect to each other by their names, as the network has DNS enabled.\n\n\nUpdate to version 4.2.0:\n\n* Features\n\n- Podman now supports the Gitlab Runner (using the Docker executor), allowing its use in Gitlab CI/CD pipelines.\n- A new command has been added, podman pod clone, to create a copy of an existing pod. It supports several options, including --start to start the new pod, --destroy to remove the original pod, and --name to change the name of the new pod\n- A new command has been added, podman volume reload, to sync changes in state between Podman's database and any configured volume plugins\n- A new command has been added, podman machine info, which displays information about the host and the versions of various machine components.\n- Pods created by podman play kube can now be managed by systemd unit files. This can be done via a new systemd service, podman-kube@.service - e.g. systemctl --user start podman-play-kube@$(systemd-escape my.yaml).service will run the Kubernetes pod or deployment contained in my.yaml under systemd.\n- The podman play kube command now honors the RunAsUser, RunAsGroup, and SupplementalGroups setting from the Kubernetes pod's security context.\n- The podman play kube command now supports volumes with the BlockDevice and CharDevice types\n- The podman play kube command now features a new flag, --userns, to set the user namespace of created pods. Two values are allowed at present: host and auto\n- The podman play kube command now supports setting the type of created init containers via the io.podman.annotations.init.container.type annotation.\n- Pods now have include an exit policy (configurable via the --exit-policy option to podman pod create), which determines what will happen to the pod's infra container when the entire pod stops. The default, continue, acts as Podman currently does, while a new option, stop, stops the infra container after the last container in the pod stops, and is used by default for pods from podman play kube\n- The podman pod create command now allows the pod's name to be specified as an argument, instead of using the --name option - for example, podman pod create mypod instead of the prior podman pod create --name mypod. Please note that the --name option is not deprecated and will continue to work.\n- The podman pod create command's --share option now supports adding namespaces to the set by prefacing them with + (as opposed to specifying all namespaces that should be shared)\n- The podman pod create command has a new option, --shm-size, to specify the size of the /dev/shm mount that will be shared if the pod shares its UTS namespace (#14609).\n- The podman pod create command has a new option, --uts, to configure the UTS namespace that will be shared by containers in the pod.\n- The podman pod create command now supports setting pod-level resource limits via the --cpus, --cpuset-cpus, and --memory options. These will set a limit for all containers in the pod, while individual containers within the pod are allowed to set further limits. Look forward to more options for resource limits in our next release!\n- The podman create and podman run commands now include the -c short option for the --cpu-shares option.\n- The podman create and podman run commands can now create containers from a manifest list (and not an image) as long as the --platform option is specified (#14773).\n- The podman build command now supports a new option, --cpp-flag, to specify options for the C preprocessor when using Containerfile.in files that require preprocessing.\n- The podman build command now supports a new option, --build-context, allowing the user to specify an additional build context.\n- The podman machine inspect command now prints the location of the VM's Podman API socket on the host (#14231).\n- The podman machine init command on Windows now fetches an image with packages pre-installed (#14698).\n- Unused, cached Podman machine VM images are now cleaned up automatically. Note that because Podman now caches in a different directory, this will not clean up old images pulled before this change (#14697).\n- The default for the --image-volume option to podman run and podman create can now have its default set through the image_volume_mode setting in containers.conf (#14230).\n- Overlay volumes now support two new options, workdir and upperdir, to allow multiple overlay volumes from different containers to reuse the same workdir or upperdir (#14427).\n- The podman volume create command now supports two new options, copy and nocopy, to control whether contents from the overmounted folder in a container will be copied into the newly-created named volume (copy-up).\n- Volumes created using a volume plugin can now specify a timeout for all operations that contact the volume plugin (replacing the standard 5 second timeout) via the --opt o=timeout= option to podman volume create (BZ 2080458).\n- The podman volume ls command's --filter name= option now supports regular expression matching for volume names (#14583).\n- When used with a podman machine VM, volumes now support specification of the 9p security model using the security_model option to podman create -v and podman run -v.\n- The remote Podman client's podman push command now supports the --remove-signatures option (#14558).\n- The remote Podman client now supports the podman image scp command.\n- The podman image scp command now supports tagging the transferred image with a new name.\n- The podman network ls command supports a new filter, --filter dangling=, to list networks not presently used by any containers (#14595).\n- The --condition option to podman wait can now be specified multiple times to wait on any one of multiple conditions.\n- The podman events command now includes the -f short option for the --filter option.\n- The podman pull command now includes the -a short option for the --all-tags option.\n- The podman stop command now includes a new flag, --filter, to filter which containers will be stopped (e.g. podman stop --all --filter label=COM.MY.APP).\n- The Podman global option --url now has two aliases: -H and --host.\n- The podman network create command now supports a new option with the default bridge driver, --opt isolate=, which isolates the network by blocking any traffic from it to any other network with the isolate option enabled. This option is enabled by default for networks created using the Docker-compatible API.\n- Added the ability to create sigstore signatures in podman push and podman manifest push.\n- Added an option to read image signing passphrase from a file.\n\n* Changes\n\n- Paused containers can now be killed with the podman kill command.\n- The podman system prune command now removes unused networks.\n- The --userns=keep-id and --userns=nomap options to the podman run and podman create commands are no longer allowed (instead of simply being ignored) with root Podman.\n- If the /run directory for a container is part of a volume, Podman will not create the /run/.containerenv file (#14577).\n- The podman machine stop command on macOS now waits for the machine to be completely stopped to exit (#14148).\n- All podman machine commands now only support being run as rootless, given that VMs only functioned when run rootless.\n- The podman unpause --all command will now only attempt to unpause containers that are paused, not all containers.\n- Init containers created with podman play kube now default to the once type (#14877).\n- Pods created with no shared namespaces will no longer create an infra container unless one is explicitly requested (#15048).\n- The podman create, podman run, and podman cp commands can now autocomplete paths in the image or container via the shell completion.\n- The libpod/common package has been removed as it's not used anywhere.\n- The --userns option to podman create and podman run is no longer accepted when an explicit UID or GID mapping is specified (#15233).\n\n\n* Misc\n\n- Podman will now check for nameservers in /run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf if the /etc/resolv.conf file only contains a localhost server.\n- The podman build command now supports caching with builds that specify --squash-all by allowing the --layers flag to be used at the same time.\n- Podman Machine support for QEMU installations at non-default paths has been improved.\n- The podman machine ssh command no longer prints spurious warnings every time it is run.\n- When accessing the WSL prompt on Windows, the rootless user will be preferred.\n- The podman info command now includes a field for information on supported authentication plugins for improved Docker compatibility. Authentication plugins are not presently supported by Podman, so this field is always empty.\n- The podman system prune command now no longer prints the Deleted Images header if no images were pruned.\n- The podman system service command now automatically creates and moves to a sub-cgroup when running in the root cgroup (#14573).\n- Updated Buildah to v1.27.0 (fixes CVE-2022-21698 / bsc#1196338)\n- Updated the containers/image library to v5.22.0\n- Updated the containers/storage library to v1.42.0 (fixes bsc#1196751)\n- Updated the containers/common library to v0.49.1\n- Podman will automatically create a sub-cgroup and move itself into it when it detects that it is running inside a container (#14884).\n- Fixed an incorrect release note about regexp.\n- A new MacOS installer (via pkginstaller) is now supported.\n\nUpdate to version 4.1.1:\n\n* The output of the podman load command now mirrors that of docker load.\n* Podman now supports Docker Compose v2.2 and higher. Please note that it may be necessary to disable the use of Buildkit by setting the environment variable DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0.\n* A new container command has been added, podman container clone. This command makes a copy of an existing container, with the ability to change some settings (e.g. resource limits) while doing so.\n* Podman now supports sending JSON events related to machines to a Unix socket named machine_events.*\\.sock in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman or to a socket whose path is set in the PODMAN_MACHINE_EVENTS_SOCK environment variable.\n* Two new volume commands have been added, podman volume mount and podman volume unmount. These allow for Podman-managed named volumes to be mounted and accessed from outside containers.\n* The podman container checkpoint and podman container restore options now support checkpointing to and restoring from OCI images. This allows checkpoints to be distributed via standard image registries.\n* The podman play kube command now supports environment variables that are specified using the fieldRef and resourceFieldRef sources.\n* The podman play kube command will now set default resource limits when the provided YAML does not include them.\n* The podman play kube command now supports a new option, --annotation, to add annotations to created containers.\n* The podman play kube --build command now supports a new option, --context-dir, which allows the user to specify the context directory to use when building the Containerfile.\n* The podman container commit command now supports a new option, --squash, which squashes the generated image into a single layer.\n* The podman pod logs command now supports two new options, --names, which identifies which container generated a log message by name, instead of ID and --color, which colors messages based on what container generated them.\n* The podman rmi command now supports a new option, --ignore, which will ignore errors caused by missing images.\n* The podman network create command now features a new option, --ipam-driver, to specify details about how IP addresses are assigned to containers in the network.\n* The podman machine list command now features a new option, --quiet, to print only the names of configured VMs and no other information.\n* The --ipc option to the podman create, podman run, and podman pod create commands now supports three new modes: none, private, and shareable. The default IPC mode is now shareable, indicating the the IPC namespace can be shared with other containers.\n* The --mount option to the podman create and podman run commands can now set options for created named volumes via the volume-opt parameter.\n* The --mount option to the podman create and podman run commands now allows parameters to be passed in CSV format.\n* The --userns option to the podman create and podman run commands now supports a new option, nomap, that (only for rootless containers) does not map the UID of the user that started the container into the container, increasing security.\n* The podman import command now supports three new options, --arch, --os, and --variant, to specify what system the imported image was built for.\n* The podman inspect command now includes information on the network configuration of containers that joined a pre-configured network namespace with the --net ns: option to podman run, podman create, and podman pod create.\n* The podman run and podman create commands now support a new option, --chrootdirs, which specifies additional locations where container-specific files managed by Podman (e.g. /etc/hosts, `/etc/resolv.conf, etc) will be mounted inside the container (#12961).\n* The podman run and podman create commands now support a new option, --passwd-entry, allowing entries to be added to the container's /etc/passwd file.\n* The podman images --format command now accepts two new format directives: {{.CreatedAt}} and {{.CreatedSince}}.\n* The podman volume create command's -o option now accepts a new argument, o=noquota, to disable XFS quotas entirely and avoid potential issues when Podman is run on an XFS filesystem with existing quotas defined.\n* The podman info command now includes additional information on the machine Podman is running on, including disk utilization on the drive Podman is storing containers and images on, and CPU utilization.\n* Fix CVE-2022-27191 / bsc#1197284\n\n- Require catatonit \u003e= 0.1.7 for pause functionality needed by pods\n\nUpdate to version 4.0.3:\n\n* Security\n\n  - This release fixes CVE-2022-27649, where containers run by Podman would have excess inheritable capabilities set.\n\n* Changes\n\n  - The podman machine rm --force command will now remove running machines as well (such machines are shut down first, then removed) (#13448).\n  - When a podman machine VM is started that is using a too-old VM image, it will now start in a reduced functionality mode, and provide instructions on how to recreate it (previously, VMs were effectively unusable) (#13510).\n\n  - Updated the containers/common library to v0.47.5\n\n- This release addresses CVE-2021-4024 / bsc#1193166, where the podman machine command opened the gvproxy API (used to forward ports to podman machine VMs) to the public internet on port 7777.\n- This release addresses CVE-2021-41190 / bsc#1193273, where incomplete specification of behavior regarding image manifests could lead to inconsistent decoding on different clients.\n\nUpdate to version 3.1.0: (bsc#1181961, CVE-2021-20206)\n\n- A fix for CVE-2021-20199 / bsc#1181640 is included. Podman between v1.8.0 and v2.2.1 used 127.0.0.1 as the source address for all traffic forwarded into rootless containers by a forwarded port; this has been changed to address the issue.\n",

If a Content-Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content differently. The OCI Distribution Specification has been updated to require that a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations. Clients pulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or “manifests” and “config” fields if they are unable to update to version 1.0.1 of the spec.",
