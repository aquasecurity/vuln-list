      "Text": "This image update for google/sle-hpc-15-sp4-byos-v20230506-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Add avahi-CVE-2023-1981.patch: emit error if requested service  is not found (boo#1210328 CVE-2023-1981).\n- switch to use _multibuild\n- delete _avahi_spec-prepare.sh, pre_checkin.sh: obsolete\n- use https urls\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update to release 9.16.38  Bug Fixes:\n  * A constant stream of zone additions and deletions via rndc\n    reconfig could cause increased memory consumption due to\n    delayed cleaning of view memory. This has been fixed.\n  * The speed of the message digest algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2),\n    and of NSEC3 hashing, has been improved.\n  * Building BIND 9 failed when the --enable-dnsrps switch for\n    ./configure was used. This has been fixed.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Updated keyring and signature\n- Update to release 9.16.37\n  Security Fixes:\n  * An UPDATE message flood could cause named to exhaust all\n    available memory. This flaw was addressed by adding a new\n    update-quota option that controls the maximum number of\n    outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that named can hold in a queue\n    at any given time (default: 100). (CVE-2022-3094)\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG query\n    was received and stale-answer-client-timeout was set to a\n    non-zero value. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3736)\n  * named running as a resolver with the\n    stale-answer-client-timeout option set to any value greater\n    than 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when the\n    recursive-clients soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.\n    (CVE-2022-3924)\n  New Features:\n  * The new update-quota option can be used to control the number\n    of simultaneous DNS UPDATE messages that can be processed to\n    update an authoritative zone on a primary server, or forwarded\n    to the primary server by a secondary server. The default is\n    100. A new statistics counter has also been added to record\n    events when this quota is exceeded, and the version numbers for\n    the XML and JSON statistics schemas have been updated.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) feature in BIND\n    has been deprecated. Configuring DSCP values in named.conf now\n    causes a warning to be logged. Note that this feature has only\n    been partly operational since the new Network Manager was\n    introduced in BIND 9.16.0.\n  * The catalog zone implementation has been optimized to work with\n    hundreds of thousands of member zones.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * In certain query resolution scenarios (e.g. when following\n    CNAME records), named configured to answer from stale cache\n    could return a SERVFAIL response despite a usable, non-stale\n    answer being present in the cache. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1207471, bsc#1207473, bsc#1207475, jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.36\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The auto-dnssec option has been deprecated and will be removed\n    in a future BIND 9.19.x release. Please migrate to\n    dnssec-policy.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When a catalog zone was removed from the configuration, in some\n    cases a dangling pointer could cause the named process to\n    crash.\n  * When a zone was deleted from a server, a key management object\n    related to that zone was inadvertently kept in memory and only\n    released upon shutdown. This could lead to constantly\n    increasing memory use on servers with a high rate of changes\n    affecting the set of zones being served.\n  * In certain cases, named waited for the resolution of\n    outstanding recursive queries to finish before shutting down.\n  * The zone \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;class\u0026gt;: final reference detached log message\n    was moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to\n    prevent the named-checkzone tool from superfluously logging\n    this message in non-debug mode.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage c-ares was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.19.0  Security:\n  * Low. Stack overflow in ares_set_sortlist() which is used\n    during c-ares initialization and typically provided by an\n    administrator and not an end user.\n    (bsc#1208067, CVE-2022-4904)\n  Changes:\n  * Add ARES_OPT_HOSTS_FILE similar to ARES_OPT_RESOLVCONF for\n    specifying a custom hosts file location.\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Fix memory leak in reading /etc/hosts when using localhost\n    fallback.\n  * Fix chain building c-ares when libresolv is already included by\n    another project.\n  * File lookup should not immediately abort as there may be other\n    tries due to search criteria.\n  * Asterisks should be allowed in host validation as CNAMEs may\n    reference wildcard domains.\n  * AutoTools build system referenced bad STDC_HEADERS macro.\n  * Even if one address class returns a failure for\n    ares_getaddrinfo() we should still return the results we have.\n  * Fix ares_getaddrinfo() numerical address resolution with\n    AF_UNSPEC\n  * Fix tools and help information.\n  * Various documentation fixes and cleanups.\n  * Add include guards to ares_data.h\n  * c-ares could try to exceed maximum number of iovec entries\n    supported by system.\n  * The RFC6761 6.3 states localhost subdomains must be offline too\n- update to 1.18.1. Changes since 1.17.2:\n  * Allow '/' as a valid character for a returned name for\n    CNAME in-addr.arpa delegation\n  * no longer forwards requests for localhost resolution per RFC6761\n  * During a domain search, treat ARES_ENODATA as ARES_NXDOMAIN so\n    that the search process will continue to the next domain\n    in the search.\n  * Provide ares_nameser.h as a public interface as needed by NodeJS\n  * Add support for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) records via\n    ares_parse_uri_reply()\n- disable unit tests for SLE12 since GCC compiler too old to build\n  unit tests\n- 5c995d5.patch: upstreamed\n- disable-live-tests.patch: refreshed\n- new upstream website\n- drop multibuild - tests do not require static library anymore\n- spec file cleanup\n- drop sources that were re-added to upstream distibution\n  (c-ares-config.cmake.in ares_dns.h libcares.pc.cmake)\n- update to 1.17.2:\n  Security:\n  * When building c-ares with CMake, the RANDOM_FILE would not be set\n    and therefore downgrade to the less secure random number generator\n    it would cause a crash\n  * Expand number of escaped characters in DNS replies as per\n    RFC1035 5.1 to prevent spoofing follow-up\n    (bsc#1188881, CVE-2021-3672)\n  * Perform validation on hostnames to prevent possible XSS\n    due to applications not performing valiation themselves\n  Changes:\n  * ares_malloc(0) is now defined behavior (returns NULL) rather than system-specific to catch edge cases\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Building tests should not force building of static libraries except on Windows\n  * Relative headers must use double quotes to prevent pulling in a system library\n  for details see,\n  https://c-ares.haxx.se/changelog.html#1_17_2\n- update to 1.17.1:\n    Travis: add iOS target built with CMake (#378)\n    Issue #377 suggested that CMake builds for iOS with c-ares were broken. This PR adds an automatic Travis build for iOS CMake.\n  - fix build\n    External projects were using non-public header ares_dns.h, make public again (#376)\n    It appears some outside projects were relying on macros in ares_dns.h, even\n    though it doesn't appear that header was ever meant to be public.  That said,\n    we don't want to break external integrators so we should distribute this header\n    again.\n  - note that so versioning has moved to configure.ac\n  - note about 1.17.1\n  - fix sed gone wrong\n    autotools cleanup (#372)\n  * buildconf: remove custom logic with autoreconf\n- remove missing_header.patch (upstream)\n\nPackage cloud-netconfig was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.7:  + Overhaul policy routing setup (issue #19)\n  + Support alias IPv4 ranges (issue #14)\n  + Add support for NetworkManager (bsc#1204549)\n  + Remove dependency on netconfig\n  + Install into libexec directory\n  + Clear stale ifcfg files for accelerated NICs (bsc#1199853)\n  + More debug messages\n  + Documentation update\n- /etc/netconfig.d/ moved to /usr/libexec/netconfig/netconfig.d/ in\n  Tumbleweed, update path (poo#116221)\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update to version 10.1.0 (bsc#1207133, bsc#1208097, bsc#1208099 )  - Removes a warning about system_token entry present in the credentials\n  file.\n  - Adds logrotate configuration for log rotation.\n\nPackage containerd was updated:\n\n- Update to containerd v1.6.19 for Docker v23.0.2-ce.

To remove a PTF \u0026quot;/zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot;/ or a dedicated \u0026quot;/zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot;/ should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage makedumpfile was updated:\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1208999) with  fixes to PBKDF2 parameter validation.\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1208999) to\n  validate extra PBKDF2 parameters according to FIPS 140-3.\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1191546) to\n  update session-\u0026gt;lastOpWasFIPS before destroying the key after\n  derivation in the CKM_TLS12_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE,\n  CKM_NSS_TLS_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE_SHA256,\n  CKM_TLS_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE and CKM_SSL3_KEY_AND_MAC_DERIVE cases.\n- Update nss-fips-pct-pubkeys.patch (bsc#1207209) to remove some\n  excess code.\n- Update nss-fips-approved-crypto-non-ec.patch (bsc#1191546).\n- Add nss-fips-pct-pubkeys.patch (bsc#1207209) for pairwise consistency\n  checks.

When submit request on IBS for updating SLE shim, the submitreq\n  project be generated, but it always be blocked by checking the signature\n  of openSUSE shim.\n  It doesn't make sense checking openSUSE shim signature when building\n  SLE shim on SLE platform, and vice versa. So the following change adds the\n  logic to compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse).\n  When and only when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop\n  building.\n    [#] compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse)\n    [#] when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop building\n- Upgrade shim-install for bsc#1210382\n  After closing Leap-gap project since Leap 15.3, openSUSE Leap direct\n  uses shim from SLE. So the ca_string is 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure Boot\n  CA1', not 'openSUSE Secure Boot CA1'. It causes that the update_boot=no,\n  so all files in /boot/efi/EFI/boot are not updated.\n  The 86b73d1 patch added the logic that using ID field in os-release for\n  checking Leap distro and set ca_string to 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure\n  Boot CA1'.

Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers. ",

      "Description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

      "Description": "The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming\nASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n",
