      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp4-sap-byos-v20230623-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage HANA-Firewall was updated:\n\n- Missing SCR Agent for reading and writing /etc/sysconfig/hana-firewall from yast2  (bsc#1210981)\n\nPackage Mesa was updated:\n\n- U_ReturnME.patch  * fixes blackscreen in Return To Monkey Island on Intel graphics\n    (boo#1208145)\n\nPackage SAPHanaSR was updated:\n\n- Version bump to 0.162.1  * fix for SAPHanaTopology failing with error code 1\n    (OCF_ERR_GENERIC) during a normal stop action\n    (bsc#1207466)\n  * set srhook attribute to PRIM during a probe so that we do not\n    need to wait for the first srConnectionChanged() to set the\n    attribute\n    (bsc#1205535)\n- Version bump to 0.162.0\n  * add improvements from SAP to the RA scripts regarding the\n    handling of the SAP tools 'HDB version', 'HDBSettings.sh' and\n    'pycd' and the SAPHana log filter handling\n    (jsc#PED-1739, jsc#PED-2608)\n  * fix for SAPHanaSR-monitor reporting \u0026quot;/LPA status of one node is\n    missing\u0026quot;/\n    (bsc#1192963, bsc#1203973)\n  * SAPHanaSRTools.pm: shows terminate node attribute too\n- remove patch:\n    0001-bsc-1192963.patch\n\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- add profiles-permit-php-fpm-pid-files-directly-under-run.patch  https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/merge_requests/914 (bsc#1202344)\n\nPackage audit-secondary was updated:\n\nPackage autofs was updated:\n\n- autofs-5.1.3-revert-fix-argc-off-by-one-in-mount_aut.patch  Fix off-by-one error in recursive map handling. (bsc#1209653)\n\nPackage autoyast2 was updated:\n\n- Rebuild the RPM database during upgrade (--rebuilddb) (bsc#1209565)- 4.4.45\n- Properly install the selected products, do not lose them after\n  resetting the package manager internally (bsc#1202234)\n- 4.4.44\n- Add needed packages for kdump even when kdump section is not\n  defined if product enable kdump by default (bsc#1204180)\n- 4.4.43\n- Add support for security policies validation (jsc#SLE-24764).\n- 4.4.42\n- Allow empty values in ask/default, ask/selection/label and\n  ask/selection/value elements (bsc#1204448).\n- 4.4.41\n- Add needed packages for the selected network backend in order to\n  prevent it is not declared in the software section (bsc#1201235,\n  bsc#1201435)\n- 4.4.40\n\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Add avahi-CVE-2023-1981.patch: emit error if requested service  is not found (boo#1210328 CVE-2023-1981).\n- switch to use _multibuild\n- delete _avahi_spec-prepare.sh, pre_checkin.sh: obsolete\n- use https urls\n\nPackage bash-completion was updated:\n\n- Add patch fix-curl-help-completion-bsc1200791.patch (bsc#1200791)  * List all options for `curl --\u0026lt;TAB\u0026gt;`\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update to release 9.16.38  Bug Fixes:\n  * A constant stream of zone additions and deletions via rndc\n    reconfig could cause increased memory consumption due to\n    delayed cleaning of view memory. This has been fixed.\n  * The speed of the message digest algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2),\n    and of NSEC3 hashing, has been improved.\n  * Building BIND 9 failed when the --enable-dnsrps switch for\n    ./configure was used. This has been fixed.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Updated keyring and signature\n- Update to release 9.16.37\n  Security Fixes:\n  * An UPDATE message flood could cause named to exhaust all\n    available memory. This flaw was addressed by adding a new\n    update-quota option that controls the maximum number of\n    outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that named can hold in a queue\n    at any given time (default: 100). (CVE-2022-3094)\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG query\n    was received and stale-answer-client-timeout was set to a\n    non-zero value. This has been fixed. (CVE-2022-3736)\n  * named running as a resolver with the\n    stale-answer-client-timeout option set to any value greater\n    than 0 could crash with an assertion failure, when the\n    recursive-clients soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.\n    (CVE-2022-3924)\n  New Features:\n  * The new update-quota option can be used to control the number\n    of simultaneous DNS UPDATE messages that can be processed to\n    update an authoritative zone on a primary server, or forwarded\n    to the primary server by a secondary server. The default is\n    100. A new statistics counter has also been added to record\n    events when this quota is exceeded, and the version numbers for\n    the XML and JSON statistics schemas have been updated.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) feature in BIND\n    has been deprecated. Configuring DSCP values in named.conf now\n    causes a warning to be logged. Note that this feature has only\n    been partly operational since the new Network Manager was\n    introduced in BIND 9.16.0.\n  * The catalog zone implementation has been optimized to work with\n    hundreds of thousands of member zones.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * In certain query resolution scenarios (e.g. when following\n    CNAME records), named configured to answer from stale cache\n    could return a SERVFAIL response despite a usable, non-stale\n    answer being present in the cache. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1207471, bsc#1207473, bsc#1207475, jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.36\n  Feature Changes:\n  * The auto-dnssec option has been deprecated and will be removed\n    in a future BIND 9.19.x release. Please migrate to\n    dnssec-policy.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When a catalog zone was removed from the configuration, in some\n    cases a dangling pointer could cause the named process to\n    crash.\n  * When a zone was deleted from a server, a key management object\n    related to that zone was inadvertently kept in memory and only\n    released upon shutdown. This could lead to constantly\n    increasing memory use on servers with a high rate of changes\n    affecting the set of zones being served.\n  * In certain cases, named waited for the resolution of\n    outstanding recursive queries to finish before shutting down.\n  * The zone \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;class\u0026gt;: final reference detached log message\n    was moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to\n    prevent the named-checkzone tool from superfluously logging\n    this message in non-debug mode.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.35\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * A crash was fixed that happened when a dnssec-policy zone that\n    used NSEC3 was reconfigured to enable inline-signing.\n  * In certain resolution scenarios, quotas could be erroneously\n    reached for servers, including any configured forwarders,\n    resulting in SERVFAIL answers being sent to clients.\n  * rpz-ip rules in response-policy zones could be ineffective in\n    some cases if a query had the CD (Checking Disabled) bit set to\n    1.\n  * Previously, if Internet connectivity issues were experienced\n    during the initial startup of named, a BIND resolver with\n    dnssec-validation set to auto could enter into a state where it\n    would not recover without stopping named, manually deleting the\n    managed-keys.bind and managed-keys.bind.jnl files, and starting\n    named again.\n  * The statistics counter representing the current number of\n    clients awaiting recursive resolution results (RecursClients)\n    could overflow in certain resolution scenarios.\n  * Previously, BIND failed to start on Solaris-based systems with\n    hundreds of CPUs.\n  * When a DNS resource recordâs TTL value was equal to the\n    resolverâs configured prefetch âeligibilityâ value, the record\n    was erroneously not treated as eligible for prefetching.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n- Update to release 9.16.34\n  New Features:\n  * Support for parsing and validating the dohpath service\n    parameter in SVCB records was added.\n  * named now logs the supported cryptographic algorithms during\n    startup and in the output of named -V.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Changing just the TSIG key names for primaries in catalog\n    zonesâ member zones was not effective. This has been fixed.\n  Known Issues:\n  * Upgrading from BIND 9.16.32 or any older version may require a\n    manual configuration change. The following configurations are\n    affected:\n  - type primary zones configured with dnssec-policy but without\n    either allow-update or update-policy,\n  - type secondary zones configured with dnssec-policy.\n    In these cases please add inline-signing yes; to the individual\n    zone configuration(s). Without applying this change, named will\n    fail to start. For more details, see\n    https://kb.isc.org/docs/dnssec-policy-requires-dynamic-dns-or-inline-signing\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-maxpagesize.diff for a problem on old code  streams, where we would generate too large binaries.\n- s390-pic-dso.diff: use %pB instead of %B\n- SLE toolchain update of binutils.  Update to 2.39 from 2.37,\n  which means obsoleting and hence removing these patches:\n  binutils-add-efi-aarch64-1.diff, binutils-add-efi-aarch64-2.diff,\n  binutils-add-efi-aarch64-3.diff, binutils-fix-keepdebug.diff,\n  binutils-add-z16-name.diff.\n  Implements [jsc#SLE-25046, jsc#PED-2029, jsc#PED-2035, jsc#PED-2033,\n  jsc#PED-2030, jsc#PED-2038, jsc#PED-2032, jsc#PED-2034, jsc#PED-2031,\n  jsc#SLE-25047]\n- This fixes these CVEs relative to 2.37:\n  [bsc#1188374, bsc#1185597] aka (GCC) PR99935 aka CVE-2021-3648\n  [bsc#1193929] aka PR28694 aka CVE-2021-45078\n  [bsc#1194783] aka (GCC) PR98886 aka CVE-2021-46195\n  [bsc#1197592] aka (GCC) PR105039 aka CVE-2022-27943\n  [bsc#1202966] aka PR29289 aka CVE-2022-38126\n  [bsc#1202967] aka PR29290 aka CVE-2022-38127\n  [bsc#1202969] aka CVE-2021-3826\n- Add binutils-pr29482.diff for PR29482, aka CVE-2022-38533\n  [bsc#1202816]\n- Rebase binutils-2.39-branch.diff.gz that contains fix for PR29451.\n- Add binutils-2.39-branch.diff.gz.\n- Explicitly enable --enable-warn-execstack=yes and\t--enable-warn-rwx-segments=yes.\n- Add gprofng subpackage.\n- Update to binutils 2.39:\n  * The ELF linker will now generate a warning message if the stack is made\n    executable.  Similarly it will warn if the output binary contains a\n    segment with all three of the read, write and execute permission\n    bits set.  These warnings are intended to help developers identify\n    programs which might be vulnerable to attack via these executable\n    memory regions.\n    The warnings are enabled by default but can be disabled via a command\n    line option.  It is also possible to build a linker with the warnings\n    disabled, should that be necessary.\n  * The ELF linker now supports a --package-metadata option that allows\n    embedding a JSON payload in accordance to the Package Metadata\n    specification.\n  * In linker scripts it is now possible to use TYPE=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; in an output\n    section description to set the section type value.\n  * The objdump program now supports coloured/colored syntax\n    highlighting of its disassembler output for some architectures.\n    (Currently: AVR, RiscV, s390, x86, x86_64).\n  * The nm program now supports a --no-weak/-W option to make it ignore\n    weak symbols.\n  * The readelf and objdump programs now support a -wE option to prevent\n    them from attempting to access debuginfod servers when following\n    links.\n  * The objcopy program's --weaken, --weaken-symbol, and\n  - -weaken-symbols options now works with unique symbols as well.\n- Rebase binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff, binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff,\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff and remove binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz.\n- For now use --disable-gprofng.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1142579 aka CVE-2019-1010204 aka PR23765\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n- Use https for variosu links.\n- Update binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz (to 93054037f1e304e)\n  in order to include PR29087.\n- Enable multitarget build on riscv64\n- On SLE15 and later, use make -Oline to synchronize configure output by\n  lines\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n- Renumber Sources.\n- Fix ExcludeArch for ppc.\n- Make multibuild utilize only the main binutils.spec file.\n- Remove not needed README.First-for.SUSE.packagers, pre_checkin.sh.\n- Start using _multibuild for cross binutils.\n  (forward port from SLE)\n- Update binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz (to c210342d7f5) to include\n  recognition of 'z16' name for 'arch14' on s390.  [bsc#1198237]\n(Fake entry from SLE for tracking purposes:)\n- Add usage of a SUSE_ZNOW environment variable which allows switching\n  on \u0026quot;/-z now\u0026quot;/ by default using \u0026quot;/export SUSE_ZNOW=1\u0026quot;/, similar to\n  the SUSE_ASNEEDED variable.  Adds binutils-znow.patch.\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch: add back fix for boo#1191473,\n  which got lost in the update to 2.38.\n- Update binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz in order to include PR28879.\n- From Stefan BrÃ¼ns \u0026lt;stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de\u0026gt;:\n  * Install symlinks for all target specific tools on\n    arm-eabi-none [bsc#1185712]\n- Do not re-generate ld/ldlex.c, ld/ldgram.c, ld/ldgram.h and verify\n  that corresponding flex/bison files are not modified by a patch.\n- Use verbose mode for make for cross compilers.\n- Make it build on SLE-11 again.\n- Use verbose mode for make.\n- Update to binutils 2.38:\n  * elfedit: Add --output-abiversion option to update ABIVERSION.\n  * Add support for the LoongArch instruction set.\n  * Tools which display symbols or strings (readelf, strings, nm, objdump)\n    have a new command line option which controls how unicode characters are\n    handled.  By default they are treated as normal for the tool.  Using\n  - -unicode=locale will display them according to the current locale.\n    Using --unicode=hex will display them as hex byte values, whilst\n  - -unicode=escape will display them as escape sequences.  In addition\n    using --unicode=highlight will display them as unicode escape sequences\n    highlighted in red (if supported by the output device).\n  * readelf -r dumps RELR relative relocations now.\n  * Support for efi-app-aarch64, efi-rtdrv-aarch64 and efi-bsdrv-aarch64 has been\n    added to objcopy in order to enable UEFI development using binutils.\n  * ar: Add --thin for creating thin archives. -T is a deprecated alias without\n    diagnostics. In many ar implementations -T has a different meaning, as\n    specified by X/Open System Interface.\n  * Add support for AArch64 system registers that were missing in previous\n    releases.\n  * Add support for the LoongArch instruction set.\n  * Add a command-line option, -muse-unaligned-vector-move, for x86 target\n    to encode aligned vector move as unaligned vector move.\n  * Add support for Cortex-R52+ for Arm.\n  * Add support for Cortex-A510, Cortex-A710, Cortex-X2 for AArch64.\n  * Add support for Cortex-A710 for Arm.\n  * Add support for Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) for AArch64.\n  * The --multibyte-handling=[allow|warn|warn-sym-only] option tells the\n    assembler what to when it encoutners multibyte characters in the input.  The\n    default is to allow them.  Setting the option to \u0026quot;/warn\u0026quot;/ will generate a\n    warning message whenever any multibyte character is encountered.  Using the\n    option to \u0026quot;/warn-sym-only\u0026quot;/ will make the assembler generate a warning whenever a\n    symbol is defined containing multibyte characters.  (References to undefined\n    symbols will not generate warnings).\n  * Outputs of .ds.x directive and .tfloat directive with hex input from\n    x86 assembler have been reduced from 12 bytes to 10 bytes to match the\n    output of .tfloat directive.\n  * Add support for 'armv8.8-a', 'armv9-a', 'armv9.1-a', 'armv9.2-a' and\n    'armv9.3-a' for -march in AArch64 GAS.\n  * Add support for 'armv8.7-a', 'armv8.8-a', 'armv9-a', 'armv9.1-a',\n    'armv9.2-a' and 'armv9.3-a' for -march in Arm GAS.\n  * Add support for Intel AVX512_FP16 instructions.\n  * Add -z pack-relative-relocs/-z no pack-relative-relocs to x86 ELF\n    linker to pack relative relocations in the DT_RELR section.\n  * Add support for the LoongArch architecture.\n  * Add -z indirect-extern-access/-z noindirect-extern-access to x86 ELF\n    linker to control canonical function pointers and copy relocation.\n  * Add --max-cache-size=SIZE to set the the maximum cache size to SIZE\n    bytes.\n- Add binutils-2.38-branch.diff.gz.\n- Removed deletion of man pages as they should be properly packages\n  in tarball.\n- Rebased patches: aarch64-common-pagesize.patch, add-ulp-section.diff,\n  binutils-bfd_h.patch, binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff,\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff, binutils-skip-rpaths.patch\n  and binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff.\n- Enable PRU architecture for AM335x CPU (Beagle Bone Black board)\n- use fdupes on datadir\n- remove RPM_BUILD_ROOT usage and other cleanups\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28494.\n\nPackage c-ares was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.19.1  Security:\n  * CVE-2023-32067.

CVE-2022-43551]\n  * Fix Another HSTS bypass via IDN\n  * Add curl-CVE-2022-43551.patch\n- Add 1.50.0 as the minimum libnghttp2 build requirement version as\n  a bandaid. Curl's 7.86.0 release introduces the use of\n  nghttp2_option_set_no_rfc9113_leading_and_trailing_ws_validation,\n  introduced by nghttp2 1.50.0 release, without introducing a check\n  for the function/right version in their build scripts. This will\n  make Zypper/cURL unusable in some corner cases where users\n  installing something that requires libcurl4 before doing full\n  system upgrade, thus updating the cURL stack, but not\n  libnghttp2's.

(git-fixes).\n- commit 5ced514\n- usb: ucsi: Fix ucsi-\u0026gt;connector race (git-fixes).\n- commit 513d457\n- Define kernel-vanilla as source variant\n  The vanilla_only macro is overloaded. It is used for determining if\n  there should be two kernel sources built as well as for the purpose of\n  determmioning if vanilla kernel should be used for kernel-obs-build.\n  While the former can be determined at build time the latter needs to be\n  baked into the spec file template. Separate the two while also making\n  the latter more generic.\n  $build_dtbs is enabled on every single rt and azure branch since 15.3\n  when the setting was introduced, gate on the new $obs_build_variant\n  setting as well.\n- commit 36ba909\n- USB: fotg210: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 632f169\n- Refresh\n

Rather than asking for the right\n  credentials, the stored ones are used again and again.\n- zypp.conf: Introduce 'download.connect_timeout' [60 sec.]\n  (bsc#1208329)\n  Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection phase to\n  the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, it has\n  no impact once it has connected.

To remove a PTF \u0026quot;/zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot;/ or a dedicated \u0026quot;/zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot;/ should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage lvm2 was updated:\n\n- killed lvmlockd doesn't clear/adopt locks leading to inability to start volume group (bsc#1203216)  - bug-1203216_lvmlockd-purge-the-lock-resources-left-in-previous-l.patch\n- dracut-initqueue timeouts with 5.3.18-150300.59.63 kernel on ppc64le (bsc#1199074)\n  - in lvm2.spec, change device_mapper_version from 1.02.163 to %{lvm2_version}_1.02.163\n- lvmlockd is not supporting sanlock (bsc#1203482)\n  - set 1 for _supportsanlock in lvm2.spec for enabling sanlock.\n\nPackage makedumpfile was updated:\n\nPackage mlocate was updated:\n\n- Pass \u0026quot;/--shell=/bin/sh\u0026quot;/ to \u0026quot;/su\u0026quot;/ when running the \u0026quot;/updatedb\u0026quot;/  command so that we don't depend on the \u0026quot;/${RUN_UPDATEDB_AS}\u0026quot;/\n  user's login shell.

When submit request on IBS for updating SLE shim, the submitreq\n  project be generated, but it always be blocked by checking the signature\n  of openSUSE shim.\n  It doesn't make sense checking openSUSE shim signature when building\n  SLE shim on SLE platform, and vice versa. So the following change adds the\n  logic to compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse).\n  When and only when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop\n  building.\n    [#] compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse)\n    [#] when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop building\n- Upgrade shim-install for bsc#1210382\n  After closing Leap-gap project since Leap 15.3, openSUSE Leap direct\n  uses shim from SLE. So the ca_string is 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure Boot\n  CA1', not 'openSUSE Secure Boot CA1'. It causes that the update_boot=no,\n  so all files in /boot/efi/EFI/boot are not updated.\n  The 86b73d1 patch added the logic that using ID field in os-release for\n  checking Leap distro and set ca_string to 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure\n  Boot CA1'. Then /boot/efi/EFI/boot/* can also be updated.\n- https://github.com/SUSE/shim-resources (git log --oneline)\n  86b73d1 Fix that bootx64.efi is not updated on Leap\n  f2e8143 Use the long name to specify the grub2 key protector\n  7283012 cryptodisk: support TPM authorized policies\n  49e7a0d Do not use tpm_record_pcrs unless the command is in command.lst\n  26c6bd5 Have grub take a snapshot of \u0026quot;/relevant\u0026quot;/ TPM PCRs\n  5c2c3ad Handle different cases of controlling cryptomount volumes during first stage boot\n  a5c5734 Introduce --no-grub-install option\n- Updated shim signature after shim 15.7 be signed back:\n  signature-sles.x86_64.asc, signature-sles.aarch64.asc (bsc#1198458, CVE-2022-28737)\n- Add POST_PROCESS_PE_FLAGS=-N to the build command in shim.spec to\n  disable the NX compatibility flag when using post-process-pe because\n  grub2 is not ready.

      "Description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction.

This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.",

The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.",

The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,\nRSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\n\nFor example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an\nencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a\ngenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send\ntrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a\nsufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master\nsecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the\napplication data sent over that connection.\n\n",

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n",

We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\n\n",

As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.",

If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver.

      "Description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6, CUPS logs data of free memory to the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed, when it should have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.\n\nThe exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con-\u003ehttp)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",
