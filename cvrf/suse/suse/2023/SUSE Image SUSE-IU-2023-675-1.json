The function DH_check() performs\n    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it\n    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\n    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A\n    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus\n    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if\n    q is larger than p. If DH_check() is called with such q parameter\n    value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the\n    computationally intensive checks are skipped.\n  * Add openssl-1_1-CVE-2023-3817.patch\n\n- Dont pass zero length input to EVP_Cipher because assembler\n  optimized AES cannot handle zero size.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks\n    use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found\n    to be too large.\n    A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Reworked the Fix for the Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n    The previous fix for this timing side channel turned out to cause\n    a severe 2-3x performance regression in the typical use case\n    compared to 1.1.1s.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2022-4304.patch\n  * Removed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n  * Refreshed openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n\n- Update further expiring certificates that affect tests [bsc#1201627]\n  * Add openssl-Update-further-expiring-certificates.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430]\n  * Possible DoS translating ASN.1 object identifiers\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-2650.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0465, bsc#1209878]\n  * Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0465.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0466, bsc#1209873]\n  * Certificate policy check not enabled\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0466.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0464, bsc#1209624]\n  * Excessive Resource Usage Verifying X.509 Policy Constraints\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0464.patch\n\nPackage parted was updated:\n\n- fix null pointer dereference (bsc#1193412)  - add: parted-fix-check-diskp-in-do_name.patch\n- update mkpart options in manpage (bsc#1182142)\n  - add: parted-mkpart-manpage.patch\n\nPackage pcre2 was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1213514, CVE-2022-41409]  * Integer overflow vulnerability in pcre2test before 10.41\n    allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other\n    unspecified impacts via negative input.\n  * Add pcre2-CVE-2022-41409.patch\n\nPackage postgresql15 was updated:\n\n- Update to 15.4:  * bsc#1214059, CVE-2023-39417: Disallow substituting a schema or\n    owner name into an extension script if the name contains a\n    quote, backslash, or dollar sign.\n  * bsc#1214061, CVE-2023-39418: Fix MERGE to enforce row security\n    policies properly.\n  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/release-15-4.html\n\n- Update to 15.3:\n  * bsc#1211228, CVE-2023-2454:\n    Prevent CREATE SCHEMA from defeating changes in search_path\n  * bsc#1211229, CVE-2023-2455: Enforce row-level security\n    policies correctly after inlining a set-returning function\n  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/release-15-3.html\n\n- bsc#1210303: Stop using the obsolete internal %_restart_on_update\n  macro and drop support for sysv init to simplify the scriptlets.\n\n- Include -mini in Name: to avoid conflicts in the source package\n  name and OBS internal dependency tracking.\n\nPackage procps was updated:\n\n- Add patch CVE-2023-4016.patch  * CVE-2023-4016: ps buffer overflow (bsc#1214290)\n\n- Add patch bsc1209122-a6c0795d.patch\n  * Fix for bsc#1209122 to allow `-Â´ as leading character to ignore\n    possible errors on systctl entries\n\nPackage python-base was updated:\n\n- Fix the application of the python-2.7.17-switch-off-failing-SSL-tests.patch.\n- python-2.7.5-multilib.patch: Update for riscv64\n- Don't fail if _ctypes or dl extension was not built\n\n- The condition around libnsl-devel BuildRequires is NOT\n  switching off NIS support on SLE \u0026lt; 15, support for NIS used to\n  be in the glibc itself.

Rather than asking for the right\n  credentials, the stored ones are used again and again.\n- zypp.conf: Introduce 'download.connect_timeout' [60 sec.]\n  (bsc#1208329)\n  Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection phase to\n  the server to take.

This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE.

In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration.

We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\n\n",

However, two SSH settings were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.",

When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired and/or least-recently used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory use below the configured limit.\n\nIt has been discovered that the effectiveness of the cache-cleaning algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0 through 9.18.15, 9.19.0 through 9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.15-S1.",

This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.\n\nThe exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con-\u003ehttp)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",
