But, the stable patch that was\n  brought to SP3 implementing the this mechanism was done incorrectly, and\n  let's the kernel read from the userspace value instead of the cache in\n  one situation. This allows userspace to subvert the counter, hanging the\n  application forever.

This override is then used instead of an\n  actual type and allows to preserve modversions (CRCs) of symbols that\n  reference the type. It is kind of an alternative to doing kABI fix-ups\n  with '#ifndef __GENKSYMS__'. The functionality is hidden behind the\n  genksyms --preserve option which primarily tells the tool to strictly\n  verify modversions against a given reference file or fail.\n  Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff which is\n  present in various kernel-source branches separates the override logic.\n  It allows it to be enabled with a new --override flag and used without\n  specifying the --preserve option. Setting KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 in the spec\n  file is then a way how the build is told that --override should be\n  passed to all invocations of genksyms. This was needed for SUSE kernels\n  because their build doesn't use --preserve but instead resulting CRCs\n  are later checked by scripts/kabi.pl.\n  However, this override functionality was not utilized much in practice\n  and the only use currently to be found is in SLE11-SP1-LTSS. It means\n  that no one should miss this option and KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 together with\n  patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be removed.\n  Notes for maintainers merging this commit to their branches:\n  * Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be\n  dropped after merging this commit.\n  * Branch SLE11-SP1-LTSS uses the mentioned override functionality and\n  this commit should not be merged to it, or needs to be reverted\n  afterwards.\n- commit 4aa02b8\n\n- Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free in l2cap_sock_ready_cb\n  (bsc#1214233 CVE-2023-40283).\n- commit 11dc4cc\n\n- Refresh patches.suse/powerpc-Move-DMA64_PROPNAME-define-to-a-header.patch.\n- commit d263157\n\n- x86/speculation: Mark all Skylake CPUs as vulnerable to GDS (git-fixes).\n- commit a3ff58c\n\n- drm/vmwgfx: Test shader type against SVGA3d_SHADERTYPE_MIN (bsc#1203517 CVE-2022-36402)\n- commit 5b2dbae\n\n- cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread() (bsc#1208995\n  CVE-2023-1192).\n- commit 87f52bf\n\n- powerpc/rtas: remove ibm_suspend_me_token (bsc#1023051).\n- commit 4f01e57\n\n- Do not add and remove genksyms ifdefs\n- Refresh patches.kabi/lockdown-kABI-workaround-for-lockdown_reason-changes.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/lockdown-also-lock-down-previous-kgdb-use.patch.\n- commit e497b88\n\n- powerpc/rtas: move syscall filter setup into separate function\n  (bsc#1023051).\n- commit a36442d\n\n- rpm/mkspec-dtb: support for nested subdirs\n  Commit 724ba6751532 (\u0026quot;ARM: dts: Move .dts files to vendor\n  sub-directories\u0026quot;) moved the dts to nested subdirs, add a support for\n  that.

Separate the two while also making\n  the latter more generic.\n  $build_dtbs is enabled on every single rt and azure branch since 15.3\n  when the setting was introduced, gate on the new $obs_build_variant\n  setting as well.\n- commit 36ba909\n\n- series.conf: cleanup\n- update upstream references and resort:\n  - patches.suse/wifi-cfg80211-avoid-nontransmitted-BSS-list-corrupti.patch\n- commit 9bae747\n\n- net/ulp: use consistent error code when blocking ULP\n  (CVE-2023-0461 bsc#1208787).\n- net/ulp: prevent ULP without clone op from entering the LISTEN\n  status (CVE-2023-0461 bsc#1208787).\n- commit 028f0fd\n\n- rpm/constraints.in: increase the disk size for armv6/7 to 24GB\n  It grows and the build fails recently on SLE15-SP4/5.\n- commit 41ac816\n\n- rpm/check-for-config-changes: add TOOLCHAIN_NEEDS_* to IGNORED_CONFIGS_RE\n  This new form was added in commit e89c2e815e76 (\u0026quot;riscv: Handle\n  zicsr/zifencei issues between clang and binutils\u0026quot;).\n- commit 234baea\n\n- seq_buf: Fix overflow in seq_buf_putmem_hex() (bsc#1209549\n  CVE-2023-28772).\n- commit 5c5e4d3\n\n- PCI: hv: Add a per-bus mutex state_lock (bsc#1209785).\n- Revert \u0026quot;PCI: hv: Fix a timing issue which causes kdump to fail\n  occasionally\u0026quot; (bsc#1209785).\n- PCI: hv: Remove the useless hv_pcichild_state from struct\n  hv_pci_dev (bsc#1209785).\n- PCI: hv: Fix a race condition in hv_irq_unmask() that can\n  cause panic (bsc#1209785).\n- PCI: hv: fix a race condition bug in hv_pci_query_relations()\n  (bsc#1209785).\n- commit 6b9e385\n\n- kvm: initialize all of the kvm_debugregs structure before\n  sending it to userspace (bsc#1209532 CVE-2023-1513).\n- commit bd9c11d\n\n- Bluetooth: Fix double free in hci_conn_cleanup (bsc#1209052\n  CVE-2023-28464).\n- commit 677d920\n\n- net: tls: fix possible race condition between\n  do_tls_getsockopt_conf() and do_tls_setsockopt_conf()\n  (bsc#1209366 CVE-2023-28466).\n- commit 5f7c4a6\n\n- Move ENA upstream fix to sorted section.\n- commit aff6c71\n\n- RDMA/core: Don't infoleak GRH fields (bsc#1209778 CVE-2021-3923)\n- commit 50ba48b\n\n- tipc: fix NULL deref in tipc_link_xmit() (bsc#1209289\n  CVE-2023-1390).\n- commit b2c1533\n\n- tun: avoid double free in tun_free_netdev (bsc#1209635\n  CVE-2022-4744).\n- commit c5cf205\n\n- net/sched: tcindex: update imperfect hash filters respecting\n  rcu (CVE-2023-1281 bsc#1209634).\n- commit 97b3f9d\n\n- fs/proc: task_mmu.c: don't read mapcount for migration entry\n  (CVE-2023-1582, bsc#1209636).\n- commit 35d5c42\n\n- af_unix: Get user_ns from in_skb in unix_diag_get_exact()\n  (bsc#1209290 CVE-2023-28327).\n- commit 000517c\n\n- netlink: prevent potential spectre v1 gadgets (bsc#1209547\n  CVE-2017-5753).\n- commit cec3f24\n\n- tipc: add an extra conn_get in tipc_conn_alloc (bsc#1209288\n  CVE-2023-1382).\n- commit 6a58da4\n\n- tipc: set con sock in tipc_conn_alloc (bsc#1209288\n  CVE-2023-1382).\n- commit 06eaf34\n\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/sctp-fail-if-no-bound-addresses-can-be-used-for-a-gi.patch.\n- commit 890554b\n\n- media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in  az6027_i2c_xfer()\n  (bsc#1209291 CVE-2023-28328).\n- commit af7b7eb\n\n- rpm/group-source-files.pl: Fix output difference when / is in location\n  While previous attempt to fix group-source-files.pl in 6d651362c38\n  \u0026quot;rpm/group-source-files.pl: Deal with {pre,post}fixed / in location\u0026quot;\n  breaks the infinite loop, it does not properly address the issue.

The function DH_check() performs\n    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it\n    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\n    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A\n    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus\n    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if\n    q is larger than p. If DH_check() is called with such q parameter\n    value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the\n    computationally intensive checks are skipped.\n  * Add openssl-1_1-CVE-2023-3817.patch\n\n- Dont pass zero length input to EVP_Cipher because assembler\n  optimized AES cannot handle zero size.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks\n    use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found\n    to be too large.\n    A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Reworked the Fix for the Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n    The previous fix for this timing side channel turned out to cause\n    a severe 2-3x performance regression in the typical use case\n    compared to 1.1.1s.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2022-4304.patch\n  * Removed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n  * Refreshed openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n\n- Update further expiring certificates that affect tests [bsc#1201627]\n  * Add openssl-Update-further-expiring-certificates.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430]\n  * Possible DoS translating ASN.1 object identifiers\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-2650.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0465, bsc#1209878]\n  * Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0465.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0466, bsc#1209873]\n  * Certificate policy check not enabled\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0466.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0464, bsc#1209624]\n  * Excessive Resource Usage Verifying X.509 Policy Constraints\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0464.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207533, CVE-2023-0286]\n  * Fix X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GENERAL_NAME_cmp\n    for x400Address\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207536, CVE-2023-0215]\n  * Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF()\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-1of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-2of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-3of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-4of4.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207538, CVE-2022-4450]\n  * Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex()\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4450-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4450-2of2.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n\n- FIPS: list only FIPS approved public key algorithms\n  [bsc#1121365, bsc#1198472]\n  * Add openssl-1_1-fips-list-only-approved-pubkey-algorithms.patch\n\n- Added openssl-1_1-paramgen-default_to_rfc7919.patch\n  * bsc#1180995\n  * Default to RFC7919 groups when generating ECDH parameters\n    using 'genpkey' or 'dhparam' in FIPS mode.\n\n- Fix memory leaks introduced by openssl-1.1.1-fips.patch [bsc#1203046]\n  * Add patch openssl-1.1.1-fips-fix-memory-leaks.patch\n\nPackage pacemaker was updated:\n\n- controller: update node state correctly based on any existing node cache entry (bsc#1198767, bsc#1202177, bsc#1206268, bsc#1208380, bsc#1211098)  * bsc#1198767-0006-Fix-controller-update-node-state-correctly-based-on-.patch\n- libcrmcluster: internal functions for getting a node cache entry by uuid instead of id (bsc#1198767, bsc#1202177, bsc#1206268, bsc#1208380, bsc#1211098)\n  * bsc#1198767-0005-Refactor-libcrmcluster-internal-functions-for-gettin.patch\n- libcrmcluster: ability to search for a node cache entry by uuid instead of id (bsc#1198767, bsc#1202177, bsc#1206268, bsc#1208380, bsc#1211098)\n  * bsc#1198767-0004-Refactor-libcrmcluster-ability-to-search-for-a-node-.patch\n- cts-scheduler: update regression test about not fencing a pending node that doesn't have an uname in node state yet (bsc#1198767, bsc#1202177, bsc#1206268, bsc#1208380, bsc#1211098)\n  * bsc#1198767-0003-Test-cts-scheduler-update-regression-test-about-not-.patch\n- scheduler: Do not fence a pending node that doesn't have an uname in node state yet (bsc#1198767, bsc#1202177, bsc#1206268, bsc#1208380, bsc#1211098)\n  * bsc#1198767-0002-Fix-scheduler-Do-not-fence-a-pending-node-that-doesn.patch\n- cts-scheduler: add regression test about a pending node that doesn't have an uname in node state yet (bsc#1198767, bsc#1202177, bsc#1206268, bsc#1208380, bsc#1211098)\n  * bsc#1198767-0001-Test-cts-scheduler-add-regression-test-about-a-pendi.patch\n\n- rpm: build with --enable-legacy-links only for suse_version \u0026lt;

Remove faulty reference to a bug\n  actually fixed in 2019.\n- version 17.31.20 (22)\n\n- Fix zypp-tui/output/Out.h to build with clang.\n- Fix zypp/Arch.h for clang (fixes #478)\n  Clang seems to have issues with picking the overload in\n  std::men_fn if there is a static overload of a member function.\n  We need to explicitely specify the correct type of the function\n  pointer. To make sure this would not break compiling a\n  application with clang that builds against libzypp this patch\n  works around the problem.\n- version 17.31.19 (22)\n\n- SINGLE_RPMTRANS: Respect ZYPP_READONLY_HACK when checking the\n  zypp-rpm lock (fixes openSUSE/openSUSE-repos#29)\n- version 17.31.18 (22)\n\n- Fix wrong filesize exceeded dl abort in zyppng::Downloader\n  (bsc#1213673)\n  In some cases when downloading very small files we can run into\n  issues when the URL is protected by credentials.\n- version 17.31.17 (22)\n\n- Fix negative ZYPP_LOCK_TIMEOUT not waiting forever (bsc#1213231)\n- Don't cleanup orphaned dirs if read-only mode was promised\n  (bsc#1210740)\n- version 17.31.16 (22)\n\n- Fix build against protobuf \u0026gt;= 22 (fixes #465, closes #466)\n  Port away from protobuf_generate_cpp. Upstream protobuf does not\n  export protobuf_generate_cpp by default anymore.\n  Use protobuf_generate instead, which is also available on older\n  versions.\n- Remove SUSE \u0026lt; SLE11 constructs (fixes #464).\n- version 17.31.15 (22)\n\n- build: honor libproxy.pc's includedir (bsc#1212222)\n- Curl: trim all custom headers (bsc#1212187)\n  HTTP/2 RFC 9113 forbids fields ending with a space.

Rather than asking for the right\n  credentials, the stored ones are used again and again.\n- zypp.conf: Introduce 'download.connect_timeout' [60 sec.]\n  (bsc#1208329)\n  Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection phase to\n  the server to take.

To remove a PTF \u0026quot;zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot; or a dedicated \u0026quot;zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot; should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage lifecycle-data-sle-module-live-patching was updated:\n\n- Added data for 4_12_14-150100_197_151, 5_14_21-150400_24_69,  5_14_21-150500_55_7, 5_3_18-150200_24_157,\n  5_3_18-150300_59_127,\n  +kernel-livepatch-5_14_21-150400_15_37-rt,*,+kernel-livepatch-5_14_21-150400_15_40-rt,*,+kernel-livepatch-5_14_21-150500_11-rt,*,+kernel-livepatch-5_14_21-150500_13_5-rt,*.

      "Description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.",

The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.",

Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.",

This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall.  The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96\n\n",

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO.

We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\n\n",

When this time namespace is destroyed, the vvar page is also freed, but not removed from the process' memory, and a next page allocated by the kernel will be still available from the user-space process and can leak memory contents via this (read-only) use-after-free vulnerability.

The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24.

They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.",

      "Description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.\n\n",

This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.\n\nThe exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con-\u003ehttp)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the \"-check\" option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.",

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

This flaw allows RODCs and users possessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes, including sensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts, which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domain secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DC distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for error conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially granting access to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.",

This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the \"rpcecho\" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the \"rpcecho\" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a \"sleep()\" call in the \"dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()\" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the \"rpcecho\" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as \"rpcecho\" runs in the main RPC task.",

      "Description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n",

Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nDH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of\nother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other\nfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n\n",
