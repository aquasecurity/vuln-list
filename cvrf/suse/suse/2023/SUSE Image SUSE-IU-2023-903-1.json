(bsc#1214344)\n  To protect itself against userspace corrupting the counter of io_uring\n  dropped submission entries, the kernel relies on a cache of the counter\n  instead of reading the counter directly.  But, the stable patch that was\n  brought to SP3 implementing the this mechanism was done incorrectly, and\n  let's the kernel read from the userspace value instead of the cache in\n  one situation. This allows userspace to subvert the counter, hanging the\n  application forever. Fix the backport to read from the cached value.\n  5.3 stable is long dead, so there is nothing to fix upstream or in\n  - stable.\n- commit 2f88408\n\nPackage gcc13 was updated:\n\n- Add gcc13-bsc1216664.patch, works around SAP ASE DB crash during  C++ standard library initialization.  [bsc#1216664]\n\n- add pr111411.patch (bsc#1215427)\n\nPackage openssl-1_1 was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1216922, CVE-2023-5678]  * Fix excessive time spent in DH check / generation with large Q\n    parameter value.\n  * Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate\n    an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise,\n    applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex\n    () or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42\n    DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or\n    parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an\n    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-5678.patch\n\nPackage sqlite3 was updated:\n\n- Sync version 3.44.0 from Factory  * Fixes bsc#1210660, CVE-2023-2137: Heap buffer overflow\n  * sqlite3-rtree-i686.patch: temporary build fix for 32-bit x86.\n  * Obsoletes sqlite-CVE-2022-46908.patch\n  * Obsoletes sqlite-src-3390000-func7-pg-181.patch\n\nPackage libtirpc was updated:\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- Security update:  * [CVE-2023-45322, bsc#1216129] use-after-free in xmlUnlinkNode()\n    in tree.c\n  - Added file libxml2-CVE-2023-45322.patch\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Preliminary disable 'rpm --runposttrans' usage for chrooted  systems (bsc#1216091)\n  This limits the %transfiletrigger(postun|in) support in the\n  default installer if --root is used (as described in bsc#1041742).\n  The chrooted execution of the scripts in 'rpm --runposttrans'\n  broke in rpm-4.18. It's expected to be fixed in rpm-4.19.\n  Then we'll enable the feature again.\n- fix comment typo on zypp.conf (boo#1215979)\n- version 17.31.22 (22)\n\n- Attempt to delay %transfiletrigger(postun|in) execution if rpm\n  supports it (bsc#1041742)\n  Decide during installation whether rpm is capable of delayed\n  %posttrans %transfiletrigger(postun|in) execution or whether we\n  can just handle the packages %posttrans. On TW a delayed\n  %transfiletrigger handling is possible since rpm-4.17.\n- Make sure the old target is deleted before a new one is created\n  (bsc#1203760)\n- version 17.31.21 (22)\n\nPackage psmisc was updated:\n\nPackage python-psutil was updated:\n\n- Update in SLE-15 (bsc#1199282, jsc#PM-3243, jsc#SLE-24629)\n- Fix tests: setuptools changed the builddir library path and does\n  not find the module from it. Use the installed platlib instead\n  and exclude psutil.tests only later.\n- Refresh skip-obs.patch\n\nPackage salt was updated:\n\n- Randomize pre_flight_script path (CVE-2023-34049 bsc#1215157)- Allow all primitive grain types for autosign_grains (bsc#1214477)\n- Added:\n  * allow-all-primitive-grain-types-for-autosign_grains-.patch\n  * fix-cve-2023-34049-bsc-1215157.patch\n\n- Fix optimization_order opt to prevent testsuite fails\n- Improve salt.utils.json.find_json to avoid fails (bsc#1213293)\n- Use salt-call from salt bundle with transactional_update\n- Only call native_str on curl_debug message in tornado when needed\n- Implement the calling for batch async from the salt CLI\n- Fix calculation of SLS context vars when trailing dots\n  on targetted sls/state (bsc#1213518)\n- Rename salt-tests to python3-salt-testsuite\n- Added:\n  * only-call-native_str-on-curl_debug-message-in-tornad.patch\n  * fix-calculation-of-sls-context-vars-when-trailing-do.patch\n  * use-salt-call-from-salt-bundle-with-transactional_up.patch\n  * implement-the-calling-for-batch-async-from-the-salt-.patch\n  * improve-salt.utils.json.find_json-bsc-1213293.patch\n  * fix-optimization_order-opt-to-prevent-test-fails.patch\n\nPackage python-urllib3 was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2023-45803.patch (bsc#1216377, CVE-2023-45803)  gh#urllib3/urllib3@4e98d57809da\n\nPackage rsyslog was updated:\n\n- fix rsyslog crash in imrelp (bsc#1210286)  * add: 0001-Avoid-crash-on-restart-in-imrelp-SIGTTIN-handler.patch\n\nPackage runc was updated:\n\n- Update to runc v1.1.10.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n",
