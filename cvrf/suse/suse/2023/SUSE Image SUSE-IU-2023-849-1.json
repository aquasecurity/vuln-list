      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp4-sapcal-v20231128-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage aaa_base was updated:\n\n- Add patch git-47-04210f8df15da0ba4d741cfe1693af06f5978a1d.patch  * respect /etc/update-alternatives/java when setting JAVA_HOME\n    (bsc#1215434,bsc#1107342)\n\nPackage apache2 was updated:\n\n- Security update:  * Fix CVE-2023-31122 [bsc#1216424] mod_macro buffer over-read\n  * Added apache2-CVE-2023-31122.patch\n- Fix for bsc#1214357: apply the standard httpd content type handling\n  to responses from the backend.\n  * Added apache2-bsc1214357-mod_proxy_http2_apply-standard-content-type.patch\n\n- Fix for SG#65054, bsc#1207399:\n  Terminate threads before child exit.\n  * apache2-core-mpm-add-hook-child_stopped-that-gets-called-whe.patch\n  * apache2-core-prefork-run-new-hook-child_stopped-only-on-clea.patch\n  * apache2-mod_watchdog-add-assertions-to-cleanup-code.patch\n  * apache2-mod_watchdog-do-not-call-a-watchdog-instance-for.patch\n  * apache2-mod_watchdog-replace-the-new-volatile-with-atomic-ac.patch\n  * apache2-mod_watchdog-use-hook-child_stopping-to-signal-watch.patch\n  * apache2-mod_watchdog-use-the-child_stopping-and-child_stoppe.patch\n  * apache2-mpm-winnt-add-running-the-child_stopping-hook.patch\n\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- update zgrep profile to allow egrep helper use (bsc#1214458)  - zgrep-profile-sync-with-master.diff\n\n- Add pam_apparmor README, referenced from online cha-apparmor-pam.html\n  documentation (bsc#1213472)\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update to release 9.16.44  Security Fixes:\n  * Previously, sending a specially crafted message over the\n    control channel could cause the packet-parsing code to run out\n    of available stack memory, causing named to terminate\n    unexpectedly. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-3341)\n  [bsc#1215472]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.43\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Processing already-queued queries received over TCP could cause\n    an assertion failure, when the server was reconfigured at the\n    same time or the cache was being flushed. This has been fixed.\n\n- Add dnstap support\n  [jsc#PED-4852]\n\n- Log named-checkconf output [bsc#1213049]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.42\n  Security Fixes:\n  * The overmem cleaning process has been improved, to prevent the\n    cache from significantly exceeding the configured\n    max-cache-size limit. (CVE-2023-2828)\n  * A query that prioritizes stale data over lookup triggers a\n    fetch to refresh the stale data in cache. If the fetch is\n    aborted for exceeding the recursion quota, it was possible for\n    named to enter an infinite callback loop and crash due to stack\n    overflow. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-2911)\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Previously, it was possible for a delegation from cache to be\n    returned to the client after the stale-answer-client-timeout\n    duration. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1212544, bsc#1212567, jsc#SLE-24600]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.41\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When removing delegations from an opt-out range,\n    empty-non-terminal NSEC3 records generated by those delegations\n    were not cleaned up. This has been fixed.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.40\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Logfiles using timestamp-style suffixes were not always\n    correctly removed when the number of files exceeded the limit\n    set by versions. This has been fixed for configurations which\n    do not explicitly specify a directory path as part of the file\n    argument in the channel specification.\n  * Performance of DNSSEC validation in zones with many DNSKEY\n    records has been improved.\n\n- Update to release 9.16.39\n  Feature Changes:\n  * libuv support for receiving multiple UDP messages in a single\n    recvmmsg() system call has been tweaked several times between\n    libuv versions 1.35.0 and 1.40.0; the current recommended libuv\n    version is 1.40.0 or higher. New rules are now in effect for\n    running with a different version of libuv than the one used at\n    compilation time. These rules may trigger a fatal error at\n    startup:\n  - Building against or running with libuv versions 1.35.0 and\n    1.36.0 is now a fatal error.\n  - Running with libuv version higher than 1.34.2 is now a\n    fatal error when named is built against libuv version\n    1.34.2 or lower.\n  - Running with libuv version higher than 1.39.0 is now a\n    fatal error when named is built against libuv version\n    1.37.0, 1.38.0, 1.38.1, or 1.39.0.\n  * This prevents the use of libuv versions that may trigger an\n    assertion failure when receiving multiple UDP messages in a\n    single system call.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when adding a new\n    zone into the configuration file for a name which was already\n    configured as a member zone for a catalog zone. This has been\n    fixed.\n  * When named starts up, it sends a query for the DNSSEC key for\n    each configured trust anchor to determine whether the key has\n    changed. In some unusual cases, the query might depend on a\n    zone for which the server is itself authoritative, and would\n    have failed if it were sent before the zone was fully loaded.\n    This has now been fixed by delaying the key queries until all\n    zones have finished loading.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2.41 [PED-5778]:  * The MIPS port now supports the Sony Interactive Entertainment Allegrex\n  processor, used with the PlayStation Portable, which implements the MIPS\n  II ISA along with a single-precision FPU and a few implementation-specific\n  integer instructions.\n  * Objdump's --private option can now be used on PE format files to display the\n  fields in the file header and section headers.\n  * New versioned release of libsframe: libsframe.so.1.  This release introduces\n  versioned symbols with version node name LIBSFRAME_1.0.  This release also\n  updates the ABI in an incompatible way: this includes removal of\n  sframe_get_funcdesc_with_addr API, change in the behavior of\n  sframe_fre_get_ra_offset and sframe_fre_get_fp_offset APIs.\n  * SFrame Version 2 is now the default (and only) format version supported by\n  gas, ld, readelf and objdump.\n  * Add command-line option, --strip-section-headers, to objcopy and strip to\n  remove ELF section header from ELF file.\n  * The RISC-V port now supports the following new standard extensions:\n  - Zicond (conditional zero instructions)\n  - Zfa (additional floating-point instructions)\n  - Zvbb, Zvbc, Zvkg, Zvkned, Zvknh[ab], Zvksed, Zvksh, Zvkn, Zvknc, Zvkng,\n    Zvks, Zvksc, Zvkg, Zvkt (vector crypto instructions)\n  * The RISC-V port now supports the following vendor-defined extensions:\n  - XVentanaCondOps\n  * Add support for Intel FRED, LKGS and AMX-COMPLEX instructions.\n  * A new .insn directive is recognized by x86 gas.\n  * Add SME2 support to the AArch64 port.\n  * The linker now accepts a command line option of --remap-inputs\n  \u0026lt;PATTERN\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;FILE\u0026gt; to relace any input file that matches \u0026lt;PATTERN\u0026gt; with\n  \u0026lt;FILE\u0026gt;.  In addition the option --remap-inputs-file=\u0026lt;FILE\u0026gt; can be used to\n  specify a file containing any number of these remapping directives.\n  * The linker command line option --print-map-locals can be used to include\n  local symbols in a linker map.  (ELF targets only).\n  * For most ELF based targets, if the --enable-linker-version option is used\n  then the version of the linker will be inserted as a string into the .comment\n  section.\n  * The linker script syntax has a new command for output sections: ASCIZ \u0026quot;string\u0026quot;\n  This will insert a zero-terminated string at the current location.\n  * Add command-line option, -z nosectionheader, to omit ELF section\n  header.\n- Removed obsolete patches: binutils-2.40-branch.diff.gz,\n  riscv-dynamic-tls-reloc-pie.patch, riscv-pr22263-1.patch,\n  extensa-gcc-4_3-fix.diff .\n- Add binutils-2.41-branch.diff.gz .\n- Add binutils-old-makeinfo.diff for SLE-12 and older.\n- Rebased aarch64-common-pagesize.patch and binutils-revert-rela.diff .\n- Contains fixes for these non-CVEs (not security bugs per upstreams\n  SECURITY.md):\n  * bsc#1209642 aka CVE-2023-1579 aka PR29988\n  * bsc#1210297 aka CVE-2023-1972 aka PR30285\n  * bsc#1210733 aka CVE-2023-2222 aka PR29936\n  * bsc#1213458 aka CVE-2021-32256 aka PR105039 (gcc)\n  * bsc#1214565 aka CVE-2020-19726 aka PR26240\n  * bsc#1214567 aka CVE-2022-35206 aka PR29290\n  * bsc#1214579 aka CVE-2022-35205 aka PR29289\n  * bsc#1214580 aka CVE-2022-44840 aka PR29732\n  * bsc#1214604 aka CVE-2022-45703 aka PR29799\n  * bsc#1214611 aka CVE-2022-48065 aka PR29925\n  * bsc#1214619 aka CVE-2022-48064 aka PR29922\n  * bsc#1214620 aka CVE-2022-48063 aka PR29924\n  * bsc#1214623 aka CVE-2022-47696 aka PR29677\n  * bsc#1214624 aka CVE-2022-47695 aka PR29846\n  * bsc#1214625 aka CVE-2022-47673 aka PR29876\n\n- Add binutils-disable-dt-relr.sh for an compatibility problem\n  caused by binutils-revert-rela.diff in SLE codestreams.\n  Needed for update of glibc as that would otherwise pick up\n  the broken relative relocs support.  [bsc#1213282, PED-1435]\n- This only existed only for a very short while in SLE-15, as the main\n  variant in devel:gcc subsumed this in binutils-revert-rela.diff.\n  Hence:\n- Remove binutils-disable-dt-relr.sh as subsumed.\n\n- riscv-dynamic-tls-reloc-pie.patch: Backport for PR ld/22263 and PR\n  ld/25694\n- riscv-pr22263-1.patch: Backport for PR ld/22263\n\n- Rebase branch patch (includes fix for PR30281).\n\n- Document fixed CVEs:\n  * bnc#1208037 aka CVE-2023-25588 aka PR29677\n  * bnc#1208038 aka CVE-2023-25587 aka PR29846\n  * bnc#1208040 aka CVE-2023-25585 aka PR29892\n  * bnc#1208409 aka CVE-2023-0687 aka PR29444\n\n- Enable bpf-none cross target and add bpf-none to the multitarget\n  set of supported targets.\n\n- Disable packed-relative-relocs for old codestreams.  They generate\n  buggy relocations when binutils-revert-rela.diff is active.\n  [bsc#1206556]\n\n- Disable ZSTD debug section compress by default.\n\n- Enable zstd compression algorithm (instead of zlib)\n  for debug info sections by default.\n\n- Pack libgprofng only for supported platforms.\n\n- Remove upstreamed patch binutils-maxpagesize.diff.\n\n- Rebase binutils-2.40-branch.diff.gz as it includes fix for PR30043.\n- Move libgprofng-related libraries to the proper locations (packages).\n- Add --without=bootstrap for skipping of bootstrap (faster testing\n  of the package).\n\n- Remove broken arm32-avoid-copyreloc.patch to fix [gcc#108515]\n\n- Update to version 2.40:\n  * Objdump has a new command line option --show-all-symbols which will make it\n  display all symbols that match a given address when disassembling.  (Normally\n  only the first symbol that matches an address is shown).\n  * Add --enable-colored-disassembly configure time option to enable colored\n  disassembly output by default, if the output device is a terminal.  Note,\n  this configure option is disabled by default.\n  * DCO signed contributions are now accepted.\n  * objcopy --decompress-debug-sections now supports zstd compressed debug\n  sections.

rpm/kernel-binary.spec.in: Drop use of KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1\n  Genksyms has functionality to specify an override for each type in\n  a symtypes reference file. This override is then used instead of an\n  actual type and allows to preserve modversions (CRCs) of symbols that\n  reference the type. It is kind of an alternative to doing kABI fix-ups\n  with '#ifndef __GENKSYMS__'. The functionality is hidden behind the\n  genksyms --preserve option which primarily tells the tool to strictly\n  verify modversions against a given reference file or fail.\n  Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff which is\n  present in various kernel-source branches separates the override logic.\n  It allows it to be enabled with a new --override flag and used without\n  specifying the --preserve option. Setting KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 in the spec\n  file is then a way how the build is told that --override should be\n  passed to all invocations of genksyms. This was needed for SUSE kernels\n  because their build doesn't use --preserve but instead resulting CRCs\n  are later checked by scripts/kabi.pl.\n  However, this override functionality was not utilized much in practice\n  and the only use currently to be found is in SLE11-SP1-LTSS. It means\n  that no one should miss this option and KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 together with\n  patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be removed.\n  Notes for maintainers merging this commit to their branches:\n  * Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be\n  dropped after merging this commit.\n  * Branch SLE11-SP1-LTSS uses the mentioned override functionality and\n  this commit should not be merged to it, or needs to be reverted\n  afterwards.\n- commit 4aa02b8\n\n- drm/display: Don't assume dual mode adaptors support i2c\n  sub-addressing

Likewise,\n    applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex\n    () or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42\n    DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or\n    parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an\n    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-5678.patch\n\n- Displays \u0026quot;fips\u0026quot; in the version string (bsc#1215215)\n  * Add openssl-1_1-fips-bsc1215215_fips_in_version_string.patch\n\n- Security fix: (bsc#1213853, CVE-2023-3817)\n  * Fix excessive time spent checking DH q parameter value\n    (bsc#1213853, CVE-2023-3817). The function DH_check() performs\n    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it\n    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\n    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A\n    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus\n    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if\n    q is larger than p. If DH_check() is called with such q parameter\n    value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the\n    computationally intensive checks are skipped.\n  * Add openssl-1_1-CVE-2023-3817.patch\n\n- Dont pass zero length input to EVP_Cipher because assembler\n  optimized AES cannot handle zero size.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks\n    use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found\n    to be too large.\n    A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Check OCSP RESPONSE in s_client and terminate connection if a\n  revoked certificate is found.

Meaning the signal handler will do not much more than\n  setting a flag, which we are going to check in the normal program\n  flow as much as possible.\n- version 1.14.64\n\n- Changed location of bash completion script (bsc#1213854).\n  This changes the location of zypper.sh bash completion script\n  from /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/.\n- version 1.14.63\n\n- man: revised explanation of --force-resolution (bsc#1213557)\n  Point out that the option not only allows to remove packages but\n  may also violate any other active policy if there is no other way\n  to resolve the job.\n- Print summary hint if policies were violated due to\n  - -force-resolution (bsc#1213557)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.16 (for zypp-tui)\n- version 1.14.62\n\n- targetos: Add an error note if XPath:/product/register/target\n  is not defined in /etc/products.d/baseproduct (bsc#1211261)\n- targetos: Update help and man page (bsc#1211261)\n- version 1.14.61\n\n",

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,\nRSA-OEAP and RSASVE.\n\nFor example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an\nencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a\ngenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send\ntrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a\nsufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master\nsecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the\napplication data sent over that connection.",

This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container's outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.",

The security flaw occurs because the functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.",

For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request.

Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6, CUPS logs data of free memory to the logging service AFTER the connection has been closed, when it should have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.\n\nThe exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con-\u003ehttp)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.",
