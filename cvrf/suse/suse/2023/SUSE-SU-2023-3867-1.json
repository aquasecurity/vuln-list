Because the\n  old WAL record for native histograms is not backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data loss for the\n  latest data. Additionally, if you scrape 'float histograms' or use recording rules on native histograms in v2.42.0\n  (which writes float histograms), it is a one-way street since older versions do not support float histograms.\n  * [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format for the experimental native histograms\n  * [FEATURE] Add 'keep_firing_for' field to alerting rules\n  * [FEATURE] Promtool: Add support of selecting timeseries for TSDB dump\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Agent: Native histogram support.\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Support native histograms in recording rules\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add container ID as a meta label for pod targets for Kubernetes\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add VM size label to azure service discovery\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Support native histograms in federation\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Add gauge histogram support\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB/Scrape: Support FloatHistogram that represents buckets as float64 values\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Show individual scrape pools on /targets page\n- Changes from 2.41.0:\n  * [FEATURE] Relabeling: Add keepequal and dropequal relabel actions\n  * [FEATURE] Add support for HTTP proxy headers\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Reload private certificates when changed on disk\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Add max_version to specify maximum TLS version in tls_config\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Add goos and goarch labels to prometheus_build_info\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add proxy support for EC2 and LightSail SDs\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Add new metric prometheus_sd_file_watcher_errors_total\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Remote Read: Use a pool to speed up marshalling\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Improve handling of tombstoned chunks in iterators\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Optimize postings offset table reading\n  * [BUGFIX] Scrape: Validate the metric name, label names, and label values after relabeling\n  * [BUGFIX] Remote Write receiver and rule manager: Fix error handling\n- Changes from 2.40.7:\n  * [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix queries involving negative buckets of native histograms\n- Changes from 2.40.5:\n  * [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix queries involving native histograms due to improper reset of iterators\n- Changes from 2.40.3:\n  * [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix compaction after a deletion is called\n- Changes from 2.40.2:\n  * [BUGFIX] UI: Fix black-on-black metric name color in dark mode\n- Changes from 2.40.1:\n  * [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix alignment for atomic int64 for 32 bit architecture\n  * [BUGFIX] Scrape: Fix accept headers\n- Changes from 2.40.0:\n  * [FEATURE] Add experimental support for native histograms.\n    Enable with the flag --enable-feature=native-histograms.\n  * [FEATURE] SD: Add service discovery for OVHcloud\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Kubernetes SD: Use protobuf encoding\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Use golang.org/x/exp/slices for improved sorting speed\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Consul SD: Add enterprise admin partitions.

Prior to versions 0.7.2 and 0.8.2, if someone has access to a Prometheus web.yml file and users' bcrypted passwords, they can bypass security by poisoning the built-in authentication cache. Versions 0.7.2 and 0.8.2 contain a fix for the issue. There is no workaround, but attacker must have access to the hashed password to use this functionality.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2023-29409",
      "Description": "Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to \u003c= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.",
