Stack overflow in ares_set_sortlist() which is used\n    during c-ares initialization and typically provided by an\n    administrator and not an end user.\n    (bsc#1208067, CVE-2022-4904)\n  Changes:\n  * Add ARES_OPT_HOSTS_FILE similar to ARES_OPT_RESOLVCONF for\n    specifying a custom hosts file location.\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Fix memory leak in reading /etc/hosts when using localhost\n    fallback.\n  * Fix chain building c-ares when libresolv is already included by\n    another project.\n  * File lookup should not immediately abort as there may be other\n    tries due to search criteria.\n  * Asterisks should be allowed in host validation as CNAMEs may\n    reference wildcard domains.\n  * AutoTools build system referenced bad STDC_HEADERS macro.\n  * Even if one address class returns a failure for\n    ares_getaddrinfo() we should still return the results we have.\n  * Fix ares_getaddrinfo() numerical address resolution with\n    AF_UNSPEC\n  * Fix tools and help information.\n  * Various documentation fixes and cleanups.\n  * Add include guards to ares_data.h\n  * c-ares could try to exceed maximum number of iovec entries\n    supported by system.\n  * The RFC6761 6.3 states localhost subdomains must be offline too\n- update to 1.18.1. Changes since 1.17.2:\n  * Allow '/' as a valid character for a returned name for\n    CNAME in-addr.arpa delegation\n  * no longer forwards requests for localhost resolution per RFC6761\n  * During a domain search, treat ARES_ENODATA as ARES_NXDOMAIN so\n    that the search process will continue to the next domain\n    in the search.\n  * Provide ares_nameser.h as a public interface as needed by NodeJS\n  * Add support for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) records via\n    ares_parse_uri_reply()\n- disable unit tests for SLE12 since GCC compiler too old to build\n  unit tests\n- 5c995d5.patch: upstreamed\n- disable-live-tests.patch: refreshed\n- new upstream website\n- drop multibuild - tests do not require static library anymore\n- spec file cleanup\n- drop sources that were re-added to upstream distibution\n  (c-ares-config.cmake.in ares_dns.h libcares.pc.cmake)\n- update to 1.17.2:\n  Security:\n  * When building c-ares with CMake, the RANDOM_FILE would not be set\n    and therefore downgrade to the less secure random number generator\n    it would cause a crash\n  * Expand number of escaped characters in DNS replies as per\n    RFC1035 5.1 to prevent spoofing follow-up\n    (bsc#1188881, CVE-2021-3672)\n  * Perform validation on hostnames to prevent possible XSS\n    due to applications not performing valiation themselves\n  Changes:\n  * ares_malloc(0) is now defined behavior (returns NULL) rather than system-specific to catch edge cases\n  Bug fixes:\n  * Building tests should not force building of static libraries except on Windows\n  * Relative headers must use double quotes to prevent pulling in a system library\n  for details see,\n  https://c-ares.haxx.se/changelog.html#1_17_2\n- update to 1.17.1:\n    Travis: add iOS target built with CMake (#378)\n    Issue #377 suggested that CMake builds for iOS with c-ares were broken. This PR adds an automatic Travis build for iOS CMake.\n  - fix build\n    External projects were using non-public header ares_dns.h, make public again (#376)\n    It appears some outside projects were relying on macros in ares_dns.h, even\n    though it doesn't appear that header was ever meant to be public.  That said,\n    we don't want to break external integrators so we should distribute this header\n    again.\n  - note that so versioning has moved to configure.ac\n  - note about 1.17.1\n  - fix sed gone wrong\n    autotools cleanup (#372)\n  * buildconf: remove custom logic with autoreconf\n- remove missing_header.patch (upstream)\n\nPackage ca-certificates-mozilla was updated:\n\n- Updated to 2.60 state of Mozilla SSL root CAs (bsc#1206622)  Removed CAs:\n  - Global Chambersign Root\n  - EC-ACC\n  - Network Solutions Certificate Authority\n  - Staat der Nederlanden EV Root CA\n  - SwissSign Platinum CA - G2\n  Added CAs:\n  - DIGITALSIGN GLOBAL ROOT ECDSA CA\n  - DIGITALSIGN GLOBAL ROOT RSA CA\n  - Security Communication ECC RootCA1\n  - Security Communication RootCA3\n  Changed trust:\n  - TrustCor certificates only trusted up to Nov 30 (bsc#1206212)\n- Removed CAs (bsc#1206212) as most code does not handle \u0026quot;/valid before nov 30 2022\u0026quot;/\n  and it is not clear how many certs were issued for SSL middleware by TrustCor:\n  - TrustCor RootCert CA-1\n  - TrustCor RootCert CA-2\n  - TrustCor ECA-1\n  Patch: remove-trustcor.patch\n\nPackage catatonit was updated:\n\n- Update to catatont v0.1.7- This release adds the ability for catatonit to be used as the only\n  process in a pause container, by passing the -P flag (in this mode no\n  subprocess is spawned and thus no signal forwarding is done).\n- Add 99bb9048f.patch: configure.ac: call AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE only\n  once. Fix build with autocnf 2.71 / automake 1.16.5.\n- Update to catatonit v0.1.6, which fixes a few bugs -- mainly ones related to\n  socket activation or features somewhat adjacent to socket activation (such as\n  passing file descriptors).\n- Update catatonit-rpmlintrc in order to cover that static binaries are now an\n  error not a warning.\n\nPackage cloud-netconfig was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.7:  + Overhaul policy routing setup (issue #19)\n  + Support alias IPv4 ranges (issue #14)\n  + Add support for NetworkManager (bsc#1204549)\n  + Remove dependency on netconfig\n  + Install into libexec directory\n  + Clear stale ifcfg files for accelerated NICs (bsc#1199853)\n  + More debug messages\n  + Documentation update\n- /etc/netconfig.d/ moved to /usr/libexec/netconfig/netconfig.d/ in\n  Tumbleweed, update path (poo#116221)\n\nPackage containerd was updated:\n\n- Update to containerd v1.6.21 for Docker v23.0.6-ce.

bsc#1204827)\n  The kernel side for the TP 8013 and 8014 support was added before we\n  finished implementing the feature support in nvme-cli in 2.x.\n  As it turns out the rather old base version of nvme-cli would require\n  to completely re-implement the support for these feature for the 1.x\n  branch.\n  As SP3 is nearing it's end of the active update cycle, we decided\n  against to update the nvme-cli package hence these patches for the\n  kernel are not needed. In fact they introduce, regression due to the\n  nvme-cli package not able to do handle the new API correctly. So let's\n  remove these patches as there is no user for it.\n- Refresh patches.suse/nvme-add-iopolicy-module-parameter.patch.\n- Delete patches.kabi/kabi-fix-nvme-subsystype-change.patch.\n- Delete

So we make\n  sure all custom headers are trimmed. This also includes headers\n  returned by URL-Resolver plugins.\n- version 17.31.14 (22)\n- curl: Trim user agent string (bsc#1212187)\n  HTTP/2 RFC 9113 forbids fields ending with a space.

Rather than asking for the right\n  credentials, the stored ones are used again and again.\n- zypp.conf: Introduce 'download.connect_timeout' [60 sec.]\n  (bsc#1208329)\n  Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection phase to\n  the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, it has\n  no impact once it has connected. (see also CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT)\n- commit: Try to provide /dev fs if not present (fixes #444)\n- fix build with boost 1.82.\n- version 17.31.11 (22)\n- fix build with boost 1.82\n- BuildRequires: libsolv-devel \u0026gt;= 0.7.24 for x86_64_v[234]\n  support.\n- version 17.31.10 (22)\n- Workround bsc#1195633 while libsolv \u0026lt;= 0.7.23 is used.\n- Fix potential endless loop in new ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK.\n- ZYPP_METALINK_DEBUG=1: Log URL and priority of the mirrors\n  parsed from a metalink file.\n- multicurl: propagate ssl settings stored in repo url\n  (boo#1127591)\n  Closes #335.\n- Teach MediaNetwork to retry on HTTP2 errors.\n- fix CapDetail to return Rel::NONE if an EXPRESSION is used as a\n  NAMED cap.\n- Capability: support parsing richdeps from string.\n- defaultLoadSystem: default to LS_NOREFRESH if not root.\n- Detect x86_64_v[234]: Fix LZCNT bit used in detection (fixes\n  [#439])\n  Merges rpm-software-management/rpm#2412: The bit for LZCNT is in\n  CPUID 0x80000001, not 1.\n- Detect x86_64_v[234] architecture levels (fixes #439)\n- Support x86_64_v[234] architecture levels (for #439)\n- version 17.31.9 (22)\n- ProgressData: enforce reporting the INIT||END state\n  (bsc#1206949)\n- ps: fix service detection on newer Tumbleweed systems\n  (bsc#1205636)\n- version 17.31.8 (22)\n- Hint to \u0026quot;/zypper removeptf\u0026quot;/ to remove PTFs.\n- Removing a PTF without enabled repos should always fail\n  (bsc#1203248)\n  Without enabled repos, the dependent PTF-packages would be\n  removed (not replaced!) as well. To remove a PTF \u0026quot;/zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot;/ or a dedicated \u0026quot;/zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot;/ should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage lvm2 was updated:\n\n- killed lvmlockd doesn't clear/adopt locks leading to inability to start volume group (bsc#1203216)  - bug-1203216_lvmlockd-purge-the-lock-resources-left-in-previous-l.patch\n- dracut-initqueue timeouts with 5.3.18-150300.59.63 kernel on ppc64le (bsc#1199074)\n  - in lvm2.spec, change device_mapper_version from 1.02.163 to %{lvm2_version}_1.02.163\n- lvm2.spec %post deletes libdevmapper and triggers kernel panic (bsc#1198523)\n  - change %post behaviour, only do deleting job for non-link folder\n\nPackage microos-tools was updated:\n\n- Update to version 2.18:  - Add TMPDIR to tukit binddirs for Salt\n    [bsc#1211356] [bsc#1205011]\n  - 98selinux-microos: Add chroot as dependency\n  - Fix spelling error in warning\n- Update to version 2.17:\n  - selinux-autorelabel-generator: Don't cross partition boundaries\n  for /.snapshots when relabeling [issue#11]\n- Update to version 2.16:\n  - 98selinux-microos: Make the btrfs subvolume writable temporarily [boo#1202395]\n- Update to version 2.15\n  - 98selinux-microos: Add grep as dependency\n- Update to version 2.14\n  - Fix Makefile to install sysext-add-debug\n- Update to version 2.13\n  - 98selinux-microos: Don't rely on selinux=1 [bsc#1202449]\n  - Add sysext-add-debug\n  - Make sure /var/lib/overlay exists before relabeling\n- Update to version 2.12\n  - Remove special MicroOS firstboot script\n  - Remove locale-check, replaced by another aaa_base implementation\n- Add new subpackage microos-devel-tools\n- Add rpm as build dependency for that subpackage\n\nPackage ncurses was updated:\n\n- Modify patch ncurses-6.1.dif  * Secure writing terminfo entries by setfs[gu]id in s[gu]id\n    (boo#1210434, CVE-2023-29491)\n  * Reading is done since 2000/01/17\n\nPackage openldap2 was updated:\n\n- bsc#1212260 - crash in libldap when non-ldap data responds  * 0245-ITS-9803-Drop-connection-when-receiving-non-LDAP-dat.patch\n- bsc#1211795 - CVE-2023-2953 - Null pointer deref in ber_memalloc_x\n  * 0244-ITS-9904-ldif_open_url-check-for-ber_strdup-failure.patch\n\nPackage openssh was updated:\n\n- Add openssh-CVE-2023-38408-PKCS11-execution.patch, Abort if  requested to load a PKCS#11 provider that isnt a PKCS#11\n  provider (bsc#1213504,CVE-2023-38408)\n- openssh-7.7p1-fips_checks.patch: close the right filedescriptor\n  to avoid fd leads, and also close fdh in read_hmac (bsc#1209536)\n- Revert addition of openssh-dbus.sh, openssh-dbus.csh, openssh-dbus.fish:\n  This caused invalid and irrelevant environment assignments (bsc#1207014).\n- Add openssh-dbus.sh, openssh-dbus.csh, openssh-dbus.fish: Make ssh\n  connections update their dbus environment (bsc#1179465).\n- Add openssh-do-not-send-empty-message.patch: Prevent empty\n  messages from being sent.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied.

Updated shim.changes to add CVE-2022-28737 number for bsc#1198458.  The issue be fixed by upgrade to shim 15.7. (bsc#1198458, CVE-2022-28737)\n- Sometimes SLE shim signature be Microsoft updated before openSUSE shim\n  signature. When submit request on IBS for updating SLE shim, the submitreq\n  project be generated, but it always be blocked by checking the signature\n  of openSUSE shim.\n  It doesn't make sense checking openSUSE shim signature when building\n  SLE shim on SLE platform, and vice versa. So the following change adds the\n  logic to compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse).\n  When and only when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop\n  building.\n    [#] compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse)\n    [#] when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop building\n- Upgrade shim-install for bsc#1210382\n  After closing Leap-gap project since Leap 15.3, openSUSE Leap direct\n  uses shim from SLE. So the ca_string is 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure Boot\n  CA1', not 'openSUSE Secure Boot CA1'. It causes that the update_boot=no,\n  so all files in /boot/efi/EFI/boot are not updated.\n  The 86b73d1 patch added the logic that using ID field in os-release for\n  checking Leap distro and set ca_string to 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure\n  Boot CA1'. Then /boot/efi/EFI/boot/* can also be updated.\n- https://github.com/SUSE/shim-resources (git log --oneline)\n  86b73d1 Fix that bootx64.efi is not updated on Leap\n  f2e8143 Use the long name to specify the grub2 key protector\n  7283012 cryptodisk: support TPM authorized policies\n  49e7a0d Do not use tpm_record_pcrs unless the command is in command.lst\n  26c6bd5 Have grub take a snapshot of \u0026quot;/relevant\u0026quot;/ TPM PCRs\n  5c2c3ad Handle different cases of controlling cryptomount volumes during first stage boot\n  a5c5734 Introduce --no-grub-install option\n- Updated shim signature after shim 15.7 be signed back:\n  signature-sles.x86_64.asc, signature-sles.aarch64.asc (bsc#1198458, CVE-2022-28737)\n- Add POST_PROCESS_PE_FLAGS=-N to the build command in shim.spec to\n  disable the NX compatibility flag when using post-process-pe because\n  grub2 is not ready. (bsc#1205588)\n  - Kernel can boot with the NX compatibility flag since 82e0d6d76a2a7\n    be merged to v5.19.

This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction.

The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.",

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n",

The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\n\n",

If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.",
