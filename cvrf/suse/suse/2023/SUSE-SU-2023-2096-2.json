      "Text": "This update for netty, netty-tcnative fixes the following issues:\n\nnetty:\n\n- Security fixes included in this version update from 4.1.75 to 4.1.90:\n  * CVE-2022-24823: Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Netty on Unix-Like systems due temporary files for\n    Java 6 and lower in io.netty:netty-codec-http (bsc#1199338)\n  * CVE-2022-41881: HAProxyMessageDecoder Stack Exhaustion DoS (bsc#1206360)\n  * CVE-2022-41915: HTTP Response splitting from assigning header value iterator (bsc#1206379)\n    \n- Other non-security bug fixes included in this version update from 4.1.75 to 4.1.90:\n  * Build with Java 11 on ix86 architecture in order to avoid build failures \n  * Fix `HttpHeaders.names` for non-String headers\n  * Fix `FlowControlHandler` behaviour to pass read events when auto-reading is turned off\n  * Fix brotli compression\n  * Fix a bug in FlowControlHandler that broke auto-read\n  * Fix a potential memory leak bug has been in the pooled allocator\n  * Fix a scalability issue caused by instanceof and check-cast checks that lead to false-sharing on the \n    `Klass::secondary_super_cache` field in the JVM\n  * Fix a bug in our `PEMParser` when PEM files have multiple objects, and `BouncyCastle` is on the classpath\n  * Fix several `NullPointerException` bugs\n  * Fix a regression `SslContext` private key loading\n  * Fix a bug in `SslContext` private key reading fall-back path\n  * Fix a buffer leak regression in `HttpClientCodec`\n  * Fix a bug where some `HttpMessage` implementations, that also implement `HttpContent`, were not handled correctly\n  * Fix epoll bug when receiving zero-sized datagrams\n  * Fix a bug in `SslHandler` so `handlerRemoved` works properly even if `handlerAdded` throws an exception\n  * Fix an issue that allowed the multicast methods on `EpollDatagramChannel` to be called outside of an event-loop \n    thread\n  * Fix a bug where an OPT record was added to DNS queries that already had such a record\n  * Fix a bug that caused an error when files uploaded with HTTP POST contained a backslash in their name\n  * Fix an issue in the `BlockHound` integration that could occasionally cause NetUtil to be reported as performing\n    blocking operation.

      "Description": "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.",
