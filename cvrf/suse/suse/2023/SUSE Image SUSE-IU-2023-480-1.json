      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp5-chost-byos-v20230704-arm64 contains the following changes:\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update to release 9.16.42  Security Fixes:\n  * The overmem cleaning process has been improved, to prevent the\n    cache from significantly exceeding the configured\n    max-cache-size limit. (CVE-2023-2828)\n  * A query that prioritizes stale data over lookup triggers a\n    fetch to refresh the stale data in cache. If the fetch is\n    aborted for exceeding the recursion quota, it was possible for\n    named to enter an infinite callback loop and crash due to stack\n    overflow. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-2911)\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Previously, it was possible for a delegation from cache to be\n    returned to the client after the stale-answer-client-timeout\n    duration. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1212544, bsc#1212567, jsc#SLE-24600]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.41\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When removing delegations from an opt-out range,\n    empty-non-terminal NSEC3 records generated by those delegations\n    were not cleaned up. This has been fixed.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.40\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Logfiles using timestamp-style suffixes were not always\n    correctly removed when the number of files exceeded the limit\n    set by versions. This has been fixed for configurations which\n    do not explicitly specify a directory path as part of the file\n    argument in the channel specification.\n  * Performance of DNSSEC validation in zones with many DNSKEY\n    records has been improved.\n\n- Update to release 9.16.39\n  Feature Changes:\n  * libuv support for receiving multiple UDP messages in a single\n    recvmmsg() system call has been tweaked several times between\n    libuv versions 1.35.0 and 1.40.0; the current recommended libuv\n    version is 1.40.0 or higher. New rules are now in effect for\n    running with a different version of libuv than the one used at\n    compilation time. These rules may trigger a fatal error at\n    startup:\n  - Building against or running with libuv versions 1.35.0 and\n    1.36.0 is now a fatal error.\n  - Running with libuv version higher than 1.34.2 is now a\n    fatal error when named is built against libuv version\n    1.34.2 or lower.\n  - Running with libuv version higher than 1.39.0 is now a\n    fatal error when named is built against libuv version\n    1.37.0, 1.38.0, 1.38.1, or 1.39.0.\n  * This prevents the use of libuv versions that may trigger an\n    assertion failure when receiving multiple UDP messages in a\n    single system call.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when adding a new\n    zone into the configuration file for a name which was already\n    configured as a member zone for a catalog zone. This has been\n    fixed.\n  * When named starts up, it sends a query for the DNSSEC key for\n    each configured trust anchor to determine whether the key has\n    changed. In some unusual cases, the query might depend on a\n    zone for which the server is itself authoritative, and would\n    have failed if it were sent before the zone was fully loaded.\n    This has now been fixed by delaying the key queries until all\n    zones have finished loading.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage containerd was updated:\n\n- Update to containerd v1.6.21 for Docker v23.0.6-ce.

      "Description": "A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.",

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.",

      "Description": "Every `named` instance configured to run as a recursive resolver maintains a cache database holding the responses to the queries it has recently sent to authoritative servers. The size limit for that cache database can be configured using the `max-cache-size` statement in the configuration file; it defaults to 90% of the total amount of memory available on the host. When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired and/or least-recently used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory use below the configured limit.\n\nIt has been discovered that the effectiveness of the cache-cleaning algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0 through 9.18.15, 9.19.0 through 9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.15-S1.",
