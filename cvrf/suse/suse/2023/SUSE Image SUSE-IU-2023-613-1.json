(bsc#1212434 bsc#1213575 bsc#1211576)\n  412b8dbb32 umount: /usr/ should never be unmounted regardless of HAVE_SPLIT_USR or not (bsc#1211576)\n  16f897570a units: remove the restart limit on the modprobe@.service\n  e4e85b08bd tests: add test case for long unit names\n  3f84b06f9d core: shorten long unit names that are based on paths and append path hash at the end (bsc#1208194)\n\n- Add 5001-sleep-don-t-init-sys-power-resume-if-resume-option-i.patch (bsc#1186606)\n\n- Make sure to pre-install the groups systemd and udev rely on. This is needed\n  when the tmpfiles are run at package installation time (i.e. when\n  file-triggers are disabled).\n\n- Move more packaging fixups in the fixlet script.\n\n- Move the persistent net rule fix in udev fixlet script.\n\n- Rather than having one script per fix, use a single script (or \u0026quot;fixlet\u0026quot;) per\n  (sub) package that contains all the fixups relative to a (sub) package. This\n  has the advantage to limit the number of scripts but more importantly it will\n  ease the sharing of the spec file between TW and SLE. We should also be able\n  to compare the fixlets of two distros even if the spec files have diverged.\n  Note that all the fixups are run just once now.\n\n- kbd-model-map.legacy:: add 'ara' which should replace 'arabic' in the long\n  term (bsc#1210702)\n\n- kbd-model-map.legacy: drop some entries no longer needed by YaST\n  Related to bsc#1194609.\n\n- Include pam_keyinit.so in our systemd-user PAM service (bsc#1209741)\n  That way \u0026quot;systemd --user\u0026quot; instances get their own session keyring instead of\n  the user default session keyring. For some reasons cifscreds refuses to work\n  with the latter. That's what is expected for every PAM session anyway.\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Fixup changes for 17.31.16. Remove faulty reference to a bug  actually fixed in 2019.\n- version 17.31.20 (22)\n\n- Fix zypp-tui/output/Out.h to build with clang.\n- Fix zypp/Arch.h for clang (fixes #478)\n  Clang seems to have issues with picking the overload in\n  std::men_fn if there is a static overload of a member function.\n  We need to explicitely specify the correct type of the function\n  pointer. To make sure this would not break compiling a\n  application with clang that builds against libzypp this patch\n  works around the problem.\n- version 17.31.19 (22)\n\n- SINGLE_RPMTRANS: Respect ZYPP_READONLY_HACK when checking the\n  zypp-rpm lock (fixes openSUSE/openSUSE-repos#29)\n- version 17.31.18 (22)\n\n- Fix wrong filesize exceeded dl abort in zyppng::Downloader\n  (bsc#1213673)\n  In some cases when downloading very small files we can run into\n  issues when the URL is protected by credentials.\n- version 17.31.17 (22)\n\n- Fix negative ZYPP_LOCK_TIMEOUT not waiting forever (bsc#1213231)\n- Don't cleanup orphaned dirs if read-only mode was promised\n  (bsc#1210740)\n- version 17.31.16 (22)\n\n- Fix build against protobuf \u0026gt;= 22 (fixes #465, closes #466)\n  Port away from protobuf_generate_cpp. Upstream protobuf does not\n  export protobuf_generate_cpp by default anymore.\n  Use protobuf_generate instead, which is also available on older\n  versions.\n- Remove SUSE \u0026lt; SLE11 constructs (fixes #464).\n- version 17.31.15 (22)\n\nPackage rsyslog was updated:\n\n-patches replaced by upgrade (see details in upgrade logs below)  0001-fixing-the-deleteStateOnFileDelete-option.patch\n  0001-imfile-Remove-inotify-watch-descriptor-on-inode-chan.patch\n  0001-queue-Add-NULL-check-in-qDeqLinkedList.patch\n  0001-testbench-add-test-for-legacy-permittedPeer-statemen.patch\n  0002-imtcp-bugfix-legacy-config-directives-did-no-longer-.patch\n  CVE-2022-24903.patch\n- Upgrade to rsyslog 8.2306.0 (jsc#PED-4883)\n  * 2023-06-09: mmnormalize bugfix: if msg cannot be parsed, parser chain is stopped\n  * 2023-06-08: Add new global config option \u0026quot;libcapng.default\u0026quot;\n  * 2023-06-08: imjournal: Add FileCreateMode module parameter\n  * 2023-04-17: core bugfix: potential segfault on busy systems\n  * 2023-05-11: GNUTls Driver: Fix memory leaks in gtlsInitCred\n  * 2023-05-24: CI: update base ubuntu image for github actions\n  * 2023-05-16: OMHIREDIS::ADDED:: New support for 'stream' mode\n  * 2023-05-17: OMHIREDIS::ADDED:: new tests for existing functionalities\n  * 2023-04-25: OMHIREDIS::FIXED:: Correctly suspend module in case of failure\n  * 2023-05-17: OMHIREDIS::FIXED:: Synchronously try to authenticate\n  * 2023-04-25: IMHIREDIS::ADDED:: New support for 'stream' mode\n  * 2023-04-25: REDIS::ADDED:: Implement tests for imhiredis module\n  * 2023-04-12: IMHIREDIS::CLEAN:: various improvements and fixes\n    [#]## CHANGED\n  -

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-24903",
      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",
