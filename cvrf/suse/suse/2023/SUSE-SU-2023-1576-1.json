SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_{READ|WRITE}32 was missing locks that could have been used in a use-after-free that could have resulted in a priviledge escalation to gain ring0 access from the system user (bsc#1207190).\n",

The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.",
