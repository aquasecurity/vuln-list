      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp5-sapcal-v20230921-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- Add pam_apparmor README, referenced from online cha-apparmor-pam.html  documentation (bsc#1213472)\n\nPackage autoyast2 was updated:\n\n- Properly install the selected products, do not lose them after  resetting the package manager internally (bsc#1202234)\n- 4.5.14\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Add dnstap support  [jsc#PED-4852]\n\n- Log named-checkconf output [bsc#1213049]\n\n- rebuild bind-utils on libuv updates (bsc#1212090)\n\n- Update to release 9.16.42\n  Security Fixes:\n  * The overmem cleaning process has been improved, to prevent the\n    cache from significantly exceeding the configured\n    max-cache-size limit. (CVE-2023-2828)\n  * A query that prioritizes stale data over lookup triggers a\n    fetch to refresh the stale data in cache. If the fetch is\n    aborted for exceeding the recursion quota, it was possible for\n    named to enter an infinite callback loop and crash due to stack\n    overflow. This has been fixed. (CVE-2023-2911)\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Previously, it was possible for a delegation from cache to be\n    returned to the client after the stale-answer-client-timeout\n    duration. This has been fixed.\n  [bsc#1212544, bsc#1212567, jsc#SLE-24600]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.41\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * When removing delegations from an opt-out range,\n    empty-non-terminal NSEC3 records generated by those delegations\n    were not cleaned up. This has been fixed.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\n- Update to release 9.16.40\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Logfiles using timestamp-style suffixes were not always\n    correctly removed when the number of files exceeded the limit\n    set by versions. This has been fixed for configurations which\n    do not explicitly specify a directory path as part of the file\n    argument in the channel specification.\n  * Performance of DNSSEC validation in zones with many DNSKEY\n    records has been improved.\n\n- Update to release 9.16.39\n  Feature Changes:\n  * libuv support for receiving multiple UDP messages in a single\n    recvmmsg() system call has been tweaked several times between\n    libuv versions 1.35.0 and 1.40.0; the current recommended libuv\n    version is 1.40.0 or higher. New rules are now in effect for\n    running with a different version of libuv than the one used at\n    compilation time. These rules may trigger a fatal error at\n    startup:\n  - Building against or running with libuv versions 1.35.0 and\n    1.36.0 is now a fatal error.\n  - Running with libuv version higher than 1.34.2 is now a\n    fatal error when named is built against libuv version\n    1.34.2 or lower.\n  - Running with libuv version higher than 1.39.0 is now a\n    fatal error when named is built against libuv version\n    1.37.0, 1.38.0, 1.38.1, or 1.39.0.\n  * This prevents the use of libuv versions that may trigger an\n    assertion failure when receiving multiple UDP messages in a\n    single system call.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * named could crash with an assertion failure when adding a new\n    zone into the configuration file for a name which was already\n    configured as a member zone for a catalog zone. This has been\n    fixed.\n  * When named starts up, it sends a query for the DNSSEC key for\n    each configured trust anchor to determine whether the key has\n    changed. In some unusual cases, the query might depend on a\n    zone for which the server is itself authoritative, and would\n    have failed if it were sent before the zone was fully loaded.\n    This has now been fixed by delaying the key queries until all\n    zones have finished loading.\n  [jsc#SLE-24600]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-disable-dt-relr.sh for an compatibility problem  caused by binutils-revert-rela.diff in SLE codestreams.\n  Needed for update of glibc as that would otherwise pick up\n  the broken relative relocs support.

The function DH_check() performs\n    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it\n    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\n    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A\n    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus\n    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if\n    q is larger than p. If DH_check() is called with such q parameter\n    value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the\n    computationally intensive checks are skipped.\n  * Add openssl-1_1-CVE-2023-3817.patch\n\n- Dont pass zero length input to EVP_Cipher because assembler\n  optimized AES cannot handle zero size.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and\n    OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits\n    in length.\n    However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the\n    key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks\n    use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found\n    to be too large.\n    A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits. Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Reworked the Fix for the Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n    The previous fix for this timing side channel turned out to cause\n    a severe 2-3x performance regression in the typical use case\n    compared to 1.1.1s.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2022-4304.patch\n  * Removed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n  * Refreshed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0464.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0465.patch\n\n- Update further expiring certificates that affect tests [bsc#1201627]\n  * Add openssl-Update-further-expiring-certificates.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430]\n  * Possible DoS translating ASN.1 object identifiers\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-2650.patch\n\nPackage parted was updated:\n\n- fix null pointer dereference (bsc#1193412)  - add: parted-fix-check-diskp-in-do_name.patch\n- update mkpart options in manpage (bsc#1182142)\n  - add: parted-mkpart-manpage.patch\n\nPackage pcre2 was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1213514, CVE-2022-41409]  * Integer overflow vulnerability in pcre2test before 10.41\n    allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other\n    unspecified impacts via negative input.\n  * Add pcre2-CVE-2022-41409.patch\n\nPackage procps was updated:\n\n- Add patch CVE-2023-4016.patch  * CVE-2023-4016: ps buffer overflow (bsc#1214290)\n\nPackage libssh2_org was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1214527, CVE-2020-22218]  * The function _libssh2_packet_add() allows to access out of\n    bounds memory.\n  * Add libssh2_org-CVE-2020-22218.patch\n\nPackage suseconnect-ng was updated:\n\n- Update to version 1.1.0~git2.f42b4b2a060e:  * Keep keepalive timer states when replacing SUSEConnect (bsc#1211588)\n\nPackage systemd was updated:\n\n- Import commit b473c02cc08e093e370034425671cbc001c6748e  02caac7973 units/initrd-parse-etc.service: Conflict with emergency.target\n  70b3bff9f8 sd-device-monitor: dynamically allocate receive buffer (bsc#1213873)\n  e2e1fbba2b sd-device: change type of properties nulstr from uint8_t* to char*\n  c9d3dd5954 udev: set description for device monitor\n  3f07f44fde test: use sd_device_monitor_set_description()\n  b304a1e1a2 sd-device-monitor: logs description for device monitor\n  929d4066c5 sd-device-monitor: introduce sd_device_monitor_{set,get}_description()\n  340e523048 sd-device-monitor: fix inversed condition\n  02659c7b67 tree-wide: port various places over to new stat_inode_same() helper\n  b35a4b042a stat-util: add helper stat_inode_same() for comparing stat's st_dev/st_ino in one\n  d25219cbe3 libsystemd: ignore both EINTR and EAGAIN\n  648a151313 errno-util: introduce ERRNO_IS_TRANSIENT()\n\n- Import commit 155fe1917157bdeecf7e28ef0ea9f62084f27f14\n  3b8c671f90 detach-md: similar to the DM case, also don't try to detach MD device backing /usr/ (bsc#1211576)\n  6da5d2d1fc shutdown: don't attempt to detach DM volume backing /usr/ (bsc#1211576)\n  37178881c1 udev: decrease devlink priority for iso disks (bsc#1213185)\n  02ede28319 shutdown: get only active md arrays.

      "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.",

The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer), and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validated by IPSec.",

This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",
