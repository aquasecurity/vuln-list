      "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version) installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation, where the \"msiexec.exe\" process, running under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry.\n\nThe issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases, the \"msiexec.exe\" process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or \"non-privileged\") users. Consequently, unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged \"msiexec.exe\" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2023-31147",
      "Description": "c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4 implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4 implementation. No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.",

If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver.
