79d5655\n\n- rpm/kernel-binary.spec.in: Drop use of KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1\n  Genksyms has functionality to specify an override for each type in\n  a symtypes reference file. This override is then used instead of an\n  actual type and allows to preserve modversions (CRCs) of symbols that\n  reference the type. It is kind of an alternative to doing kABI fix-ups\n  with '#ifndef __GENKSYMS__'. The functionality is hidden behind the\n  genksyms --preserve option which primarily tells the tool to strictly\n  verify modversions against a given reference file or fail.\n  Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff which is\n  present in various kernel-source branches separates the override logic.\n  It allows it to be enabled with a new --override flag and used without\n  specifying the --preserve option. Setting KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 in the spec\n  file is then a way how the build is told that --override should be\n  passed to all invocations of genksyms. This was needed for SUSE kernels\n  because their build doesn't use --preserve but instead resulting CRCs\n  are later checked by scripts/kabi.pl.\n  However, this override functionality was not utilized much in practice\n  and the only use currently to be found is in SLE11-SP1-LTSS. It means\n  that no one should miss this option and KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 together with\n  patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be removed.\n  Notes for maintainers merging this commit to their branches:\n  * Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be\n  dropped after merging this commit.\n  * Branch SLE11-SP1-LTSS uses the mentioned override functionality and\n  this commit should not be merged to it, or needs to be reverted\n  afterwards.\n- commit 4aa02b8\n\n- Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free in l2cap_sock_ready_cb\n  (bsc#1214233 CVE-2023-40283).\n- commit 11dc4cc\n\n- Refresh patches.suse/powerpc-Move-DMA64_PROPNAME-define-to-a-header.patch.\n- commit d263157\n\n- x86/speculation: Mark all Skylake CPUs as vulnerable to GDS (git-fixes).\n- commit a3ff58c\n\n- drm/vmwgfx: Test shader type against SVGA3d_SHADERTYPE_MIN (bsc#1203517 CVE-2022-36402)\n- commit 5b2dbae\n\n- cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread() (bsc#1208995\n  CVE-2023-1192).\n- commit 87f52bf\n\n- powerpc/rtas: remove ibm_suspend_me_token (bsc#1023051).\n- commit 4f01e57\n\n- Do not add and remove genksyms ifdefs\n- Refresh patches.kabi/lockdown-kABI-workaround-for-lockdown_reason-changes.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/lockdown-also-lock-down-previous-kgdb-use.patch.\n- commit e497b88\n\n- powerpc/rtas: move syscall filter setup into separate function\n  (bsc#1023051).\n- commit a36442d\n\n- rpm/mkspec-dtb: support for nested subdirs\n  Commit 724ba6751532 (\u0026quot;ARM: dts: Move .dts files to vendor\n  sub-directories\u0026quot;) moved the dts to nested subdirs, add a support for\n  that.

VUL-0: CVE-2023-20593: xen: x86/AMD: Zenbleed\n  (XSA-433)\n  xsa433.patch\n- Updated fix for XSA-417 (bsc#1204489)\n  64ba268b-xenstore-fix-XSA-417.patch\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n- Fix name of the bash completion script (bsc#1215007)  In 1.14.63 the location of the bash completion script was changed\n  to /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/. But the patch failed\n  to also rename the completion script. The original script name\n  zypper.sh is not recognized at the new location.\n- Update notes about failing signature checks (bsc#1214395)\n  It might be a transient issue if the server is in the midst of\n  receiving new data. Retry after a few minutes might work.\n- Improve the SIGINT handler to be signal safe (bsc#1214292)\n  This patch updates the SIGINT handling strategy to be signal\n  safe. Meaning the signal handler will do not much more than\n  setting a flag, which we are going to check in the normal program\n  flow as much as possible.\n- version 1.14.64\n\n- Changed location of bash completion script (bsc#1213854).\n  This changes the location of zypper.sh bash completion script\n  from /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/.\n- version 1.14.63\n\n- man: revised explanation of --force-resolution (bsc#1213557)\n  Point out that the option not only allows to remove packages but\n  may also violate any other active policy if there is no other way\n  to resolve the job.\n- Print summary hint if policies were violated due to\n  - -force-resolution (bsc#1213557)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.16 (for zypp-tui)\n- version 1.14.62\n\n",

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer.
