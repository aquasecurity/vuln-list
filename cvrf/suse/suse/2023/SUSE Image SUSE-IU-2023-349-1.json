This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage ncurses was updated:\n\n- Modify patch ncurses-6.1.dif  * Secure writing terminfo entries by setfs[gu]id in s[gu]id\n    (boo#1210434, CVE-2023-29491)\n  * Reading is done since 2000/01/17\n\nPackage nfs-utils was updated:\n\n- Rename all drop-in options.conf files as 10-options.conf  This makes it easier for other packages to over-ride\n  with a drop-in with a later sequence number.\n  resource-agents does this.\n  (bsc#1207843)\n- 0026-modprobe-avoid-error-messages-if-sbin-sysctl-fail.patch\n  Avoid modprobe errors when sysctl is not installed.\n  (bsc#1200710 bsc#1207022 bsc#1206781)\n- 0027-nfsd-allow-server-scope-to-be-set-with-config-or-com.patch\n  Add \u0026quot;/-S scope\u0026quot;/ option to rpc.nfsd to simplify fail-over cluster\n  config.\n  (bsc#1203746)\n\nPackage openldap2 was updated:\n\n- bsc#1211795 - CVE-2023-2953 - Null pointer deref in ber_memalloc_x  * 0244-ITS-9904-ldif_open_url-check-for-ber_strdup-failure.patch\n\nPackage openssh was updated:\n\n- Revert addition of openssh-dbus.sh, openssh-dbus.csh, openssh-dbus.fish:  This caused invalid and irrelevant environment assignments (bsc#1207014).\n\nPackage openssl-1_1 was updated:\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430]  * Possible DoS translating ASN.1 object identifiers\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-2650.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0465, bsc#1209878]\n  * Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0465.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0466, bsc#1209873]\n  * Certificate policy check not enabled\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0466.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0464, bsc#1209624]\n  * Excessive Resource Usage Verifying X.509 Policy Constraints\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0464.patch\n\nPackage procps was updated:\n\n- Add patch bsc1209122-a6c0795d.patch  * Fix for bsc#1209122 to allow `-Â´ as leading character to ignore\n    possible errors on systctl entries\n\nPackage python-packaging was updated:\n\n- Update in SLE-15 (bsc#1199282, jsc#PM-3243, jsc#SLE-24629)- Add patch to fix testsuite on big-endian targets\n  + fix-big-endian-build.patch\n- Ignore python3.6.2 since the test doesn't support it.\n- update to 21.3:\n  * Add a pp3-none-any tag (gh#pypa/packaging#311)\n  * Replace the blank pyparsing 3 exclusion with a 3.0.5 exclusion\n    (gh#pypa/packaging#481), (gh#pypa/packaging#486)\n  * Fix a spelling mistake (gh#pypa/packaging#479)\n- update to 21.2:\n  * Update documentation entry for 21.1.\n  * Update pin to pyparsing to exclude 3.0.0.\n  * PEP 656: musllinux support\n  * Drop support for Python 2.7, Python 3.4 and Python 3.5.\n  * Replace distutils usage with sysconfig\n  * Add support for zip files in ``parse_sdist_filename``\n  * Use cached ``_hash`` attribute to short-circuit tag equality comparisons\n  * Specify the default value for the ``specifier`` argument to ``SpecifierSet``\n  * Proper keyword-only \u0026quot;/warn\u0026quot;/ argument in packaging.tags\n  * Correctly remove prerelease suffixes from ~= check\n  * Fix type hints for ``Version.post`` and ``Version.dev``\n  * Use typing alias ``UnparsedVersion``\n  * Improve type inference for ``packaging.specifiers.filter()``\n  * Tighten the return type of ``canonicalize_version()``\n- Add Provides: for python*dist(packaging): work around boo#1186870\n- skip tests failing because of no-legacyversion-warning.patch\n- add no-legacyversion-warning.patch to restore compatibility with 20.4\n- update to 20.9:\n  * Run [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) over the code base (:issue:`377`)\n  * Add support for the ``macosx_10_*_universal2`` platform tags (:issue:`379`)\n  * Introduce ``packaging.utils.parse_wheel_filename()`` and ``parse_sdist_filename()``\n- update to 20.8:\n  * Revert back to setuptools for compatibility purposes for some Linux distros (:issue:`363`)\n  * Do not insert an underscore in wheel tags when the interpreter version number\n    is more than 2 digits (:issue:`372`)\n  * Fix flit configuration, to include LICENSE files (:issue:`357`)\n  * Make `intel` a recognized CPU architecture for the `universal` macOS platform tag (:issue:`361`)\n  * Add some missing type hints to `packaging.requirements` (issue:`350`)\n  * Officially support Python 3.9 (:issue:`343`)\n  * Deprecate the ``LegacyVersion`` and ``LegacySpecifier`` classes (:issue:`321`)\n  * Handle ``OSError`` on non-dynamic executables when attempting to resolve\n    the glibc version string.\n- update to 20.4:\n  * Canonicalize version before comparing specifiers.

The issue be fixed by upgrade to shim 15.7. (bsc#1198458, CVE-2022-28737)\n- Sometimes SLE shim signature be Microsoft updated before openSUSE shim\n  signature. When submit request on IBS for updating SLE shim, the submitreq\n  project be generated, but it always be blocked by checking the signature\n  of openSUSE shim.\n  It doesn't make sense checking openSUSE shim signature when building\n  SLE shim on SLE platform, and vice versa. So the following change adds the\n  logic to compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse).\n  When and only when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop\n  building.\n    [#] compare suffix (sles, opensuse) with distro_id (sle, opensuse)\n    [#] when hash mismatch and distro_id match with suffix, stop building\n- Upgrade shim-install for bsc#1210382\n  After closing Leap-gap project since Leap 15.3, openSUSE Leap direct\n  uses shim from SLE. So the ca_string is 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure Boot\n  CA1', not 'openSUSE Secure Boot CA1'. It causes that the update_boot=no,\n  so all files in /boot/efi/EFI/boot are not updated.\n  The 86b73d1 patch added the logic that using ID field in os-release for\n  checking Leap distro and set ca_string to 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Secure\n  Boot CA1'. Then /boot/efi/EFI/boot/* can also be updated.\n- https://github.com/SUSE/shim-resources (git log --oneline)\n  86b73d1 Fix that bootx64.efi is not updated on Leap\n  f2e8143 Use the long name to specify the grub2 key protector\n  7283012 cryptodisk: support TPM authorized policies\n  49e7a0d Do not use tpm_record_pcrs unless the command is in command.lst\n  26c6bd5 Have grub take a snapshot of \u0026quot;/relevant\u0026quot;/ TPM PCRs\n  5c2c3ad Handle different cases of controlling cryptomount volumes during first stage boot\n  a5c5734 Introduce --no-grub-install option\n- Updated shim signature after shim 15.7 be signed back:\n  signature-sles.x86_64.asc, signature-sles.aarch64.asc (bsc#1198458, CVE-2022-28737)\n- Add POST_PROCESS_PE_FLAGS=-N to the build command in shim.spec to\n  disable the NX compatibility flag when using post-process-pe because\n  grub2 is not ready.

The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.",

We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\n\n",
