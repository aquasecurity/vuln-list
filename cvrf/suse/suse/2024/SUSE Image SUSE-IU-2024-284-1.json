It was introduced in 2010 but haven't received\n  any updates on any branch since 2015. The file is renamed by tar-up.sh\n  to config-options.changes.txt and shipped in the kernel-source RPM\n  package under /usr/share/doc. As its content now only contains outdated\n  information, retaining it can lead to confusion for users encountering\n  this file.\n  Config changes are nowadays described in associated Git commit messages,\n  which get automatically collected and are incorporated into changelogs\n  of kernel RPM packages.\n  Drop then this obsolete file, starting with its packaging logic.\n  For branch maintainers: Upon merging this commit on your branch, please\n  correspondingly delete the file doc/config-options.changes.\n- commit adedbd2\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Simplify the list of references (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Reduce indentation in the list of references, make the style consistent\n  with README.md.\n- commit 70e3c33\n\n- regmap: fix bogus error on regcache_sync success (git-fixes).\n- platform/surface: aggregator: fix recv_buf() return value\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit e5d6930\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Add how to update the config for module signing\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Configuration files for SUSE kernels include settings to integrate with\n  signing support provided by the Open Build Service. This creates\n  problems if someone tries to use such a configuration file to build\n  a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; kernel as described in doc/README.SUSE:\n  * Default configuration files available in the kernel-source repository\n  unset CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL to leave module signing to\n  pesign-obs-integration. In case of a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; build, this\n  integration is not available and the modules don't get signed.\n  * The kernel spec file overrides CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to\n  \u0026quot;.kernel_signing_key.pem\u0026quot; which is a file populated by certificates\n  provided by OBS but otherwise not available. The value ends up in\n  /boot/config-$VERSION-$RELEASE-$FLAVOR and /proc/config.gz. If someone\n  decides to use one of these files as their base configuration then the\n  build fails with an error because the specified module signing key is\n  missing.\n  Add information on how to enable module signing and where to find the\n  relevant upstream documentation.\n- commit a699dc3\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Remove how to build modules using kernel-source\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Remove the first method how to build kernel modules from the readme. It\n  describes a process consisting of the kernel-source installation,\n  configuring this kernel and then performing an ad-hoc module build.\n  This method is not ideal as no modversion data is involved in the\n  process. It results in a module with no symbol CRCs which can be wrongly\n  loaded on an incompatible kernel.\n  Removing the method also simplifies the readme because only two main\n  methods how to build the modules are then described, either doing an\n  ad-hoc build using kernel-devel, or creating a proper Kernel Module\n  Package.\n- commit 9285bb8\n\n- blacklist.conf: just in case fix for a corner case\n- commit a3fc582\n\n- xhci: Clear EHB bit only at end of interrupt handler\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit d5adf2a\n\n- usb: config: fix iteration issue in 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()'\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 5cdcb2d\n\n- usb: host: xhci-plat: fix possible kernel oops while resuming\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit b0504f4\n\n- NFS: More fixes for nfs_direct_write_reschedule_io()\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Use the correct commit info in nfs_join_page_group()\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: More O_DIRECT accounting fixes for error paths\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix O_DIRECT locking issues (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix error handling for O_DIRECT write scheduling\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix a potential data corruption (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix a use after free in nfs_direct_join_group()\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- nfs: only issue commit in DIO codepath if we have uncommitted\n  data (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix a few more clear_bit() instances that need release\n  semantics (bsc#1211162).\n- commit e61bcf9\n\n- xfs: make sure maxlen is still congruent with prod when rounding\n  down (git-fixes).\n- commit 2b9fc44\n\n- xfs: fix units conversion error in xfs_bmap_del_extent_delay\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 95e2620\n\n- xfs: fix agf_fllast when repairing an empty AGFL (git-fixes).\n- commit bfb62b0\n\n- xfs: return EINTR when a fatal signal terminates scrub\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit e6f4fe7\n\n- xfs: fix a bug in the online fsck directory leaf1 bestcount\n  check (git-fixes).\n- commit e328537\n\n- xfs: fix incorrect unit conversion in scrub tracepoint\n  (git-fixes).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/xfs-standardize-AG-block-number-formatting-in-ftrace-output.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/xfs-standardize-AG-number-formatting-in-ftrace-output.patch.\n- commit e256630\n\n- xfs: decode scrub flags in ftrace output (git-fixes).\n- commit d1fe7f7\n\n- xfs: remove the xfs_dsb_t typedef (git-fixes).\n- commit 4e9f379\n\n- xfs: fix uninit warning in xfs_growfs_data (git-fixes).\n- commit e9c4821\n\n- xfs: convert flex-array declarations in struct xfs_attrlist*\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit e33e297\n\n- xfs: remove the xfs_dinode_t typedef (git-fixes).\n- commit c807e19\n\n- xfs: convert flex-array declarations in xfs attr shortform\n  objects (git-fixes).\n- commit 757cbc7\n\n- xfs: convert flex-array declarations in xfs attr leaf blocks\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 1823624\n\n- xfs: use swap() to make dabtree code cleaner (git-fixes).\n- commit d160cc2\n\n- xfs: fix silly whitespace problems with kernel libxfs\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit d822e52\n\n- xfs: rename xfs_has_attr() (git-fixes).\n- commit fe8702c\n\n- xfs: Rename __xfs_attr_rmtval_remove (git-fixes).\n- commit 6ea2cef\n\n- xfs: sysfs: use default_groups in kobj_type (git-fixes).\n- commit 74d9b5c\n\n- xfs: replace snprintf in show functions with sysfs_emit\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 84db35d\n\n- xfs: simplify two-level sysctl registration for xfs_table\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 0321d28\n\n- xfs: add selinux labels to whiteout inodes (git-fixes).\n- commit 8dc479c\n\n- xfs: Use kvcalloc() instead of kvzalloc() (git-fixes).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/xfs-reject-crazy-array-sizes-being-fed-to-XFS_IOC_GE.patch.\n- commit 89900e3\n\n- xfs: clean up \u0026quot;%Ld/%Lu\u0026quot;

Currently\n  only the media backend will utilize this, but can be extended to\n  all code paths that use g_poll() to wait for events.\n- Manually poll fds for curl in MediaCurl.\n  Using curl_easy_perform does not give us the required control on\n  when we want to cancel a download. Switching to the MultiCurl\n  implementation with a external poll() event loop will give us\n  much more freedom and helps us to improve our Ctrl+C handling.\n- Move reusable curl poll code to curlhelper.h.\n- version 17.31.29 (22)\n\n- Fix to build with libxml 2.12.x (fixes #505)\n- version 17.31.28 (22)\n\n- CheckAccessDeleted: fix 'running in container' filter\n  (bsc#1218291)\n- version 17.31.27 (22)\n\n- Call zypp commit plugins during transactional update (fixes #506)\n- Add support for loongarch64 (fixes #504)\n- Teach MediaMultiCurl to download HTTP Multibyte ranges.\n- Teach zsync downloads to MultiCurl.\n- Expand RepoVars in URLs downloading a .repo file (bsc#1212160)\n  Convenient and helps documentation as it may refer to a single\n  command for a bunch of distributions. Like e.g. \u0026quot;zypper ar\n  'https://server.my/$releasever/my.repo'\u0026quot;.\n- version 17.31.26 (22)\n\n- Fix build issue with zchunk build flags (fixes #500)\n- version 17.31.25 (22)\n\n- Open rpmdb just once during execution of %posttrans scripts\n  (bsc#1216412)\n- Avoid using select() since it does not support fd numbers \u0026gt;\n  1024 (fixes #447)\n- tools/DownloadFiles: use standard zypp progress bar (fixes #489)\n- Revert \u0026quot;Color download progress bar\u0026quot; (fixes #475)\n  Cyan is already used for the output of RPM scriptlets. Avoid this\n  colorific collision between download progress bar and scriptlet\n  output.\n- Fix ProgressBar's calculation of the printed tag position (fixes #494)\n- Switch zypp::Digest to Openssl 3.0 Provider API (fixes #144)\n- Fix usage of deprecated CURL features (fixes #486)\n- version 17.31.24 (22)\n\n- Stop using boost version 1 timer library (fixes #489,\n  bsc#1215294)\n- version 17.31.23 (22)\n\nPackage netcfg was updated:\n\nPackage openssh was updated:\n\n- Added openssh-cve-2023-51385.patch (bsc#1218215, CVE-2023-51385).  This limits the use of shell metacharacters in host- and\n  user names.\n\n- Added openssh-cve-2023-48795.patch (bsc#1217950, CVE-2023-48795).\n  This mitigates a prefix truncation attack that could be used to\n  undermine channel security.\n\n- Enhanced SELinux functionality. Added\n  * openssh-7.8p1-role-mls.patch\n    Proper handling of MLS systems and basis for other SELinux\n    improvements\n  * openssh-6.6p1-privsep-selinux.patch\n    Properly set contexts during privilege separation\n  * openssh-6.6p1-keycat.patch\n    Add ssh-keycat command to allow retrival of authorized_keys\n    on MLS setups with polyinstantiation\n  * openssh-6.6.1p1-selinux-contexts.patch\n    Additional changes to set the proper context during privilege\n    separation\n  * openssh-7.6p1-cleanup-selinux.patch\n    Various changes and putting the pieces together\n  For now we don't ship the ssh-keycat command, but we need the patch\n  for the other SELinux infrastructure\n  This change fixes issues like bsc#1214788, where the ssh daemon\n  needs to act on behalf of a user and needs a proper context for this\n\nPackage pam was updated:\n\n- Add missing O_DIRECTORY flag in `protect_dir()` for pam_namespace module.

This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage wicked was updated:\n\n- update to version 0.6.74  + team: add new options like link_watch_policy (jsc#PED-7183)\n  + Fix memory leaks in dbus variant destroy and fsm free (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1001)\n  + xpath: allow underscore in node identifier (gh#openSUSE/wicked#999)\n  + vxlan: don't format unknown rtnl attrs (bsc#1219751)\n- removed patches included in the source archive:\n  [- 0009-ifreload-VLAN-changes-require-device-deletion-bsc-12.patch]\n  [- 0008-ifcheck-fix-config-changed-check-bsc-1218926.patch]\n  [- 0007-Fix-ifstatus-exit-code-for-NI_WICKED_ST_NO_CARRIER-s.patch]\n  [- 0006-dhcp6-omit-the-SO_REUSEPORT-option-bsc-1215692.patch]\n  [- 0005-duid-fix-comment-for-v6time.patch]\n  [- 0004-rtnl-parse-peer-address-on-non-ptp-interfaces.patch]\n  [- 0003-rtnl-pass-ifname-in-newaddr-parsing-and-logging.patch]\n  [- 0002-system-updater-Parse-updater-format-from-XML-configu.patch]\n  [- 0001-fix_arp_notify_loop_and_burst_sending.patch]\n\n- ifreload: VLAN changes require device deletion (bsc#1218927)\n  [+ 0009-ifreload-VLAN-changes-require-device-deletion-bsc-12.patch]\n- ifcheck: fix config changed check (bsc#1218926)\n  [+ 0008-ifcheck-fix-config-changed-check-bsc-1218926.patch]\n- client: fix exit code for no-carrier status (bsc#1219265)\n  [+ 0007-Fix-ifstatus-exit-code-for-NI_WICKED_ST_NO_CARRIER-s.patch]\n- dhcp6: omit the SO_REUSEPORT option (bsc#1215692)\n  [+ 0006-dhcp6-omit-the-SO_REUSEPORT-option-bsc-1215692.patch]\n- duid: fix comment for v6time\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/989)\n  [+ 0005-duid-fix-comment-for-v6time.patch]\n- rtnl: fix peer address parsing for non ptp-interfaces\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/987,\n  https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/988)\n  [+ 0003-rtnl-pass-ifname-in-newaddr-parsing-and-logging.patch]\n  [+ 0004-rtnl-parse-peer-address-on-non-ptp-interfaces.patch]\n- system-updater: Parse updater format from XML configuration to\n  ensure install calls can run.\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/985)\n  [+ 0002-system-updater-Parse-updater-format-from-XML-configu.patch]\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n- Fix search/info commands ignoring --ignore-unknown (bsc#1217593)  The switch makes search commands return 0 rather than 104 for\n  empty search results.\n- version 1.14.68\n\n- patch: Make sure reboot-needed is remembered until next boot\n  (bsc#1217873)\n- version 1.14.67\n\n",

      "Description": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.
