      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: do not perform operations on net devices being unregistered\n\nThere is a short period between a net device starts to be unregistered\nand when it is actually gone. In that time frame ethtool operations\ncould still be performed, which might end up in unwanted or undefined\nbehaviours[1].\n\nDo not allow ethtool operations after a net device starts its\nunregistration. This patch targets the netlink part as the ioctl one\nisn't affected: the reference to the net device is taken and the\noperation is executed within an rtnl lock section and the net device\nwon't be found after unregister.\n\n[1] For example adding Tx queues after unregister ends up in NULL\n    pointer exceptions and UaFs, such as:\n\n      BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in kobject_get+0x14/0x90\n      Read of size 1 at addr ffff88801961248c by task ethtool/755\n\n      CPU: 0 PID: 755 Comm: ethtool Not tainted 5.15.0-rc6+ #778\n      Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-4.fc34 04/014\n      Call Trace:\n       dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x72\n       print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1f/0x140\n       kasan_report.cold+0x7f/0x11b\n       kobject_get+0x14/0x90\n       kobject_add_internal+0x3d1/0x450\n       kobject_init_and_add+0xba/0xf0\n       netdev_queue_update_kobjects+0xcf/0x200\n       netif_set_real_num_tx_queues+0xb4/0x310\n       veth_set_channels+0x1c3/0x550\n       ethnl_set_channels+0x524/0x610",
