Fixes\n  bsc#1229449:\n  * fix-x11-regression-bsc1229449.patch\n- Add a openssl11 bcond to the spec file for the SLE12 case\n  instead of checking suse_version in different parts.\n- Move conditional patches to a number \u0026gt;= 1000.\n- Several spec file fixes so the package builds and can be\n  installed in SLE 15 SP5 and SLE 12 SP5\n- Drop most of openssh-6.6p1-keycat.patch (actually, it was just\n  commented out). The keycat binary isn't really installed nor\n  supported, so we can drop it, except for the code that is used\n  by other SELinux patches, which is what I kept from that patch\n  (boo#1229072).\n- Add patch submitted to upstream to fix RFC4256 implementation\n  so that keyboard-interactive authentication method can send\n  instructions and sshd shows them to users even before a prompt\n  is requested. This fixes MFA push notifications (boo#1229010).\n  * 0001-auth-pam-Immediately-report-instructions-to-clients-and-fix-handling-in-ssh-client.patch\n- Fix a dbus connection leaked in the logind patch that was\n  missing a sd_bus_unref call (found by Matthias Gerstner):\n  * logind_set_tty.patch\n- Add a patch that fixes a small memory leak when parsing the\n  subsystem configuration option:\n  * fix-memleak-in-process_server_config_line_depth.patch\n\nPackage samba was updated:\n\n- Update to 4.19.9  * libldb: performance issue with indexes (ldb 2.8.2 is already\n    released); (bso#15590).\n  * DH reconnect error handling can lead to stale sharemode\n    entries; (bso#15624).\n  * Incorrect FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES response when\n    truncated; (bso#15699).\n  * irpc_destructor may crash during shutdown; (bso#15280).\n  * Compound SMB2 requests don't return\n    NT_STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED for all requests, confuses\n    MacOSX clients; (bso#15696).\n  * Crash when readlinkat fails; (bso#15700).\n\n-  Adjust spec to split out rpcd_* binaries into a separate\n  sub package; (bsc#1231414).\n\nPackage shared-mime-info was updated:\n\n- Uninstall silently if update-mime-database is not present  (bsc#1231463).\n\nPackage socat was updated:\n\n- Security fix for readline.sh: arbitrary file overwrite (bsc#1225462)  - add CVE-2024-54661.patch\n\nPackage suseconnect-ng was updated:\n\n- Update version to 1.13:  - Integrating uptime-tracker\n  - Honor auto-import-gpg-keys flag on migration (bsc#1231328)\n  - Only send labels if targetting SCC\n  - Skip the docker auth generation on RMT (bsc#1231185)\n  - Add --set-labels to register command to set labels at registration time on SCC\n  - Add a new function to display suse-uptime-tracker version\n  - Integrate with uptime-tracker ( https://github.com/SUSE/uptime-tracker/ )\n  - Add a command to show the info being gathered\n\nPackage wget was updated:\n\n- Drop support for shorthand URLs  * Breaking change to fix CVE-2024-10524.\n  [+ drop-support-for-shorthand-URLs.patch, bsc#1233773]\n\nPackage xen was updated:\n\n- bsc#1232622 - VUL-0: CVE-2024-45818: xen: Deadlock in x86 HVM  standard VGA handling (XSA-463)\n  xsa463-01.patch\n  xsa463-02.patch\n  xsa463-03.patch\n  xsa463-04.patch\n  xsa463-05.patch\n  xsa463-06.patch\n  xsa463-07.patch\n  xsa463-08.patch\n  xsa463-09.patch\n- bsc#1232624 - VUL-0: CVE-2024-45819: xen: libxl leaks data to PVH\n  guests via ACPI tables (XSA-464)\n  xsa464.patch\n- Drop stdvga-cache.patch\n\n- bsc#1232542 - remove usage of net-tools-deprecated from supportconfig plugin\n\n- bsc#1230366 - VUL-0: CVE-2024-45817: xen: x86: Deadlock in\n  vlapic_error() (XSA-462)\n  66f2af41-x86-vLAPIC-undue-recursion-of-vlapic_error.patch\n  Drop xsa462.patch\n- Upstream bug fixes (bsc#1027519)\n  66cf737b-x86-Dom0-disable-SMAP-for-PV-only.patch\n  66d6dca8-libxl-nul-termination-in-xen_console_read_line.patch\n  66d8690f-SUPPORT-split-XSM-from-Flask.patch\n  66e29480-x86-HVM-properly-reject-indirect-VRAM-writes.patch\n  66e44ae2-x86-ucode-AMD-buffer-underrun.patch\n  66f2fd92-x86-ucode-Intel-stricter-sanity-check.patch\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n- Don't try to download missing raw metadata if cache is not  writable (bsc#1225451)\n- man: Update 'search' command description.\n  Hint to \u0026quot;se -v\u0026quot; showing the matches within the packages metadata.\n  Explain that search strings starting with a \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; will implicitly\n  look into the filelist as well.

      "Description": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

Furthermore, the OS\ncan opt to receive an interrupt when a new error occurs.\n\nIt is possible to configure the error interrupt with an illegal vector,\nwhich generates an error when an error interrupt is raised.\n\nThis case causes Xen to recurse through vlapic_error().

      "Description": "The hypervisor contains code to accelerate VGA memory accesses for HVM\nguests, when the (virtual) VGA is in \"standard\" mode.  Locking involved\nthere has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the\nreturn from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a\nproblem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of\nwhich touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't\nrelevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already\nbeing held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a\ndeadlock.\n\nThis deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but\nwas analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light\nof the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking\ndiscipline work.\n\nIn staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered\nto be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the\nlocking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note\nthat even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired\nfor any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.",
