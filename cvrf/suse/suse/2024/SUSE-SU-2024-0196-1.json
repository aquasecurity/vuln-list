trying native histograms already, we recommend you\n  remove the `wal` directory when upgrading.\n  Because the old WAL record for native histograms is not\n  backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data\n  loss for the latest data.\n  Additionally, if you scrape 'float histograms' or use recording\n  rules on native histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float\n  histograms), it is a one-way street since older versions do not\n  support float histograms.\n  * [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format for the\n    experimental native histograms.\n  * [FEATURE] Add

retention policy is not breaking\n      anything. We will make sure to use the actual default\n      retention policy under the hood. To change the hardcoded\n      retention policy in the dashboard.json, users must they\n      select the right retention policy from dropdown and save the\n      panel/dashboard.\n    - Grafana Alerting rules with NoDataState configuration set to\n      Alerting will now respect 'For' duration.\n    - Users who use LDAP role sync to only sync Viewer, Editor and\n      Admin roles, but grant Grafana Server Admin role manually\n      will not be able to do that anymore. After this change, LDAP\n      role sync will override any manual changes to Grafana Server\n      Admin role assignments. If grafana_admin is left unset in\n      LDAP role mapping configuration, it will default to false.\n    API keys: Add deprecation to api keys.\n    API: Enable serving Swagger UI by default and add

toggle.\n    Security: Fixes for CVE-2023-1410.\n    The InfluxDB backend migration feature toggle\n    (influxdbBackendMigration) has been reintroduced in this\n    version as issues were discovered with backend processing of\n    InfluxDB data. Unless this feature toggle is enabled, all\n    InfluxDB data will be parsed in the frontend. This frontend\n    processing is the default behavior.\n    In Grafana 9.4.4, InfluxDB data parsing started to be handled\n    in the backend. If you have upgraded to 9.4.4 and then added\n    new transformations on InfluxDB data, those panels will fail to\n    render. To resolve this either:\n    Remove the affected panel and re-create it or\n    edit the `time` field as `Time` in `panel.json` or\n    `dashboard.json`\n  as the exporter toolkit has been updated by upstream\n- Install wrapper scripts under /usr/sbin\n- Install actual binaries under /usr/libexec/grafana (or /usr/lib\n  under older distributions) and create a simlink for wrapper\n  scripts and the service (which expect the binary to be under\n  /usr/share/grafana/bin)\n- Update to 9.4.3\n    Alerting: Use background context for maintenance function.\n- Update to 9.4.2\n    Alerting: Fix boolean

and will be\n      removed in a future release. Until then, when navigating to\n      Explore using the deprecated format the URLs are\n      automatically converted. If you have existing links pointing\n      to Explore update them using the format generated by Explore\n      upon navigation. You can identify a compact URL by its\n      format. Compact URLs have the left (and optionally right) url\n      parameter as an array of strings, for example\n      `\u0026left=['now-1h','now'...]`. The standard explore URLs follow\n      a key/value pattern, for example\n      `\u0026left={'datasource':'test'...}`. Please be sure to check\n      your dashboards for any hardcoded links to Explore and update\n      them to the standard URL pattern.\n- Update to 9.0.0\n    API: Add GET

CopyButton on KeyValueTables and\n            overlapping of panels.\n    `setExploreQueryField`, `setExploreMetricsQueryField` and\n      `setExploreLogsQueryField` are now deprecated and will be\n      removed in a future release. If you need to set a different\n      query editor for Explore, conditionally render based on\n      `props.app` in your regular query editor.\n    Chore: Remove react-testing-lib from bundles.\n    Select: Portal menu by default.\n    The `@grafana/ui` package helper function\n      `selectOptionInTest` used in frontend tests has been removed\n      as it caused testing libraries to be bundled in the\n      production code of Grafana. If you were using this helper\n      function in your tests please update your code accordingly:\n      ```js\n      // before\n      import { selectOptionInTest } from '@grafana/ui';\n      // ...test usage\n      await selectOptionInTest(selectEl, 'Option 2');\n      // after\n      import { select } from 'react-select-event';\n      await select(selectEl, 'Option 2',\n        { container: document.body });\n      ```\n    Removed deprecated `checkHealth` prop from the `@grafana/e2e`\n      `addDataSource` config. Previously this value defaulted to\n      `false`, and has not been used in end-to-end tests since\n      Grafana 8.0.3.\n    Removes the deprecated `LegacyBaseMap`, `LegacyValueMapping`,\n      `LegacyValueMap`, and `LegacyRangeMap` types, and\n      `getMappedValue` function from grafana-data. Migration is as\n      follows:\n      | Old                  | New                     |\n      | -------------------- | ----------------------- |\n      | `LegacyBaseMap`      | `MappingType`           |\n      | `LegacyValueMapping` | `ValueMapping`          |\n      | `LegacyValueMap`     | `ValueMap`              |\n      | `LegacyRangeMap`     | `RangeMap`              |\n      | `getMappedValue`     | `getValueMappingResult` |\n      This change fixes a bug in Grafana where intermittent failure\n      of database, network between Grafana and the database, or\n      error in querying the database would cause all alert rules to\n      be unscheduled in Grafana. Following this change scheduled\n      alert rules are not updated unless the query is successful.\n    The `get_alert_rules_duration_seconds` metric has been\n      renamed to `schedule_query_alert_rules_duration_seconds`.\n    Any secret (data sources credential, alert manager\n      credential, etc, etc) created or modified with Grafana v9.0\n      won't be decryptable from any previous version (by default)\n      because the way encrypted secrets are stored into the\n      database has changed. Although secrets created or modified\n      with previous versions will still be decryptable by Grafana\n      v9.0.\n    If required, although generally discouraged, the\n      `disableEnvelopeEncryption` feature toggle can be enabled to\n      keep envelope encryption disabled once updating to Grafana\n    In case of need to rollback to an earlier version of Grafana\n      (i.e. Grafana v8.x) for any reason, after being created or\n      modified any secret with Grafana v9.0, the\n      `envelopeEncryption` feature toggle will need to be enabled\n      to keep backwards compatibility (only from `v8.3.x` a bit\n      unstable, from `8.5.x` stable).\n    As a final attempt to deal with issues related with the\n      aforementioned situations, the `grafana-cli admin\n      secrets-migration rollback` command has been designed to\n      move back all the Grafana secrets encrypted with envelope\n      encryption to legacy encryption. So, after running that\n      command it should be safe to disable envelope encryption\n      and/or roll back to a previous version of Grafana.\n    Alternatively or complementarily to all the points above,\n      backing up the Grafana database before updating could be a\n      good idea to prevent disasters (although the risk of getting\n      some secrets corrupted only applies to those updates/created\n      with after updating to Grafana v9.0).\n    According to the dynamic labels documentation, you can use up\n      to five dynamic values per label. There’s currently no such\n      restriction in the alias pattern system, so if more than 5\n      patterns are being used the GetMetricData API will return an\n      error.\n    Dynamic labels only allow \\${LABEL} to be used once per\n      query. There’s no such restriction in the alias pattern\n      system, so in case more than 1 is being used the\n      GetMetricData API will return an error.\n    When no alias is provided by the user, Grafana will no longer\n      fallback with custom rules for naming the legend.\n    In case a search expression is being used and no data is\n      returned, Grafana will no longer expand dimension values, for\n      instance when using a multi-valued template variable or star\n      wildcard `*` in the dimension value field.\n    Time series might be displayed in a different order. Using\n      for example the dynamic label `${PROP('MetricName')}`, might\n      have the consequence that the time series are returned in a\n      different order compared to when the alias pattern\n      `{{metric}}` is used\n    In Elasticsearch, browser access mode was deprecated in\n      grafana 7.4.0 and removed in 9.0.0. If you used this mode,\n      please switch to server access mode on the datasource\n      configuration page.\n    Environment variables passed from Grafana to external Azure\n      plugins have been renamed:\n      `AZURE_CLOUD` renamed to `GFAZPL_AZURE_CLOUD`\n      `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ENABLED` renamed to\n        `GFAZPL_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ENABLED`\n      `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` renamed to\n        `GFAZPL_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`\n    There are no known plugins which were relying on these\n      variables. Moving forward plugins should read Azure settings\n      only via Grafana Azure SDK which properly handles old and new\n      environment variables.\n    Removes support for for ElasticSearch versions after their\n      end-of-life, currently versions \u003c 7.10.0. To continue to use\n      ElasticSearch data source, upgrade ElasticSearch to version\n      7.10.0+.\n    Application Insights and Insight Analytics queries in Azure\n      Monitor were deprecated in Grafana 8.0 and finally removed in\n      9.0. Deprecated queries will no longer be executed.\n    grafana/ui: Button now specifies a default type='button'\n      The `Button` component provided by @grafana/ui now specifies\n      a default `type='button'` when no type is provided.\n      In previous versions, if the attribute was not specified for\n      buttons associated with a `\u003cform\u003e` the default value was\n      `submit` per the specification. You can preserve the old\n      behavior by explicitly setting the type attribute:\n      `\u003cButton type='submit' /\u003e`\n    The `Rename by regex` transformation has been improved to\n      allow global patterns of the form `/\u003cstringToReplace\u003e/g`.\n      Depending on the regex match used, this may cause some\n      transformations to behave slightly differently. You can\n      guarantee the same behaviour as before by wrapping the\n      `match` string in forward slashes (`/`), e.g. `(.*)` would\n      become `/(.*)/`\n    `\u003cSelect /\u003e` menus will now portal to the document body by\n      default. This is to give more consistent behaviour when\n      positioning and overlaying. If you were setting\n      `menuShouldPortal={true}` before you can safely remove that\n      prop and behaviour will be the same. If you weren't\n      explicitly setting that prop, there should be no visible\n      changes in behaviour but your tests may need updating. If you\n      were setting `menuShouldPortal={false}` this will continue to\n      prevent the menu from portalling.\n    Grafana alerting endpoint prefixed with `api/v1/rule/test`\n      that tests a rule against a Corte/Loki data source now\n      expects the data source UID as a path parameter instead of\n      the data source numeric identifier.\n    Grafana alerting endpoints prefixed with `api/prometheus/`\n      that proxy requests to a Cortex/Loki data source now expect\n      the data source UID as a path parameter instead of the data\n      source numeric identifier.\n    Grafana alerting endpoints prefixed with `api/ruler/` that\n      proxy requests to a Cortex/Loki data source now expect the\n      data source UID as a path parameter instead of the data\n    Grafana alerting endpoints prefixed with `api/alertmanager/`\n      that proxy requests to an Alertmanager now expect the data\n      source UID as a path parameter instead of the data source\n      numeric identifier.\n    The format of log messages have been updated, `lvl` is now\n      `level` and `eror`and `dbug` has been replaced with `error`\n      and `debug`. The precision of timestamps has been increased.\n      To smooth the transition, it is possible to opt-out of the\n      new log format by enabling the feature toggle `oldlog`.\n      This option will be removed in a future minor release.\n    In the Loki data source, the dataframe format used to\n      represent Loki logs-data has been changed to a more efficient\n      format. The query-result is represented by a single dataframe\n      with a 'labels' column, instead of the separate dataframes\n      for every labels-value. When displaying such data in explore,\n      or in a logs-panel in the dashboard will continue to work\n      without changes, but if the data was loaded into a different\n      dashboard-panel, or Transforms were used, adjustments may be\n      necessary. For example, if you used the 'labels to fields'\n      transformation with the logs data, please switch to the\n      'extract fields' transformation.\n- Update to version 8.5.22:\n  * Fix XSS in

Issue\n    #47473 The change in behavior is that negative-valued series\n    are now stacked downwards from 0 (in their own stacks), rather\n    than downwards from the top of the positive stacks. We now\n    automatically group stacks by Draw style, Line interpolation,\n    and Bar alignment, making it impossible to stack bars on top of\n    lines, or smooth lines on top of stepped lines. Issue #47373\n    The meaning of the default data source has now changed from\n    being a persisted property in a panel. Before when you selected\n    the default data source for a panel and later changed the\n    default data source to another data source it would change all\n    panels who were configured to use the default data source. From\n    now on the default data source is just the default for new\n    panels and changing the default will not impact any currently\n    saved dashboards.

      "Description": "In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).",

In affected versions if an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser. The user visiting the malicious link must be unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu bar. The url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }} ex: {{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}. When the user follows the link and the page renders, the login button will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression contained in the URL. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string {{ in the path.",

      "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and 9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG files weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include either an external URL to a SVG-file containing JavaScript, or use the `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG-file containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.16, 9.2.10, or 9.3.4 to receive a fix.",

The vulnerability present starting with version 7.4.0-beta1 and prior to versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 allows someone to bypass these security configurations if a malicious datasource (running on an allowed host) returns an HTTP redirect to a forbidden host. The vulnerability only impacts Grafana Enterprise when the Request security allow list is used and there is a possibility to add a custom datasource to Grafana which returns HTTP redirects. In this scenario, Grafana would blindly follow the redirects and potentially give secure information to the clients. Grafana Cloud is not impacted by this vulnerability. Versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.",

      "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.",

In versions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as the migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.",

      "Description": "Grafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics, logs, and traces. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user’s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, the login system allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’s email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.",

When another user opens the URL of the snapshot, they will be presented with the regular web interface delivered by the trusted Grafana server. The `Open original dashboard` button no longer points to the to the real original dashboard but to the attacker’s injected URL. This issue is fixed in versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8.",
