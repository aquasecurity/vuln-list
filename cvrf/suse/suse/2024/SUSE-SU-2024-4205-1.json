      "Text": "This update for docker-stable fixes the following issues:\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n- Update --add-runtime to point to correct binary path.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u003chttps://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u003e\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. bsc#1231348\n\n- Import specfile changes for docker-buildx as well as the changes to help\n  reduce specfile differences between docker-stable and docker. bsc#1230331\n  bsc#1230333\n\n- Backport patch for CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n\n- Initial docker-stable release, forked from Docker 24.0.6-ce release\n  (packaged on 2023-10-11).\n\n- Update to Docker 24.0.9-ce, which is the latest version of the 24.0.x branch.\n  It seems likely this will be the last upstream version of the 24.0.x branch\n  (it seems Mirantis is going to do LTS for 23.0.x, not 24.0.x).\n  \u003chttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/24.0/#2409\u003e\n- Fix BuildKit's symlink resolution logic to correctly handle non-lexical\n  symlinks. Backport of \u003chttps://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/4896\u003e and\n  \u003chttps://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/5060\u003e. bsc#1221916\n- Write volume options atomically so sudden system crashes won't result in\n  future Docker starts failing due to empty files. Backport of\n  \u003chttps://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48034\u003e. bsc#1214855\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-41110",
      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.",
