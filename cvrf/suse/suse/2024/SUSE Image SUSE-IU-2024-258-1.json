This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage sudo was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1219026, bsc#1220389, CVE-2023-42465]  * Try to make sudo less vulnerable to ROWHAMMER attacks.\n  * Add sudo-CVE-2023-42465-1of2.patch sudo-CVE-2023-42465-2of2.patch\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update to version 10.1.7 (bsc#1220164, bsc#1220165)  + Fix the failover path to a new target update server. At present a new\n    server is not found since credential validation fails. We targeted\n    the server detected in down condition to verify the credentials instead\n    of the replacement server.\n\nPackage docker was updated:\n\n- Vendor latest buildkit v0.11:  Add patch 0006-Vendor-in-latest-buildkit-v0.11-branch-including-CVE.patch that\n  vendors in the latest v0.11 buildkit branch including bugfixes for the following:\n  * bsc#1219438: CVE-2024-23653\n  * bsc#1219268: CVE-2024-23652\n  * bsc#1219267: CVE-2024-23651\n- rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n- switch from %patchN to %patch -PN syntax\n- remove unused rpmlint filters and add filters to silence pointless bash \u0026amp; zsh\n  completion warnings\n\nPackage _product:SLES-release was updated:\n\nPackage openssh was updated:\n\n- remember the enabled state of sshd state, so openssh8,4 can pick it  up. bsc#1220110\n\n- Added openssh-cve-2023-51385.patch (bsc#1218215, CVE-2023-51385).\n  This limits the use of shell metacharacters in host- and\n  user names.\n\nPackage grub2 was updated:\n\n- Make consistent check to enable relative path on btrfs (bsc#1174567) (bsc#1216912)  * 0001-Unify-the-check-to-enable-btrfs-relative-path.patch\n\n",

Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id has.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

      "Description": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.
