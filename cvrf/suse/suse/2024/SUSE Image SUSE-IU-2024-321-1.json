The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., \u003e 32), then drop the connection.",

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.
