Fix.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/perf-Fix-perf_event_validate_size-lockdep-splat.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/perf-Fix-perf_event_validate_size.patch.\n- commit 3382aa6\n\n- MyBS: Fix the logic of the wipe conditional.\n  - with no_init specified leave the built packages\n  - with multibuild the package may be present even if build is not\n  enabled, delete anyway\n- commit 9c2f303\n\n- mkspec: Add multibuild support (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  When MULTIBUILD option in config.sh is enabled generate a _multibuild\n  file listing all spec files.\n- commit f734347\n\n- Build in the correct KOTD repository with multibuild\n  (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  With multibuild setting repository flags is no longer supported for\n  individual spec files - see\n  https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/3574\n  Add ExclusiveArch conditional that depends on a macro set up by\n  bs-upload-kernel instead. With that each package should build only in\n  one repository - either standard or QA.\n  Note: bs-upload-kernel does not interpret rpm conditionals, and only\n  uses the first ExclusiveArch line to determine the architectures to\n  enable.\n- commit aa5424d\n\n- bs-upload-kernel, MyBS, Buildresults: Support multibuild\n  (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n- strip package name prefix when recording results\n- add package prefix to linked packages\n- when _multibuild file is present do not link packages\n- use onlybuild BuildFlag for limiting build to specific packages\n- generate is_kotd_qa macro in project config that can be used to\n  determine if the package is built in the QA repository\n  This is _very_ convoluted. No shell or lua tools can be used because\n  this information needs to be available to the OBS to schedule the\n  package in the correct repository, and it does not run scripts. The\n  builtin sub macro for slicing strings causes a build error - it\n  expanded correctly by the scheduler but not available at package build\n  time. If conditional cannot be used because rpm macros from project\n  config are added to a macro include file, and those do not support\n  conditionals. That leaves the option to use an expression that\n  explicitly enumerates all QA repository names. This requires unusal\n  and convoluted check in the spec file to make use of.\n- commit 747f601\n\n- MyBS: create_package: Specify package should build in QA repository\n  by argument (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  Drop the unused title and description arguments, move the package name\n  match to upload_package and pass teh result, add additional argument for\n  multibuild.\n- commit a355e71\n\n- bs-upload-kernel: Wipe kernel-obs-build before upload\n  (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  The kernel upload takes long enough for packages to start building\n  during the upload. If the project contains kernel-obs-build binary that\n  crashes on boot builds fail as a result. Wipe kernel-obs-build before\n  the upload. Handle the case when the package does not exist yet by\n  ignoring the error.\n- commit cdac4cc\n\n- bs-upload-kernel: Use one package list (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  There were ultiple package lists passed to upload_package supporting the\n  distinction between package names starting with kernel- which can be\n  individually selected for build, and other packages. Pass only one\n  package list to simplify the logic and make it possible to know the full\n  package list before doing the upload.\n- commit ec941eb\n\n- bs-upload-kernel: Support package limit for non-kernel packages\n  (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  The -f option of the bs-upload-kernel script adds kernel- prefix\n  unconditionally the package name.\n  List all spec files in the uploaded directory, and check if the package\n  exists with or without the kernel- prefix.\n- commit 354b77b\n\n- bs-upload-kernel: Drop BS_SUFFIX (JSC-SLE#5501, boo#1211226, bsc#1218184)\n  BS_SUFFIX was used by SLE12 SP1 for Arm. This release is no longer\n  maintained, and this feature gets no testing.\n  Substantial changes to this script are required, and it's unlikely this\n  feture would keep working after that.\n- commit e27b306\n\n- blacklist.conf: Add 1ca0b6051505 cgroup: Remove duplicates in cgroup v1 tasks file\n- commit a77e914\n\n- blacklist.conf: add non-backport commits of git-fixes\n- commit 4d91f49\n\n-

config-options.changes (jsc#PED-5021)\n  The file doc/config-options.changes was used in the past to document\n  kernel config changes. It was introduced in 2010 but haven't received\n  any updates on any branch since 2015. The file is renamed by tar-up.sh\n  to config-options.changes.txt and shipped in the kernel-source RPM\n  package under /usr/share/doc. As its content now only contains outdated\n  information, retaining it can lead to confusion for users encountering\n  this file.\n  Config changes are nowadays described in associated Git commit messages,\n  which get automatically collected and are incorporated into changelogs\n  of kernel RPM packages.\n  Drop then this obsolete file, starting with its packaging logic.\n  For branch maintainers: Upon merging this commit on your branch, please\n  correspondingly delete the file doc/config-options.changes.\n- commit adedbd2\n\n- README.md: Make a few polishing changes (jsc#PED-5021)\n  * Move @suse.com address at the front of SUSE email domains, as that is\n  the one that should be normally used for contributions, according to\n  the current SUSE Open Source Policy.\n  * Avoid repeatedly using \u0026quot;please\u0026quot; in two consecutive sentences.\n  * Fix a typo in section \u0026quot;Patch sorting\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;commit\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; \u0026quot;commits\u0026quot;.\n  * Prefix relative commands in section \u0026quot;Config option changes\u0026quot; with \u0026quot;./\u0026quot;\n  even if they are from a subdirectory, for consistency with the rest of\n  the document.\n  * Turn \u0026quot;Related information\u0026quot; into a proper list.\n- commit 7c8a1e3\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Simplify the list of references (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Reduce indentation in the list of references, make the style consistent\n  with README.md.\n- commit 70e3c33\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Add how to update the config for module signing\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Configuration files for SUSE kernels include settings to integrate with\n  signing support provided by the Open Build Service. This creates\n  problems if someone tries to use such a configuration file to build\n  a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; kernel as described in doc/README.SUSE:\n  * Default configuration files available in the kernel-source repository\n  unset CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL to leave module signing to\n  pesign-obs-integration. In case of a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; build, this\n  integration is not available and the modules don't get signed.\n  * The kernel spec file overrides CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to\n  \u0026quot;.kernel_signing_key.pem\u0026quot; which is a file populated by certificates\n  provided by OBS but otherwise not available. The value ends up in\n  /boot/config-$VERSION-$RELEASE-$FLAVOR and /proc/config.gz. If someone\n  decides to use one of these files as their base configuration then the\n  build fails with an error because the specified module signing key is\n  missing.\n  Add information on how to enable module signing and where to find the\n  relevant upstream documentation.\n- commit a699dc3\n\n- net/ulp: use consistent error code when blocking ULP\n  (CVE-2023-0461 bsc#1208787 bsc#1217079).\n- net/ulp: prevent ULP without clone op from entering the LISTEN\n  status (CVE-2023-0461 bsc#1208787 bsc#1217079).\n- commit fb04b97\n\n- scripts: Install pre-merge-commit hook\n  When merge is not carried out with `--no-commit` or it does not yield in\n  a conflict, our standard pre-commit checks are omitted.\n  Rectify that by invoking pre-commit hook via pre-merge-commit too.\n- commit 87067a7\n\n- scripts: pre-commit: Check newly added blacklist.conf entries\n  When blacklist.conf entries are added by merging an \u0026quot;upstream\u0026quot; branch,\n  they are not checked against present commits and the repo ends up in\n  inconsistent state when the patch is present and blacklisted at the same\n  time.\n  The state is checked in pre-commit hook when a (blacklisted) patch is\n  added. Prevent reaching this state when adding blacklist.conf entries\n  too.\n  Using scripts/check-patch-blacklist for this check would be\n  prohibitively slow (~5 minutes with 40k patches).\n- commit 1f68a01\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Remove how to build modules using kernel-source\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Remove the first method how to build kernel modules from the readme. It\n  describes a process consisting of the kernel-source installation,\n  configuring this kernel and then performing an ad-hoc module build.\n  This method is not ideal as no modversion data is involved in the\n  process.

Remove any mention of symbol sets.\n- commit 61dabdd\n\n- README: Update the Kernel ABI Changes section (jsc#PED-5021)\n  * Add a short description about stable kABI to give readers more\n  context.\n  * Rework the main part of the section to reflect that the ABI reference\n  is stored in symvers and symtypes files, applies to SLE12 onwards.\n  * Adjust the update-symvers example to note that in order to update both\n  reference files, one has to pass to the script the default and devel\n  packages for a respective kernel.\n  * Drop the second update-symvers example which mentions use of --filter\n  because the option should not be generally very useful to most people.\n  * Update the note about who should update the kabi files to say that it\n  should be branch maintainers.\n- commit 1d97539\n\n- scripts/CKC: fixed iterating over an array + skip unrecognized options\n- 182c5295bfe1 introduced option parsing which unfotunately broke\n  iterating over the terms since it changed the type of KBC_CHECK_TERMS\n  from a string (of space separated tokens) to a proper bash array\n  which requires a different method of iteration.\n- With different version of the script flying around it's better to\n  skip unrecognized options so that they are not mistaken for terms to\n  search for, one can always force them after '--'.\n- commit f0ca120\n\n- README: Update the What Is The Kernel ABI? section (jsc#PED-5021)\n  * Remove long obsolete information about \u0026quot;kernel(...)\u0026quot; per-class RPM\n  dependencies and replace it with information about \u0026quot;ksym(...)\u0026quot;\n  per-symbol entries.\n  * Simplify structure of the text.\n- commit 7a70ee0\n\n- README: Update the Committing and Log Messages section (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Rework the section to reflect that RPM changelogs are nowadays produces\n  directly from a Git log.\n- commit 2dcbfb9\n\n- scripts/CKC: add -c (--color) and -C (--Color) options\n  - c turns on colored results unconditionally.\n  - C turns on colored results if and only if the STDOUT is connected to\n  the terminal which is useful when piping the output somewhere.\n  Neither option is the default.\n  Color mapping:\n    ok = green\n    missing = red\n    partly = yellow\n    blacklisted = magenta\n  Example:\n    ./scripts/check-kernel-commit 559089e0a93d -c\n- commit 34a9cf5\n\n- xen/events: replace evtchn_rwlock with RCU (bsc#1215745,\n  xsa-441, cve-2023-34324).\n- commit a9545c4\n\n- README: Update the Config Option Changes section (jsc#PED-5021)\n  * Slightly improve wording in the section.\n  * Bump the example directory to SLE15-SP5 to match the previous update\n  to the Before you commit section.\n- commit 5494c94\n\n- README: Update the Before You Commit section (jsc#PED-5021)\n  * Prefix the example invocation of scripts/sequence-patch.sh with \u0026quot;./\u0026quot;\n  for consistency with the rest of the document.\n  * Update the example output from scripts/sequence-patch.sh to match the\n  regular invocation instead of the Rapidquilt case and bump the output\n  to SLE15-SP5.\n  * Drop the paragraph describing that a fix patch should be placed in\n  series.conf close to the patch which introduced the associated bug.\n  The current situation is that the patches should be sorted according\n  to the upstream order.\n  * Add a new paragraph describing use of scripts/sequence-patch.sh with\n  Rapidquilt.\n  * Fix typos, slightly improve wording and integrate some occurrences of\n  additional details in parentheses.\n- commit 05796c7\n\n- blacklist.conf: risky backport that doesn't fix any actual bug\n- commit 3d04b1a\n\n- s390/vdso: add missing FORCE to build targets (git-fixes\n  bsc#1216140).\n- commit cd866ae\n\n- blacklist.conf: does not really fix any bug\n- commit cba9926\n\n- blacklist.conf: changes exported symbol\n- commit d468872\n\n- README: Update the Patch Headers section (jsc#PED-5021)\n  * Fix typos, slightly improve some wording and avoid writing additional\n  details in parentheses.\n  * Remove \u0026quot;:\u0026quot; from the names of patch tags which appear in regular\n  sentences. The suffix is somewhat redundant and made README\n  inconsistent with doc/README.PATCH-POLICY.SUSE in this regard.\n  * Provide an updated example for the patch header format.

      "Description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nDH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of\nother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other\nfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n\n",
