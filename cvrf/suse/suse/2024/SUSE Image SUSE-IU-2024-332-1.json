f16fc26\n\n- compute-PATCHVERSION: Do not produce output when awk fails\n  compute-PATCHVERSION uses awk to produce a shell script that is\n  subsequently executed to update shell variables which are then printed\n  as the patchversion.\n  Some versions of awk, most notably bysybox-gawk do not understand the\n  awk program and fail to run. This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead.

This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage google-guest-oslogin was updated:\n\n- Add explicit versioned dependency on google-guest-agent (bsc#1219642)\n- Update to version 20231101.00 (bsc#1216548, bsc#1216750)\n  * Fix HTTP calls retry logic (#117)\n\n- Update to version 20231004\n  * packaging: Make the dependency explicit (#120)\n\n- update to 20230926.00:\n  * fix suse build\n  * selinux: fix selinux build (#114)\n  * test: align CXX Flags\n  * sshca: Make the implementation more C++ like\n  * sshca: Add a SysLog wrapper\n  * oslogin_utils: introduce AuthorizeUser() API\n  * sshca: move it out of pam dir\n  * pam: start disabling the use of oslogin_sshca\n  * sshca: consider sshca API to assume a cert only\n  * authorized principals: introduce the new command\n  * authorize keys: update to use new APIs\n  * pam modules: remove pam_*_admin and update pam_*_login\n  * cache_refresh: should be catching by reference.\n\n- Update to version 20230823.00\n  * selinux: Add sshd_key_t type enforcement to trusted user ca (#113)\n- from version 20230822.00\n  * sshca: Add tests with fingerprint and multiple extensions (#111)\n- from version 20230821.01\n  * sshca: Support method token and handle multi line (#109)\n- from version 20230821.00\n  * Update owners (#110)\n\n- Update to version 20230808.00\n  * byoid: extract and apply the ca fingerprint to policy call (#106)\n\n- Update to version 20230502.00\n  * Improve the URL in 2fa prompt (#104)\n- from version 20230406.02\n  * Check open files (#101)\n- from version 20230406.01\n  * Initialize variables (#100)\n  * Fix formatting (#102)\n- from version 20230406.00\n  * PAM cleanup: remove duplicates (#97)\n- from version 20230405.00\n  * NSS cleanup (#98)\n- from version 20230403.01\n  * Cleanup Makefiles (#95)\n- from version 20230403.00\n  * Add anandadalton to the owners list (#96)\n\n- Update to version 20230217.00\n  * Update OWNERS (#91)\n- from version 20230202.00\n  * Update owners file (#89)\n\n- Update to version 20220721.00 (bsc#1202100, bsc#1202101)\n  * prune outdated info from readme (#86)\n- from version 20220714.00\n  * strip json-c version symbol (#84)\n- from version 20220622.00\n  * pam login: split conditions for logging (#83)\n\n- use pam_moduledir (boo#1191036)\n  * Support UsrMerge project\n\n- Update to version 20220411.00\n  * pam login: split conditions for logging (#83)\n\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Add avahi-CVE-2023-38471.patch: Extract host name using  avahi_unescape_label (bsc#1216594, CVE-2023-38471).\n- Add avahi-CVE-2023-38469.patch: Reject overly long TXT resource\n  records (bsc#1216598, CVE-2023-38469).\n\nPackage python-base was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2023-27043-email-parsing-errors.patch to  gh#python/cpython!111116, fixing bsc#1210638 (CVE-2023-27043).\n\nPackage libssh was updated:\n\n- Update to 0.9.8: [jsc#PED-7719, bsc#1218126, CVE-2023-48795]  * Rebase 0001-disable-timeout-test-on-slow-buildsystems.patch\n  * Remove patches fixed in the update:\n  -

Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect\n\nhidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)\nraces when it races with itself.\n\nhidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs\non probe() and if a \"device-connected\" packet is received by the hw\nwhen the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on\nthe hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be\nstarted from the workqueue.\n\nThis opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):\n\n1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---",

The new value is tested for validity by\ntemporarily loading it into the fpc register.\n\nThis may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the host process:\nif an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc\nregister, and within interrupt context floating point or vector registers\nare used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with save_fpu_regs()\nassuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into fp/vx registers\nwhen returning to user space.\n\ntest_fp_ctl() restores the original user space / host process fpc register\nvalue, however it will be discarded, when returning to user space.\n\nIn result the host process will incorrectly continue to run with the value\nthat was supposed to be used for a guest cpu.\n\nFix this by simply removing the test. There is another test right before\nthe SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values.\n\nThis results in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be accepted\ninstead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be acceptable,\ngiven that this interface is most likely not used anymore, and this is in\naddition the same behaviour implemented with the memory mapped interface\n(replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs() in kvm-s390.c.",
