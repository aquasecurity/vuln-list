support status can be obtained at runtime for each\n  module from /sys/module/$MODULE/supported and for the entire system\n  from /sys/kernel/supported. This provides a way how to now check that\n  the kernel has any externally supported modules loaded.\n  * Remove a mention that externally supported modules taint the kernel,\n  but keep the information about bit 16 (X) and add a note that it is\n  still tracked per module and can be read from\n  /sys/module/$MODULE/taint. This per-module information also appears in\n  Oopses.\n- commit 9ed8107\n\n- btrfs: fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot\n  creation failure (bsc#1219126 CVE-2024-23850).\n- commit

This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead. That prevents printing the stale values, generates no\n  output, and generates invalid rpm spec file down the line. Then the\n  problem is flagged early and should be easier to diagnose.\n- commit 8ef8383\n\n- nvme: move nvme_stop_keep_alive() back to original position\n  (bsc#1211515).\n- commit b945fa0\n\n- x86/asm: Add _ASM_RIP() macro for x86-64 (%rip) suffix (git-fixes).\n- commit 636fc4c\n\n- KVM: VMX: Move VERW closer to VMentry for MDS mitigation (git-fixes).\n- KVM: VMX: Use BT+JNC, i.e. EFLAGS.CF to select VMRESUME vs. VMLAUNCH (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Use ALTERNATIVE() instead of mds_user_clear static key (git-fixes).\n  Also add the removed mds_user_clear symbol to kABI severities as it is\n  exposed just for KVM module and is generally a core kernel component so\n  removing it is low risk.\n- x86/entry_32: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Add asm helpers for executing VERW (git-fixes).\n- commit 5b0be3c\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: disallow rule removal from chain binding\n  (bsc#1218216 CVE-2023-5197).\n- commit d7a1a4d\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: skip bound chain in netns release path\n  (bsc#1218216 CVE-2023-5197).\n- commit af879c8\n\n- nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup (bsc#1211515).\n- commit 13f904b\n\n- net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv\n  (bsc#1219127 CVE-2024-23849).\n- commit 43577c1\n\n- kernel-binary: Move build script to the end\n  All other spec templates have the build script at the end, only\n  kernel-binary has it in the middle.

This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage util-linux-systemd was updated:\n\n- Properly neutralize escape sequences in wall  (util-linux-CVE-2024-28085.patch, bsc#1221831, CVE-2024-28085,\n  and its prerequisites: util-linux-fputs_careful1.patch,\n  util-linux-wall-migrate-to-memstream.patch\n  util-linux-fputs_careful2.patch).\n\n- Add upstream patch\n  more-exit-if-POLLERR-and-POLLHUP-on-stdin-is-received.patch\n  bsc#1220117 -

There will be a use-after-free on\nnet-\u003emib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net\nif there are some inflight time-wait timers.\n\nThis bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 (\"mib: add net to\nNET_ADD_STATS_BH\") since the net_statistics is a global variable\ninstead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit\n61a7e26028b9 (\"mib: put net statistics on struct net\") introduces\nthe bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it when\nnet namespace is destroyed.\n\nMoving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug\nand replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless\nwhen init_ipv4_mibs() fails.\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/g/syzkaller/c/p1tn-_Kc6l4/m/smuL_FMAAgAJ?pli=1",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots\n\nPrivileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack\nmemory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses\nwere permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state-\u003eallocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nIB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests\n\nhfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data\ncorruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs\nwhere an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page\nboundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a\n\nHere are the specific bugs:\n1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec-\u003eiov.iov_len.\n   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec\n   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past\n   iovec-\u003eiov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.\n2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the\n   next iovec in user_sdma_request-\u003eiovs when the current iovec\n   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the\n   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the\n   iovec pages.\n\nThis has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2\nbecause they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail\niovec of an SDMA request.\n\nFixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache\n(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests\nwith multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So\nthis commit fixes those issues as well.\n\nHere are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec\npayload user SDMA requests can hit:\n1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate\n   pinnings.\n2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),\n   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)\n   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock\n   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.\n\n   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)\n   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.\n\n   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the\n   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between\n   (2) and (3).\n3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount is\n   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler-\u003elock. As a result, mmu_rb_node\n   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler-\u003elock and\n   checks mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount before mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount is\n   incremented.\n4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not\n   check mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.\n\n   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have\n   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the\n   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests\n   complete.",

Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---",

Juhyung reported\nthat EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.\nAfter some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the new\nFSRM feature expose this issue with \"rep movsb\".\n\nLet's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace\ndecompression for now.  Later, as an useful improvement, we could try\nto tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.",
