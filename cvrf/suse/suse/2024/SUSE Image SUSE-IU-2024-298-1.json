compute-PATCHVERSION: Do not produce output when awk fails\n  compute-PATCHVERSION uses awk to produce a shell script that is\n  subsequently executed to update shell variables which are then printed\n  as the patchversion.\n  Some versions of awk, most notably bysybox-gawk do not understand the\n  awk program and fail to run. This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead. That prevents printing the stale values, generates no\n  output, and generates invalid rpm spec file down the line.

With that each package should build only in\n  one repository - either standard or QA.\n  Note: bs-upload-kernel does not interpret rpm conditionals, and only\n  uses the first ExclusiveArch line to determine the architectures to\n  enable.\n- commit aa5424d\n\n- blacklist.conf: Add c98c18270be1 sched, cgroup: Restore meaning to hierarchical_quota\n- commit 6115840\n\n- mm: kmem: drop __GFP_NOFAIL when allocating objcg vectors\n  (bsc#1218515).\n- commit 00f113e\n\n- blacklist.conf: e63a57303599 blk-cgroup: bypass blkcg_deactivate_policy after destroying\n- commit 895355e\n\n- ring-buffer: Fix slowpath of interrupted event (git-fixes).\n- commit dbe7edd\n\n- ring-buffer: Remove useless update to write_stamp in\n  rb_try_to_discard() (git-fixes).\n- commit 64ff947\n\n- RDMA/hfi1: Workaround truncation compilation error (git-fixes)\n- commit 2302fb3\n\n- RDMA/hns: The UD mode can only be configured with DCQCN (git-fixes)\n- commit ca9d38d\n\n- RDMA/hns: Add check for SL (git-fixes)\n- commit cf9e8e3\n\n- RDMA/hns: Fix signed-unsigned mixed comparisons (git-fixes)\n- commit 34178f4\n\n- RDMA/hns: Fix uninitialized ucmd in hns_roce_create_qp_common() (git-fixes)\n- commit 47c4074\n\n- RDMA/hns: Fix printing level of asynchronous events (git-fixes)\n- commit 892f8ec\n\n- IB/mlx5: Fix rdma counter binding for RAW QP (git-fixes)\n- commit ffaf04e\n\n- RDMA/hfi1: Use FIELD_GET() to extract Link Width (git-fixes)\n- commit 4b8aeed\n\n- RDMA/core: Use size_{add,sub,mul}() in calls to struct_size() (git-fixes)\n- commit 605983a\n\n- usb-storage: Add quirk for incorrect WP on Kingston DT Ultimate\n  3.0 G3 (git-fixes).\n- ALSA: usb-audio: Increase delay in MOTU M quirk (git-fixes).\n- ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for ASUS ROG GV302XA (git-fixes).\n- drm/i915: Reject async flips with bigjoiner (git-fixes).\n- Bluetooth: hci_event: shut up a false-positive warning\n  (git-fixes).\n- Bluetooth: Fix deadlock in vhci_send_frame (git-fixes).\n- wifi: mac80211: mesh: check element parsing succeeded\n  (git-fixes).\n- drm/amdgpu: fix tear down order in amdgpu_vm_pt_free\n  (git-fixes).\n- drm/i915: Fix intel_atomic_setup_scalers() plane_state handling\n  (git-fixes).\n- drm/i915: Fix remapped stride with CCS on ADL+ (git-fixes).\n- drm/mediatek: Add spinlock for setting vblank event in\n  atomic_begin (git-fixes).\n- drm/i915: Relocate intel_atomic_setup_scalers() (git-fixes).\n- drm/i915/dpt: Only do the POT stride remap when using DPT\n  (git-fixes).\n- drm/i915/mtl: limit second scaler vertical scaling in ver \u0026gt;=\n  14 (git-fixes).\n- commit 6c0ae87\n\n- drm/amdgpu/sdma5.2: add begin/end_use ring callbacks\n  (bsc#1212139).\n- commit a070291\n\n- Bluetooth: btusb: Add new PID/VID 0489:e0f2 for MT7921\n  (bsc#1218461).\n- commit 456e758\n\n- uapi: propagate __struct_group() attributes to the container\n  union (jsc#SLE-18978).\n- commit 3b553e2\n\n- dm verity: initialize fec io before freeing it (git-fixes).\n- dm-verity: don't use blocking calls from tasklets (git-fixes).\n- dm: don't attempt to queue IO under RCU protection (git-fixes).\n- null_blk: fix poll request timeout handling (git-fixes).\n- dm: verity-loadpin: Add NULL pointer check for 'bdev' parameter\n  (git-fixes).\n- dm: fix __send_duplicate_bios() to always allow for splitting IO\n  (bsc#1215952).\n- dm: fix improper splitting for abnormal bios (bsc#1215952).\n- md: select BLOCK_LEGACY_AUTOLOAD (git-fixes).\n- dm: add cond_resched() to dm_wq_requeue_work() (git-fixes).\n- commit 09d4263\n\n- Update References\n  patches.suse/Bluetooth-Reject-connection-with-the-device-which-ha.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1215237 CVE-2020-26555).\n- commit 0b8be40\n\n- Update References\n  patches.suse/Bluetooth-hci_event-Ignore-NULL-link-key.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1215237 CVE-2020-26555).\n- commit 3386934\n\n- iio: adc: ti_am335x_adc: Fix return value check of\n  tiadc_request_dma() (git-fixes).\n- iio: triggered-buffer: prevent possible freeing of wrong buffer\n  (git-fixes).\n- iio: imu: inv_mpu6050: fix an error code problem in\n  inv_mpu6050_read_raw (git-fixes).\n- iio: common: ms_sensors: ms_sensors_i2c: fix humidity conversion\n  time table (git-fixes).\n- interconnect: Treat xlate() returning NULL node as an error\n  (git-fixes).\n- Input: ipaq-micro-keys -

It was introduced in 2010 but haven't received\n  any updates on any branch since 2015. The file is renamed by tar-up.sh\n  to config-options.changes.txt and shipped in the kernel-source RPM\n  package under /usr/share/doc. As its content now only contains outdated\n  information, retaining it can lead to confusion for users encountering\n  this file.\n  Config changes are nowadays described in associated Git commit messages,\n  which get automatically collected and are incorporated into changelogs\n  of kernel RPM packages.\n  Drop then this obsolete file, starting with its packaging logic.\n  For branch maintainers: Upon merging this commit on your branch, please\n  correspondingly delete the file doc/config-options.changes.\n- commit adedbd2\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Simplify the list of references (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Reduce indentation in the list of references, make the style consistent\n  with README.md.\n- commit 70e3c33\n\n- regmap: fix bogus error on regcache_sync success (git-fixes).\n- platform/surface: aggregator: fix recv_buf() return value\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit e5d6930\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Add how to update the config for module signing\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Configuration files for SUSE kernels include settings to integrate with\n  signing support provided by the Open Build Service. This creates\n  problems if someone tries to use such a configuration file to build\n  a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; kernel as described in doc/README.SUSE:\n  * Default configuration files available in the kernel-source repository\n  unset CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL to leave module signing to\n  pesign-obs-integration. In case of a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; build, this\n  integration is not available and the modules don't get signed.\n  * The kernel spec file overrides CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to\n  \u0026quot;.kernel_signing_key.pem\u0026quot; which is a file populated by certificates\n  provided by OBS but otherwise not available. The value ends up in\n  /boot/config-$VERSION-$RELEASE-$FLAVOR and /proc/config.gz. If someone\n  decides to use one of these files as their base configuration then the\n  build fails with an error because the specified module signing key is\n  missing.\n  Add information on how to enable module signing and where to find the\n  relevant upstream documentation.\n- commit a699dc3\n\n- efi/unaccepted: Fix off-by-one when checking for overlapping\n  ranges (jsc#PED-7167).\n- commit cbbb7d9\n\n- blacklist.conf: Cleanup entries that are backported\n- commit d22e603\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Remove how to build modules using kernel-source\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Remove the first method how to build kernel modules from the readme. It\n  describes a process consisting of the kernel-source installation,\n  configuring this kernel and then performing an ad-hoc module build.\n  This method is not ideal as no modversion data is involved in the\n  process. It results in a module with no symbol CRCs which can be wrongly\n  loaded on an incompatible kernel.\n  Removing the method also simplifies the readme because only two main\n  methods how to build the modules are then described, either doing an\n  ad-hoc build using kernel-devel, or creating a proper Kernel Module\n  Package.\n- commit 9285bb8\n\n- blacklist.conf: just in case fix for a corner case\n- commit a3fc582\n\n- xhci: Clear EHB bit only at end of interrupt handler\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit d5adf2a\n\n- usb: config: fix iteration issue in 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()'\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 5cdcb2d\n\n- usb: host: xhci-plat: fix possible kernel oops while resuming\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit b0504f4\n\n- NFS: More fixes for nfs_direct_write_reschedule_io()\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Use the correct commit info in nfs_join_page_group()\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: More O_DIRECT accounting fixes for error paths\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix O_DIRECT locking issues (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix error handling for O_DIRECT write scheduling\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix a potential data corruption (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix a use after free in nfs_direct_join_group()\n  (bsc#1211162).\n- nfs: only issue commit in DIO codepath if we have uncommitted\n  data (bsc#1211162).\n- NFS: Fix a few more clear_bit() instances that need release\n  semantics (bsc#1211162).\n- commit e61bcf9\n\n- md: Put the right device in md_seq_next (bsc#1217822).\n- commit 99a688a\n\n- xfs: make sure maxlen is still congruent with prod when rounding\n  down (git-fixes).\n- commit 2b9fc44\n\n- xfs: fix units conversion error in xfs_bmap_del_extent_delay\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 95e2620\n\n- xfs: fix agf_fllast when repairing an empty AGFL (git-fixes).\n- commit bfb62b0\n\n- xfs: return EINTR when a fatal signal terminates scrub\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit e6f4fe7\n\n- xfs: fix a bug in the online fsck directory leaf1 bestcount\n  check (git-fixes).\n- commit e328537\n\n- xfs: fix incorrect unit conversion in scrub tracepoint\n  (git-fixes).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/xfs-standardize-AG-block-number-formatting-in-ftrace-output.patch.\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/xfs-standardize-AG-number-formatting-in-ftrace-output.patch.\n- commit e256630\n\n- xfs: decode scrub flags in ftrace output (git-fixes).\n- commit d1fe7f7\n\n- xfs: remove the xfs_dsb_t typedef (git-fixes).\n- commit 4e9f379\n\n- xfs: fix uninit warning in xfs_growfs_data (git-fixes).\n- commit e9c4821\n\n- xfs: convert flex-array declarations in struct xfs_attrlist*\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit e33e297\n\n- xfs: remove the xfs_dinode_t typedef (git-fixes).\n- commit c807e19\n\n- xfs: convert flex-array declarations in xfs attr shortform\n  objects (git-fixes).\n- commit 757cbc7\n\n- xfs: convert flex-array declarations in xfs attr leaf blocks\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 1823624\n\n- xfs: use swap() to make dabtree code cleaner (git-fixes).\n- commit d160cc2\n\n- xfs: fix silly whitespace problems with kernel libxfs\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit d822e52\n\n- xfs: rename xfs_has_attr() (git-fixes).\n- commit fe8702c\n\n- xfs: Rename __xfs_attr_rmtval_remove (git-fixes).\n- commit 6ea2cef\n\n- xfs: sysfs: use default_groups in kobj_type (git-fixes).\n- commit 74d9b5c\n\n- xfs: replace snprintf in show functions with sysfs_emit\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 84db35d\n\n- xfs: simplify two-level sysctl registration for xfs_table\n  (git-fixes).\n- commit 0321d28\n\n- xfs: add selinux labels to whiteout inodes (git-fixes).\n- commit 8dc479c\n\n- xfs: Use kvcalloc() instead of kvzalloc() (git-fixes).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/xfs-reject-crazy-array-sizes-being-fed-to-XFS_IOC_GE.patch.\n- commit 89900e3\n\n- xfs: clean up \u0026quot;%Ld/%Lu\u0026quot;

availability at runtime\n  (bsc#1218831)\n- Make Wakeup class EINTR safe.\n- Add a way to cancel media operations on shutdown\n  (openSUSE/zypper#522)\n  This patch adds a mechanism to signal libzypp that a shutdown was\n  requested, usually when CTRL+C was pressed by the user. Currently\n  only the media backend will utilize this, but can be extended to\n  all code paths that use g_poll() to wait for events.\n- Manually poll fds for curl in MediaCurl.\n  Using curl_easy_perform does not give us the required control on\n  when we want to cancel a download. Switching to the MultiCurl\n  implementation with a external poll() event loop will give us\n  much more freedom and helps us to improve our Ctrl+C handling.\n- Move reusable curl poll code to curlhelper.h.\n- version 17.31.29 (22)\n\n- Fix to build with libxml 2.12.x (fixes #505)\n- version 17.31.28 (22)\n\n- CheckAccessDeleted: fix 'running in container' filter\n  (bsc#1218291)\n- version 17.31.27 (22)\n\n- Call zypp commit plugins during transactional update (fixes #506)\n- Add support for loongarch64 (fixes #504)\n- Teach MediaMultiCurl to download HTTP Multibyte ranges.\n- Teach zsync downloads to MultiCurl.\n- Expand RepoVars in URLs downloading a .repo file (bsc#1212160)\n  Convenient and helps documentation as it may refer to a single\n  command for a bunch of distributions.

Avoid this\n  colorific collision between download progress bar and scriptlet\n  output.\n- Fix ProgressBar's calculation of the printed tag position (fixes #494)\n- Switch zypp::Digest to Openssl 3.0 Provider API (fixes #144)\n- Fix usage of deprecated CURL features (fixes #486)\n- version 17.31.24 (22)\n\n- Stop using boost version 1 timer library (fixes #489,\n  bsc#1215294)\n- version 17.31.23 (22)\n\nPackage netcfg was updated:\n\nPackage openssh was updated:\n\n- Added openssh-cve-2023-51385.patch (bsc#1218215, CVE-2023-51385).

This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage wicked was updated:\n\n- update to version 0.6.74  + team: add new options like link_watch_policy (jsc#PED-7183)\n  + Fix memory leaks in dbus variant destroy and fsm free (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1001)\n  + xpath: allow underscore in node identifier (gh#openSUSE/wicked#999)\n  + vxlan: don't format unknown rtnl attrs (bsc#1219751)\n- removed patches included in the source archive:\n  [- 0009-ifreload-VLAN-changes-require-device-deletion-bsc-12.patch]\n  [- 0008-ifcheck-fix-config-changed-check-bsc-1218926.patch]\n  [- 0007-Fix-ifstatus-exit-code-for-NI_WICKED_ST_NO_CARRIER-s.patch]\n  [- 0006-dhcp6-omit-the-SO_REUSEPORT-option-bsc-1215692.patch]\n  [- 0005-duid-fix-comment-for-v6time.patch]\n  [- 0004-rtnl-parse-peer-address-on-non-ptp-interfaces.patch]\n  [- 0003-rtnl-pass-ifname-in-newaddr-parsing-and-logging.patch]\n  [- 0002-system-updater-Parse-updater-format-from-XML-configu.patch]\n  [- 0001-fix_arp_notify_loop_and_burst_sending.patch]\n\n- ifreload: VLAN changes require device deletion (bsc#1218927)\n  [+ 0009-ifreload-VLAN-changes-require-device-deletion-bsc-12.patch]\n- ifcheck: fix config changed check (bsc#1218926)\n  [+ 0008-ifcheck-fix-config-changed-check-bsc-1218926.patch]\n- client: fix exit code for no-carrier status (bsc#1219265)\n  [+ 0007-Fix-ifstatus-exit-code-for-NI_WICKED_ST_NO_CARRIER-s.patch]\n- dhcp6: omit the SO_REUSEPORT option (bsc#1215692)\n  [+ 0006-dhcp6-omit-the-SO_REUSEPORT-option-bsc-1215692.patch]\n- duid: fix comment for v6time\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/989)\n  [+ 0005-duid-fix-comment-for-v6time.patch]\n- rtnl: fix peer address parsing for non ptp-interfaces\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/987,\n  https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/988)\n  [+ 0003-rtnl-pass-ifname-in-newaddr-parsing-and-logging.patch]\n  [+ 0004-rtnl-parse-peer-address-on-non-ptp-interfaces.patch]\n- system-updater: Parse updater format from XML configuration to\n  ensure install calls can run.\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/985)\n  [+ 0002-system-updater-Parse-updater-format-from-XML-configu.patch]\n\nPackage xen was updated:\n\n- bsc#1219885 -

The deferment is\naccomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when\nreleasing the last ref-counter of bpf map.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots\n\nPrivileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack\nmemory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses\nwere permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state-\u003eallocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\n\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\n\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\n\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect\n\nhidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)\nraces when it races with itself.\n\nhidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs\non probe() and if a \"device-connected\" packet is received by the hw\nwhen the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on\nthe hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be\nstarted from the workqueue.\n\nThis opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):\n\n1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---",

      "Description": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.",

The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b",

But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +\nfx_sw-\u003exstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and\ntries xrstor again.
