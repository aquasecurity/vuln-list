be1bdab\n\n- compute-PATCHVERSION: Do not produce output when awk fails\n  compute-PATCHVERSION uses awk to produce a shell script that is\n  subsequently executed to update shell variables which are then printed\n  as the patchversion.\n  Some versions of awk, most notably bysybox-gawk do not understand the\n  awk program and fail to run. This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead. That prevents printing the stale values, generates no\n  output, and generates invalid rpm spec file down the line. Then the\n  problem is flagged early and should be easier to diagnose.\n- commit 8ef8383\n\n- x86/cpu, kvm: Move X86_FEATURE_LFENCE_RDTSC to its native leaf (git-fixes).\n- commit 6d2e676\n\n- KVM: x86: Move open-coded CPUID leaf 0x80000021 EAX bit propagation  code (git-fixes).\n- commit 1f3dbeb\n\n- KVM: x86: synthesize CPUID leaf 0x80000021h if useful (git-fixes).\n- commit 2581a0e\n\n- KVM: x86: add support for CPUID leaf 0x80000021 (git-fixes).\n- commit 79ab1f6\n\n- x86/asm: Add _ASM_RIP() macro for x86-64 (%rip) suffix (git-fixes).\n- commit 26d80bf\n\n- KVM: VMX: Move VERW closer to VMentry for MDS mitigation (git-fixes).\n- KVM: VMX: Use BT+JNC, i.e. EFLAGS.CF to select VMRESUME vs. VMLAUNCH (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Use ALTERNATIVE() instead of mds_user_clear static key (git-fixes).\n  Also add the removed mds_user_clear symbol to kABI severities as it is\n  exposed just for KVM module and is generally a core kernel component so\n  removing it is low risk.\n- x86/entry_32: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Add asm helpers for executing VERW (git-fixes).\n- commit 8f33ff8\n\n- mbcache: Fixup kABI of mb_cache_entry (bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915).\n- commit 52b181f\n\n- ext4: fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption\n  (bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915).\n- commit 14e0a9c\n\n- net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv\n  (bsc#1219127 CVE-2024-23849).\n- commit 75b4a5b\n\n- Update to add CVE-2024-23851 tag,\n  patches.suse/dm-limit-the-number-of-targets-and-parameter-size-ar.patch\n  (bsc#1219827, bsc#1219146, CVE-2023-52429, CVE-2024-23851).\n- commit ef15d5e\n\n- dm: limit the number of targets and parameter size area\n  (bsc#1219827, bsc#1219146, CVE-2023-52429).\n- commit 2431307\n\n- vhost: use kzalloc() instead of kmalloc() followed by memset()\n  (CVE-2024-0340, bsc#1218689).\n- commit aa86ef0\n\n- rpm/kernel-binary.spec.in: install scripts/gdb when enabled in config\n  (bsc#1219653)\n  They are put into -devel subpackage.

It was introduced in 2010 but haven't received\n  any updates on any branch since 2015. The file is renamed by tar-up.sh\n  to config-options.changes.txt and shipped in the kernel-source RPM\n  package under /usr/share/doc. As its content now only contains outdated\n  information, retaining it can lead to confusion for users encountering\n  this file.\n  Config changes are nowadays described in associated Git commit messages,\n  which get automatically collected and are incorporated into changelogs\n  of kernel RPM packages.\n  Drop then this obsolete file, starting with its packaging logic.\n  For branch maintainers: Upon merging this commit on your branch, please\n  correspondingly delete the file doc/config-options.changes.\n- commit adedbd2\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Simplify the list of references (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Reduce indentation in the list of references, make the style consistent\n  with README.md.\n- commit 70e3c33\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Add how to update the config for module signing\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Configuration files for SUSE kernels include settings to integrate with\n  signing support provided by the Open Build Service. This creates\n  problems if someone tries to use such a configuration file to build\n  a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; kernel as described in doc/README.SUSE:\n  * Default configuration files available in the kernel-source repository\n  unset CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL to leave module signing to\n  pesign-obs-integration. In case of a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; build, this\n  integration is not available and the modules don't get signed.\n  * The kernel spec file overrides CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to\n  \u0026quot;.kernel_signing_key.pem\u0026quot; which is a file populated by certificates\n  provided by OBS but otherwise not available. The value ends up in\n  /boot/config-$VERSION-$RELEASE-$FLAVOR and /proc/config.gz. If someone\n  decides to use one of these files as their base configuration then the\n  build fails with an error because the specified module signing key is\n  missing.\n  Add information on how to enable module signing and where to find the\n  relevant upstream documentation.\n- commit a699dc3\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Remove how to build modules using kernel-source\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Remove the first method how to build kernel modules from the readme. It\n  describes a process consisting of the kernel-source installation,\n  configuring this kernel and then performing an ad-hoc module build.\n  This method is not ideal as no modversion data is involved in the\n  process. It results in a module with no symbol CRCs which can be wrongly\n  loaded on an incompatible kernel.\n  Removing the method also simplifies the readme because only two main\n  methods how to build the modules are then described, either doing an\n  ad-hoc build using kernel-devel, or creating a proper Kernel Module\n  Package.\n- commit 9285bb8\n\nPackage util-linux was updated:\n\n- Add upstream patch  util-linux-libuuid-avoid-truncate-clocks.txt-to-improve-perform.patch\n  bsc#1207987 gh#util-linux/util-linux@1d98827edde4\n\nPackage libxcrypt was updated:\n\n- fix variable name for datamember in 'struct crypt_data' [bsc#1215496]- added patches\n  fix https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/commit/b212d601549a0fc84cbbcaf21b931f903787d7e2\n  + libxcrypt-man-fix-variable-name.patch\n\nPackage gnutls was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1218865, CVE-2024-0553]  * Incomplete fix for CVE-2023-5981.\n  * The response times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK\n    ClientKeyExchange differ from response times of ciphertexts\n    with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.\n  * Add gnutls-CVE-2024-0553.patch\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1217277, CVE-2023-5981]\n  * Fix timing side-channel inside RSA-PSK key exchange.\n  * auth/rsa_psk: side-step potential side-channel\n  * Add curl-CVE-2023-5981.patch\n\nPackage ncurses was updated:\n\n- Add patch bsc1218014-cve-2023-50495.patch  * Fix CVE-2023-50495: segmentation fault via _nc_wrap_entry()\n\n- Add patch boo1201384.patch\n  * Do not fully reset serial lines\n\nPackage openssl-1_1 was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1219243, CVE-2024-0727]  * Add NULL checks where ContentInfo data can be NULL\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2024-0727.patch\n\nPackage polkit was updated:\n\nPackage procps was updated:\n\n- Submit latest procps 3.3.17 to SLE-15 tree for jira#PED-3244  and jira#PED-6369\n- The patches now upstream had been dropped meanwhile\n  * procps-vmstat-1b9ea611.patch (bsc#1185417)\n  - For support up to 2048 CPU as well\n  * bsc1209122-a6c0795d.patch (bnc#1209122)\n  - allow `-Â´ as leading character to ignore possible errors\n    on systctl entries\n  * patch procps-ng-3.3.9-bsc1121753-Cpus.patch (bsc#1121753)\n  - was a backport of an upstream fix to get the first CPU\n    summary correct\n- Enable pidof for SLE-15 as this is provided by sysvinit-tools\n- Use a check on syscall __NR_pidfd_open to decide if\n  the pwait tool and its manual page will be build\n\n- Modify patches\n  * procps-ng-3.3.9-w-notruncate.diff\n  * procps-ng-3.3.17-logind.patch\n  to real to not truncate output of w with option -n\n\n- procps-ng-3.3.17-logind.patch: Backport from 4.x git, prefer\n  logind over utmp (jsc#PED-3144)\n\nPackage python3 was updated:\n\n- (bsc#1219666, CVE-2023-6597) Add  CVE-2023-6597-TempDir-cleaning-symlink.patch (patch from\n  gh#python/cpython!99930) fixing symlink bug in cleanup of\n  tempfile.TemporaryDirectory.\n- Merge together bpo-36576-skip_tests_for_OpenSSL-111.patch into\n  skip_SSL_tests.patch, and make them include all conditionals.\n\n- Refresh CVE-2023-27043-email-parsing-errors.patch to\n  gh#python/cpython!111116, fixing bsc#1210638 (CVE-2023-27043).\n\nPackage qrencode was updated:\n\n- update to 4.1.1 (jsc#PED-7296):  * Some minor bugs in Micro QR Code generation have been fixed.\n  * The data capacity calculations are now correct.

This affects Asia/Almaty and\n    Asia/Qostanay which together represent the eastern portion of the\n    country that will transition from UTC+6 on 2024-03-01 at 00:00 to\n    join the western portion.  (Thanks to Zhanbolat Raimbekov.)\n  * Palestine springs forward a week later than previously predicted\n    in 2024 and 2025.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Change spring-forward\n    predictions to the second Saturday after Ramadan, not the first;\n    this also affects other predictions starting in 2039.\n  * Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh's 1955-07-01 transition occurred at 01:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to ÄoÃ n Tráº§n CÃ´ng Danh.)\n  * From 1947 through 1949, Toronto's transitions occurred at 02:00\n    not 00:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\nPackage vim was updated:\n\n- Updated to version 9.1 with patch level 0111, fixes the following security problems  * Fixing bsc#1217316 (CVE-2023-48231) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48231: vim: Use-After-Free in win_close()\n  * Fixing bsc#1217320 (CVE-2023-48232) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48232: vim: Floating point Exception in adjust_plines_for_skipcol()\n  * Fixing bsc#1217321 (CVE-2023-48233) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48233: vim: overflow with count for :s command\n  * Fixing bsc#1217324 (CVE-2023-48234) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48234: vim: overflow in nv_z_get_count\n  * Fixing bsc#1217326 (CVE-2023-48235) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48235: vim: overflow in ex address parsing\n  * Fixing bsc#1217329 (CVE-2023-48236) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48236: vim: overflow in get_number\n  * Fixing bsc#1217330 (CVE-2023-48237) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48237: vim: overflow in shift_line\n  * Fixing bsc#1217432 (CVE-2023-48706) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-48706: vim: heap-use-after-free in ex_substitute\n  * Fixing bsc#1219581 (CVE-2024-22667) - VUL-0: CVE-2024-22667: vim: stack-based buffer overflow in did_set_langmap function in map.c\n  * Fixing bsc#1215005 (CVE-2023-4750) - VUL-0: CVE-2023-4750: vim: Heap use-after-free in function bt_quickfix\n- for the complete list of changes see\n  https://github.com/vim/vim/compare/v9.0.2103...v9.1.0111\n\nPackage wicked was updated:\n\n- update to version 0.6.74  + team: add new options like link_watch_policy (jsc#PED-7183)\n  + Fix memory leaks in dbus variant destroy and fsm free (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1001)\n  + xpath: allow underscore in node identifier (gh#openSUSE/wicked#999)\n  + vxlan: don't format unknown rtnl attrs (bsc#1219751)\n- removed patches included in the source archive:\n  [- 0009-ifreload-VLAN-changes-require-device-deletion-bsc-12.patch]\n  [- 0008-ifcheck-fix-config-changed-check-bsc-1218926.patch]\n  [- 0007-Fix-ifstatus-exit-code-for-NI_WICKED_ST_NO_CARRIER-s.patch]\n  [- 0006-dhcp6-omit-the-SO_REUSEPORT-option-bsc-1215692.patch]\n  [- 0005-duid-fix-comment-for-v6time.patch]\n  [- 0004-rtnl-parse-peer-address-on-non-ptp-interfaces.patch]\n  [- 0003-rtnl-pass-ifname-in-newaddr-parsing-and-logging.patch]\n  [- 0002-system-updater-Parse-updater-format-from-XML-configu.patch]\n  [- 0001-fix_arp_notify_loop_and_burst_sending.patch]\n\n- ifreload: VLAN changes require device deletion (bsc#1218927)\n  [+ 0009-ifreload-VLAN-changes-require-device-deletion-bsc-12.patch]\n- ifcheck: fix config changed check (bsc#1218926)\n  [+ 0008-ifcheck-fix-config-changed-check-bsc-1218926.patch]\n- client: fix exit code for no-carrier status (bsc#1219265)\n  [+ 0007-Fix-ifstatus-exit-code-for-NI_WICKED_ST_NO_CARRIER-s.patch]\n- dhcp6: omit the SO_REUSEPORT option (bsc#1215692)\n  [+ 0006-dhcp6-omit-the-SO_REUSEPORT-option-bsc-1215692.patch]\n- duid: fix comment for v6time\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/989)\n  [+ 0005-duid-fix-comment-for-v6time.patch]\n- rtnl: fix peer address parsing for non ptp-interfaces\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/987,\n  https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/988)\n  [+ 0003-rtnl-pass-ifname-in-newaddr-parsing-and-logging.patch]\n  [+ 0004-rtnl-parse-peer-address-on-non-ptp-interfaces.patch]\n- system-updater: Parse updater format from XML configuration to\n  ensure install calls can run.\n  (https://github.com/openSUSE/wicked/pull/985)\n  [+ 0002-system-updater-Parse-updater-format-from-XML-configu.patch]\n\nPackage xen was updated:\n\n- bsc#1218851 - VUL-0: CVE-2023-46839: xen: phantom functions  assigned to incorrect contexts (XSA-449)\n  xsa449.patch\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n- Fix search/info commands ignoring --ignore-unknown (bsc#1217593)  The switch makes search commands return 0 rather than 104 for\n  empty search results.\n- version 1.14.68\n\n- patch: Make sure reboot-needed is remembered until next boot\n  (bsc#1217873)\n- version 1.14.67\n\n",

Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id has.

In case the\nfirst extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from\nextents overflow file.\n\nIn case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which\nlocates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was\nchanged so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.\n\nRight action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size\ninside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if\nthe whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard\n(blk_cnt \u003e start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has\nunfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed\nunconditionally.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and\nthen perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so\nthat the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This\ncauses the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of\ntruncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.\n\nFix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the\nstart of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent\nrecord.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous\nplace since we're dropping -\u003etree_lock and it can cause a race condition\nand the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.\n\nAnother issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block\n(blk_cnt \u003e start) we are not holding the -\u003etree_lock.  We break out from\nthe loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not\nsure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,\nbut it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if\nthere's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in\nbalance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check.",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2.

During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b",
