And this leads to\nthe updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to\nfbcon_display-\u003evrows, which makes the real_y() return a\nwrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes\nthe imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.\n\nTo solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called\neven if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will\n\"fix and fill\" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.",
