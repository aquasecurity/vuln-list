      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp5-chost-byos-v20241112-arm64 contains the following changes:\nPackage curl was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1232528, CVE-2024-9681]  * HSTS subdomain overwrites parent cache entry\n  * Add curl-CVE-2024-9681.patch\n\nPackage lvm2 was updated:\n\n- LVM2 mirror attached to another node couldn't be converted into linear LV (bsc#1231796)  + bug-1231796_lvconvert-fix-lvconvert-m-0-for-in-sync-legs.patch\n\nPackage openssl-1_1 was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1220262, CVE-2023-50782]  * Implicit rejection in PKCS#1 v1.5\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-50782.patch\n\nPackage python3 was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2024-9287-venv_path_unquoted.patch to properly quote  path names provided when creating a virtual environment\n  (bsc#1232241, CVE-2024-9287)\n\n- Drop .pyc files from docdir for reproducible builds\n  (bsc#1230906).\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- PluginFrame: Send unescaped colons in header values  (bsc#1231043)\n  According to the STOMP protocol it would be correct to escape a\n  colon in a header-value, but it breaks plugin receivers which do\n  not expect this. The first colon separates header-name from\n  header-value, so escaping in the header-value is not needed\n  anyway.\n  Escaping in the header-value affects especially the urlresolver\n  plugins. The input URL is passed in a header, but sent back as\n  raw data in the frames body. If the plugin receiver does not\n  correctly unescape the URL we may get back a \u0026quot;https\\c//\u0026quot; which is\n  not usable.\n- Do not ignore return value of std::remove_if in MediaSyncFacade\n  (fixes #579)\n- Fix hang in curl code with no network connection (bsc#1230912)\n- version 17.35.12 (35)\n\nPackage shadow was updated:\n\n- bsc#1230972: Add useradd warnings when requested UID is outside  the default range\n- add shadow-bsc1230972-useradd-warning.patch\n\n- bsc#1228337: chage -d date vs passwd -S output is off by one\n  Remove shadow-bsc1176006-chage-date.patch\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-basesystem-release was updated:\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-containers-release was updated:\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-public-cloud-release was updated:\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-server-applications-release was updated:\n\nPackage wget was updated:\n\n- Update 0001-possibly-truncate-pathname-components.patch  * Take the patch from savannah repository where the checking of the file\n    length doesn't include path length.\n  * [bsc#1204720, bsc#1231661]\n\nPackage wicked was updated:\n\n- Update to version 0.6.77  - compat-suse: use iftype in sysctl handling (bsc#1230911, gh#openSUSE/wicked#1043)\n  - Always generate the ipv4/ipv6 \u0026lt;enabled\u0026gt;true|false\u0026lt;/enabled\u0026gt; node\n  - Inherit all, default and interface sysctl settings also for loopback,\n    except for use_tempaddr and accept_dad.\n  - Consider only interface specific accept_redirects sysctl settings.\n  - Adopt ifsysctl(5) manual page with wicked specific behavior.\n  - route: fix family and destination processing (bsc#1231060)\n  - man: improve wicked-config(5) file description (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1039)\n  - dhcp4: add ignore-rfc3927-1-6 wicked-config(5) option (jsc#PED-10855, gh#openSUSE/wicked#1038)\n  - team: set arp link watcher interval default to 1s (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1037)\n  - systemd: use `BindsTo=dbus.service` in favor of `Requisite=` (bsc#1229745)\n  - compat-suse: fix use of deprecated `INTERFACETYPE=dummy` (boo#1229555)\n  - arp: don't set target broadcast hardware address (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1036)\n  - dbus: don't memcpy empty/NULL array value (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1035)\n  - ethtool: fix leak and free pause data in ethtool_free (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1030)\n- Removed patches included in the source archive:\n  [- 0001-compat-suse-repair-dummy-interfaces-boo-1229555.patch]\n\n",

      "Description": "When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might\noverwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than\notherwise intended.\n\nThis affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the\ninsecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like\n`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain\nof the second host.\n\n(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to\nhave been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for\nthe domains involved to trigger this problem.)\n\nWhen `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this\nbug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the\nparent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.\n\nThe result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get\nconverted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by\nthe origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its\nexpiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the\n(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry\n*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier\nthan otherwise intended.",
