The first colon separates header-name from\n  header-value, so escaping in the header-value is not needed\n  anyway.\n  Escaping in the header-value affects especially the urlresolver\n  plugins. The input URL is passed in a header, but sent back as\n  raw data in the frames body. If the plugin receiver does not\n  correctly unescape the URL we may get back a \u0026quot;https\\c//\u0026quot; which is\n  not usable.\n- Do not ignore return value of std::remove_if in MediaSyncFacade\n  (fixes #579)\n- Fix hang in curl code with no network connection (bsc#1230912)\n- version 17.35.12 (35)\n\nPackage shadow was updated:\n\n- bsc#1230972: Add useradd warnings when requested UID is outside  the default range\n- add shadow-bsc1230972-useradd-warning.patch\n\n- bsc#1228337: chage -d date vs passwd -S output is off by one\n  Remove shadow-bsc1176006-chage-date.patch\n\nPackage shim was updated:\n\n- Update shim-install to apply the missing fix for openSUSE Leap  (bsc#1210382) fixed by Gary.\n  * 86b73d1 Fix that bootx64.efi is not updated on Leap\n- Update shim-install to use the 'removable' way for SL-Micro\n  (bsc#1230316) fixed by Gary.\n  * 433cc4e Always use the removable way for SL-Micro\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-basesystem-release was updated:\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-containers-release was updated:\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-public-cloud-release was updated:\n\nPackage 000release-packages:sle-module-server-applications-release was updated:\n\nPackage wget was updated:\n\n- Update 0001-possibly-truncate-pathname-components.patch  * Take the patch from savannah repository where the checking of the file\n    length doesn't include path length.\n  * [bsc#1204720, bsc#1231661]\n\nPackage wicked was updated:\n\n- Update to version 0.6.77  - compat-suse: use iftype in sysctl handling (bsc#1230911, gh#openSUSE/wicked#1043)\n  - Always generate the ipv4/ipv6 \u0026lt;enabled\u0026gt;true|false\u0026lt;/enabled\u0026gt; node\n  - Inherit all, default and interface sysctl settings also for loopback,\n    except for use_tempaddr and accept_dad.\n  - Consider only interface specific accept_redirects sysctl settings.\n  - Adopt ifsysctl(5) manual page with wicked specific behavior.\n  - route: fix family and destination processing (bsc#1231060)\n  - man: improve wicked-config(5) file description (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1039)\n  - dhcp4: add ignore-rfc3927-1-6 wicked-config(5) option (jsc#PED-10855, gh#openSUSE/wicked#1038)\n  - team: set arp link watcher interval default to 1s (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1037)\n  - systemd: use `BindsTo=dbus.service` in favor of `Requisite=` (bsc#1229745)\n  - compat-suse: fix use of deprecated `INTERFACETYPE=dummy` (boo#1229555)\n  - arp: don't set target broadcast hardware address (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1036)\n  - dbus: don't memcpy empty/NULL array value (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1035)\n  - ethtool: fix leak and free pause data in ethtool_free (gh#openSUSE/wicked#1030)\n- Removed patches included in the source archive:\n  [- 0001-compat-suse-repair-dummy-interfaces-boo-1229555.patch]\n\nPackage xen was updated:\n\n- bsc#1232622 - VUL-0: CVE-2024-45818: xen: Deadlock in x86 HVM  standard VGA handling (XSA-463)\n  xsa463-01.patch\n  xsa463-02.patch\n  xsa463-03.patch\n  xsa463-04.patch\n  xsa463-05.patch\n  xsa463-06.patch\n  xsa463-07.patch\n  xsa463-08.patch\n  xsa463-09.patch\n  xsa463-10.patch\n- bsc#1232624 - VUL-0: CVE-2024-45819: xen: libxl leaks data to PVH\n  guests via ACPI tables (XSA-464)\n  xsa464.patch\n- Drop the following patches\n  66e29480-x86-HVM-properly-reject-indirect-VRAM-writes.patch\n  stdvga-cache.patch\n\n- bsc#1232542 - remove usage of net-tools-deprecated from supportconfig plugin\n\n- bsc#1230366 - VUL-0: CVE-2024-45817: xen: x86: Deadlock in\n  vlapic_error() (XSA-462)\n  66f2af41-x86-vLAPIC-undue-recursion-of-vlapic_error.patch\n  Drop xsa462.patch\n- Upstream bug fixes (bsc#1027519)\n  66cf737b-x86-Dom0-disable-SMAP-for-PV-only.patch\n  66d6dca8-libxl-nul-termination-in-xen_console_read_line.patch\n  66d8690f-SUPPORT-split-XSM-from-Flask.patch\n  66e29480-x86-HVM-properly-reject-indirect-VRAM-writes.patch\n  66e44ae2-x86-ucode-AMD-buffer-underrun.patch\n  66f2fd92-x86-ucode-Intel-stricter-sanity-check.patch\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n",

Locking involved\nthere has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the\nreturn from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a\nproblem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of\nwhich touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't\nrelevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already\nbeing held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a\ndeadlock.\n\nThis deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but\nwas analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light\nof the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking\ndiscipline work.\n\nIn staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered\nto be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the\nlocking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note\nthat even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired\nfor any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.",

If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its\nexpiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the\n(wrongly set) timeout expires.
