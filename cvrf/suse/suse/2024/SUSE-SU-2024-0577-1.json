      "Text": "This update for python-aiohttp, python-time-machine fixes the following issues:\n\npython-aiohttp was updated to version 3.9.3:\n\n* Fixed backwards compatibility breakage (in 3.9.2) of ``ssl`` parameter\n  when set outside of ``ClientSession`` (e.g. directly in ``TCPConnector``)\n* Improved test suite handling of paths and temp files to consistently\n  use pathlib and pytest fixtures.\n\nFrom version 3.9.2 (bsc#1219341, CVE-2024-23334, bsc#1219342, CVE-2024-23829):\n\n* Fixed server-side websocket connection leak.\n* Fixed ``web.FileResponse`` doing blocking I/O in the event loop.\n* Fixed double compress when compression enabled and compressed file\n  exists in server file responses.\n* Added runtime type check for ``ClientSession`` ``timeout`` parameter.\n* Fixed an unhandled exception in the Python HTTP parser on header lines\n  starting with a colon.\n* Improved validation of paths for static resources requests to the server.\n* Added support for passing :py:data:`True` to ``ssl`` parameter in\n  ``ClientSession`` while deprecating :py:data:`None`.\n* Fixed an unhandled exception in the Python HTTP parser on header lines\n  starting with a colon.\n* Fixed examples of ``fallback_charset_resolver`` function in the\n  :doc:`client_advanced` document.\n* The Sphinx setup was updated to avoid showing the empty\n  changelog draft section in the tagged release documentation\n  builds on Read The Docs.\n* The changelog categorization was made clearer. The contributors can\n  now mark their fragment files more accurately.\n* Updated :ref:`contributing/Tests coverage \u003caiohttp-contributing\u003e`\n  section to show how we use ``codecov``.\n* Replaced all ``tmpdir`` fixtures with ``tmp_path`` in test suite.\n\n- Disable broken tests with openssl 3.2 and python \u003c 3.11 bsc#1217782\n\nupdate to 3.9.1:\n\n* Fixed importing aiohttp under PyPy on Windows.\n* Fixed async concurrency safety in websocket compressor.\n* Fixed ``ClientResponse.close()`` releasing the connection\n  instead of closing.\n* Fixed a regression where connection may get closed during\n  upgrade. -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`\n* Fixed messages being reported as upgraded without an Upgrade\n  header in Python parser. -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`\n\nupdate to

pending tasks\n  to complete before the application's cleanup is called.\n* Added `handler_cancellation`_ parameter to cancel web handler on\n  client disconnection.\n* This (optionally) reintroduces a feature removed in a\n  previous release.\n* Recommended for those looking for an extra level of\n  protection against denial-of-service attacks.\n* Added support for setting response header parameters\n  ``max_line_size`` and ``max_field_size``.\n* Added ``auto_decompress`` parameter to\n  ``ClientSession.request`` to override\n  ``ClientSession._auto_decompress``.\n* Changed ``raise_for_status`` to allow a coroutine.\n* Added client brotli compression support (optional with\n  runtime check).\n* Added ``client_max_size`` to ``BaseRequest.clone()`` to allow\n  overriding the request body size. -- :user:`anesabml`.\n* Added a middleware type alias\n  ``aiohttp.typedefs.Middleware``.\n* Exported ``HTTPMove`` which can be used to catch any\n  redirection request that has a location -- :user:`dreamsorcerer`.\n* Changed the ``path`` parameter in ``web.run_app()`` to accept\n  a ``pathlib.Path`` object.\n* Performance: Skipped filtering ``CookieJar`` when the jar is\n  empty or all cookies have expired.\n* Performance: Only check origin if insecure scheme and there\n  are origins to treat as secure, in\n  ``CookieJar.filter_cookies()``.\n* Performance: Used timestamp instead of ``datetime`` to\n  achieve faster cookie expiration in ``CookieJar``.\n* Added support for passing a custom server name parameter to\n  HTTPS connection.\n* Added support for using Basic Auth credentials from\n  :file:`.netrc` file when making HTTP requests with the\n* :py:class:`~aiohttp.ClientSession` ``trust_env`` argument is\n  set to ``True``. -- by :user:`yuvipanda`.\n* Turned access log into no-op when the logger is disabled.\n* Added typing information to ``RawResponseMessage``. -- by\n  :user:`Gobot1234`\n* Removed ``async-timeout`` for Python 3.11+ (replaced with\n  ``asyncio.timeout()`` on newer releases).\n* Added support for ``brotlicffi`` as an alternative to\n  ``brotli`` (fixing Brotli support on PyPy).\n* Added ``WebSocketResponse.get_extra_info()`` to access a\n  protocol transport's extra info.\n* Allow ``link`` argument to be set to None/empty in HTTP 451\n  exception.\n* Fixed client timeout not working when incoming data is always\n  available without waiting. -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.\n* Fixed ``readuntil`` to work with a delimiter of more than one\n  character.\n* Added ``__repr__`` to

      "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol, if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and log the request. This vulnerability has been addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
