bunch of feature coverage for native\n  histograms and breaking changes.\n  If you are trying native histograms already, we recommend you\n  remove the `wal` directory when upgrading.\n  Because the old WAL record for native histograms is not\n  backward compatible in v2.42.0, this will lead to some data\n  loss for the latest data.\n  Additionally, if you scrape 'float histograms' or use recording\n  rules on native histograms in v2.42.0 (which writes float\n  histograms), it is a one-way street since older versions do not\n  support float histograms.\n  * [CHANGE] **breaking** TSDB: Changed WAL record format for the\n    experimental native histograms.\n  * [FEATURE] Add 'keep_firing_for' field to alerting rules.\n  * [FEATURE] Promtool: Add support of selecting timeseries for\n

page.\n- update to 2.41.0:\n  * [FEATURE] Relabeling: Add keepequal and dropequal relabel\n    actions.\n  * [FEATURE] Add support for HTTP proxy headers. \n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Reload private certificates when changed on disk.\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Add max_version to specify maximum TLS version in\n    tls_config.\n  * [ENHANCEMENT] Add goos and goarch labels to\n    prometheus_build_info.\n

The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected.

A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",
