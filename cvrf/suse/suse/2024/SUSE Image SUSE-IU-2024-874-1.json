modules no longer taint the kernel, update the respective documentation\n  in README.SUSE:\n  * Describe that support status can be obtained at runtime for each\n  module from /sys/module/$MODULE/supported and for the entire system\n  from /sys/kernel/supported. This provides a way how to now check that\n  the kernel has any externally supported modules loaded.\n  * Remove a mention that externally supported modules taint the kernel,\n  but keep the information about bit 16 (X) and add a note that it is\n  still tracked per module and can be read from\n  /sys/module/$MODULE/taint. This per-module information also appears in\n  Oopses.\n- commit 9ed8107\n\n- powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array\n  (bsc#1220250,CVE-2023-52451).\n- commit 9865154\n\n- Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration\n  (CVE-2021-46932 bsc#1220444).\n- commit 8f106a8\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/ipc-mqueue-msg-sem-Avoid-relying-on-a-stack-reference.patch\n  (bsc#1185988, bsc1220826, CVE-2021-47069).\n- commit f01183e\n\n- Update References\n  patches.suse/ACPI-GTDT-Don-t-corrupt-interrupt-mappings-on-watchd.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1220599 CVE-2021-46953).\n- commit 5b10499\n\n- Update References\n  patches.suse/ACPI-custom_method-fix-potential-use-after-free-issu.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1220572 CVE-2021-46966).\n- commit 8eecec3\n\n- efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not\n  supported (bsc#1220328 CVE-2023-52463).\n- commit 0c76724\n\n- RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr (bsc#1220627\n  CVE-2021-47012).\n- commit 96f4478\n\n- mtd: Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifier\n  (bsc#1220238 CVE-2023-52449).\n- commit d23e49b\n\n- Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in\n  powermate_config_complete (CVE-2023-52475 bsc#1220649).\n- HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect\n  (CVE-2023-52478 bsc#1220796).\n- commit 92ea315\n\n- hfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate (bsc#1220737\n  CVE-2021-46989).\n- commit cc37c78\n\n- Update patch reference for qcom bus fix (CVE-2021-47054 bsc#1220767)\n- commit 024411a\n\n- netfilter: nft_limit: avoid possible divide error in\n  nft_limit_init (bsc#1220436 CVE-2021-46915).\n- commit 291b0ff\n\n- NFC: st21nfca: Fix memory leak in device probe and remove\n  (CVE-2021-46924 bsc#1220459).\n- commit 2b46faa\n\n- Update patch reference for HID fix (CVE-2021-46906 bsc#1220421)\n- commit 89e5504\n\n- i2c: Fix a potential use after free (bsc#1220409\n  CVE-2019-25162).\n- commit 6421697\n\n- i2c: cadence: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails\n  (bsc#1220570 CVE-2020-36784).\n- commit 5fa02fa\n\n- KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_\n  sync'ing SRCU (bsc#git-fixes, CVE-2021-47061).\n- commit b2a896d\n\n- Update patch reference for media usb fix (CVE-2020-36777 bsc#1220526)\n- commit f0fcd0d\n\n- media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnection\n  (CVE-2023-52445 bsc#1220241).\n- commit 3f02f88\n\n- nfc: nci: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in\n  send_acknowledge() (bsc#1219125 CVE-2023-46343).\n- commit 9371a32\n\n- uio: Fix use-after-free in uio_open (bsc#1220140\n  CVE-2023-52439).\n- commit 758615f\n\n- apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty\n  (CVE-2023-52443 bsc#1220240).\n- commit 9d07817\n\n- sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier\n  (git-fixes, bsc#1220398, CVE-2024-26602).\n- commit b645222\n\n- i2c: i801: Fix block process call transactions (bsc#1220009\n  CVE-2024-26593).\n- commit c348c97\n\n- netfilter: nftables: avoid overflows in nft_hash_buckets()\n  (CVE-2021-47013 bsc#1220641).\n- commit f0d286e\n\n- net:emac/emac-mac: Fix a use after free in emac_mac_tx_buf_send\n  (CVE-2021-47013 bsc#1220641).\n- commit 378bb67\n\n- mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption (bsc#1220243\n  CVE-2024-26586).\n- mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix NULL pointer dereference in\n  error path (bsc#1220344 CVE-2024-26595).\n- commit 76ed3a3\n\n- EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access (bsc#1220330)\n- commit 5f2e003\n\n- gfs2: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_rgrp_dump\n  (bsc#1220253 CVE-2023-52448).\n- commit a731316\n\n- rpm templates: Always define usrmerged\n  usrmerged is now defined in kernel-spec-macros and not the distribution.\n  Only check if it's defined in kernel-spec-macros, not everywhere where\n  it's used.\n- commit a6ad8af\n\n- KVM: x86: work around QEMU issue with synthetic CPUID leaves (git-fixes).\n- commit fda6073\n\n- blacklist.conf: Blacklist a clang fix\n- commit 6540830\n\n- rpm templates: Move macro definitions below buildrequires\n  Many of the rpm macros defined in the kernel packages depend directly or\n  indirectly on script execution.

This results in no script generated as\n  output, and printing the initial values of the shell variables as\n  the patchversion.\n  When the awk program fails to run produce 'exit 1' as the shell script\n  to run instead. That prevents printing the stale values, generates no\n  output, and generates invalid rpm spec file down the line. Then the\n  problem is flagged early and should be easier to diagnose.\n- commit 8ef8383\n\n- x86/cpu, kvm: Move X86_FEATURE_LFENCE_RDTSC to its native leaf (git-fixes).\n- commit 6d2e676\n\n- KVM: x86: Move open-coded CPUID leaf 0x80000021 EAX bit propagation  code (git-fixes).\n- commit 1f3dbeb\n\n- KVM: x86: synthesize CPUID leaf 0x80000021h if useful (git-fixes).\n- commit 2581a0e\n\n- KVM: x86: add support for CPUID leaf 0x80000021 (git-fixes).\n- commit 79ab1f6\n\n- x86/asm: Add _ASM_RIP() macro for x86-64 (%rip) suffix (git-fixes).\n- commit 26d80bf\n\n- KVM: VMX: Move VERW closer to VMentry for MDS mitigation (git-fixes).\n- KVM: VMX: Use BT+JNC, i.e. EFLAGS.CF to select VMRESUME vs. VMLAUNCH (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Use ALTERNATIVE() instead of mds_user_clear static key (git-fixes).\n  Also add the removed mds_user_clear symbol to kABI severities as it is\n  exposed just for KVM module and is generally a core kernel component so\n  removing it is low risk.\n- x86/entry_32: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition (git-fixes).\n- x86/bugs: Add asm helpers for executing VERW (git-fixes).\n- commit 8f33ff8\n\n- mbcache: Fixup kABI of mb_cache_entry (bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915).\n- commit 52b181f\n\n- ext4: fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption\n  (bsc#1207653 bsc#1219915).\n- commit 14e0a9c\n\n- net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv\n  (bsc#1219127 CVE-2024-23849).\n- commit 75b4a5b\n\n- cifs: fix missing unload_nls() in smb2_reconnect()\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- commit 7236d05\n\n- cifs: fix status checks in cifs_tree_connect (bsc#1213476).\n- commit a4a76da\n\n- smb: client: fix null auth (bsc#1213476).\n- commit 08d9d59\n\n- kernel-binary: Move build script to the end\n  All other spec templates have the build script at the end, only\n  kernel-binary has it in the middle.

It was introduced in 2010 but haven't received\n  any updates on any branch since 2015. The file is renamed by tar-up.sh\n  to config-options.changes.txt and shipped in the kernel-source RPM\n  package under /usr/share/doc. As its content now only contains outdated\n  information, retaining it can lead to confusion for users encountering\n  this file.\n  Config changes are nowadays described in associated Git commit messages,\n  which get automatically collected and are incorporated into changelogs\n  of kernel RPM packages.\n  Drop then this obsolete file, starting with its packaging logic.\n  For branch maintainers: Upon merging this commit on your branch, please\n  correspondingly delete the file doc/config-options.changes.\n- commit adedbd2\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Simplify the list of references (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Reduce indentation in the list of references, make the style consistent\n  with README.md.\n- commit 70e3c33\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Add how to update the config for module signing\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Configuration files for SUSE kernels include settings to integrate with\n  signing support provided by the Open Build Service. This creates\n  problems if someone tries to use such a configuration file to build\n  a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; kernel as described in doc/README.SUSE:\n  * Default configuration files available in the kernel-source repository\n  unset CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL to leave module signing to\n  pesign-obs-integration. In case of a \u0026quot;standalone\u0026quot; build, this\n  integration is not available and the modules don't get signed.\n  * The kernel spec file overrides CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY to\n  \u0026quot;.kernel_signing_key.pem\u0026quot; which is a file populated by certificates\n  provided by OBS but otherwise not available. The value ends up in\n  /boot/config-$VERSION-$RELEASE-$FLAVOR and /proc/config.gz. If someone\n  decides to use one of these files as their base configuration then the\n  build fails with an error because the specified module signing key is\n  missing.\n  Add information on how to enable module signing and where to find the\n  relevant upstream documentation.\n- commit a699dc3\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Remove how to build modules using kernel-source\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n  Remove the first method how to build kernel modules from the readme. It\n  describes a process consisting of the kernel-source installation,\n  configuring this kernel and then performing an ad-hoc module build.\n  This method is not ideal as no modversion data is involved in the\n  process. It results in a module with no symbol CRCs which can be wrongly\n  loaded on an incompatible kernel.\n  Removing the method also simplifies the readme because only two main\n  methods how to build the modules are then described, either doing an\n  ad-hoc build using kernel-devel, or creating a proper Kernel Module\n  Package.\n- commit 9285bb8\n\n- net: mana: Configure hwc timeout from hardware (bsc#1214037).\n- net: mana: Fix MANA VF unload when hardware is unresponsive\n  (bsc#1214764).\n- commit b006ee9\n\n- Call flush_delayed_fput() from nfsd main-loop (bsc#1217408).\n- commit f407bf4\n\n- powerpc: Don't clobber f0/vs0 during fp|altivec register save\n  (bsc#1217780).\n- commit 96932d7\n\n- netfilter: conntrack: dccp: copy entire header to stack buffer,\n  not just basic one (CVE-2023-39197 bsc#1216976).\n- commit 5e51ad1\n\n- kernel-binary: suse-module-tools is also required when installed\n  Requires(pre) adds dependency for the specific sciptlet.\n  However, suse-module-tools also ships modprobe.d files which may be\n  needed at posttrans time or any time the kernel is on the system for\n  generating ramdisk.

(bsc#1214344)\n  To protect itself against userspace corrupting the counter of io_uring\n  dropped submission entries, the kernel relies on a cache of the counter\n  instead of reading the counter directly.  But, the stable patch that was\n  brought to SP3 implementing the this mechanism was done incorrectly, and\n  let's the kernel read from the userspace value instead of the cache in\n  one situation. This allows userspace to subvert the counter, hanging the\n  application forever. Fix the backport to read from the cached value.\n  5.3 stable is long dead, so there is nothing to fix upstream or in\n  - stable.\n- commit 2f88408\n\n- ibmvfc: make 'max_sectors' a module option (bsc#1216223).\n- commit ecc46dc\n\n- scsi: Update max_hw_sectors on rescan (bsc#1216223).\n- commit 2c4e392\n\n- nvme-fc: Prevent null pointer dereference in\n  nvme_fc_io_getuuid() (bsc#1214842).\n- commit b96c59b\n\n- ubi: Refuse attaching if mtd's erasesize is 0 (CVE-2023-31085\n  bsc#1210778).\n- commit cf2c572\n\n- bpf: propagate precision in ALU/ALU64 operations (git-fixes).\n- commit 3cd9fd7\n\n- USB: ene_usb6250: Allocate enough memory for full object\n  (bsc#1216051 CVE-2023-45862).\n- commit 850ea88\n\n- bpf: Fix incorrect verifier pruning due to missing register\n  precision taints (bsc#1215518 CVE-2023-2163).\n- commit 37a3998\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: skip bound chain on rule flush\n  (CVE-2023-3777 bsc#1215095).\n- commit 5558be6\n\n- xen/events: replace evtchn_rwlock with RCU (bsc#1215745,\n  xsa-441, cve-2023-34324).\n- commit 4227b23\n\n- KVM: x86: fix sending PV IPI (git-fixes, bsc#1210853,\n  bsc#1216134).\n- commit 8704b8e\n\n- netfilter: nfnetlink_osf: avoid OOB read (bsc#1216046\n  CVE-2023-39189).\n- commit c154d64\n\n- btrfs: unset reloc control if transaction commit fails in prepare_to_relocate() (bsc#1212051 CVE-2023-3111).\n- commit 2048118\n\n- doc/README.PATCH-POLICY.SUSE: Convert the document to Markdown\n  (jsc#PED-5021)\n- commit c05cfc9\n\n- doc/README.SUSE: Convert the document to Markdown (jsc#PED-5021)\n- commit bff5e3e\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/ipv6-sr-fix-out-of-bounds-read-when-setting-HMAC-dat.patch\n  (bsc#1211592 CVE-2023-2860).\n- commit 267cf38\n\n- net: xfrm: Fix xfrm_address_filter OOB read (CVE-2023-39194\n  bsc#1215861).\n- commit 1bf7dab\n\n- netfilter: xt_sctp: validate the flag_info count (CVE-2023-39193\n  bsc#1215860).\n- commit 6fc23b4\n\n- netfilter: xt_u32: validate user space input (CVE-2023-39192\n  bsc#1215858).\n- commit 5f8a021\n\n- ipv4: fix null-deref in ipv4_link_failure (CVE-2023-42754\n  bsc#1215467).\n- commit ecc7c7a\n\n- btrfs: fix root ref counts in error handling in\n  btrfs_get_root_ref (bsc#1214351 CVE-2023-4389).\n- commit 14e72e8\n\n- Revert rwsem backport (bsc#1207270 jsc#PED-4567)\n  The rwsem backport enabled database software to run on largest VMs in\n  Azure (M416v2, M832v2).

This override is then used instead of an\n  actual type and allows to preserve modversions (CRCs) of symbols that\n  reference the type. It is kind of an alternative to doing kABI fix-ups\n  with '#ifndef __GENKSYMS__'. The functionality is hidden behind the\n  genksyms --preserve option which primarily tells the tool to strictly\n  verify modversions against a given reference file or fail.\n  Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff which is\n  present in various kernel-source branches separates the override logic.\n  It allows it to be enabled with a new --override flag and used without\n  specifying the --preserve option. Setting KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 in the spec\n  file is then a way how the build is told that --override should be\n  passed to all invocations of genksyms. This was needed for SUSE kernels\n  because their build doesn't use --preserve but instead resulting CRCs\n  are later checked by scripts/kabi.pl.\n  However, this override functionality was not utilized much in practice\n  and the only use currently to be found is in SLE11-SP1-LTSS. It means\n  that no one should miss this option and KBUILD_OVERRIDE=1 together with\n  patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be removed.\n  Notes for maintainers merging this commit to their branches:\n  * Downstream patch patches.suse/genksyms-add-override-flag.diff can be\n  dropped after merging this commit.\n  * Branch SLE11-SP1-LTSS uses the mentioned override functionality and\n  this commit should not be merged to it, or needs to be reverted\n  afterwards.\n- commit 4aa02b8\n\n- cifs: do all necessary checks for credits within or before\n  locking (bsc#1213476).\n- commit ce2dc27\n\n- cifs: avoid use of global locks for high contention data\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- Refresh patches.suse/cifs-set-resolved-ip-in-sockaddr.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/cifs-Fix-UAF-in-cifs_demultiplex_thread-.patch.\n- commit 7ce18a4\n\n- cifs: get rid of mount options string parsing (bsc#1213476).\n- commit a615bd3\n\n- cifs: use fs_context for automounts (bsc#1213476).\n- commit 231aad6\n\n- cifs: set correct ipc status after initial tree connect\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/cifs-set-correct-tcon-status-after-initial-tree-connect.patch.\n- commit abf3572\n\n- cifs: set correct tcon status after initial tree connect\n  (bsc#1213476).\n- commit a4030d4\n\n- Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free in l2cap_sock_ready_cb\n  (bsc#1214233 CVE-2023-40283).\n- commit 11dc4cc\n\n- Refresh patches.suse/powerpc-Move-DMA64_PROPNAME-define-to-a-header.patch.\n- commit d263157\n\n- x86/speculation: Mark all Skylake CPUs as vulnerable to GDS (git-fixes).\n- commit a3ff58c\n\n- drm/vmwgfx: Test shader type against SVGA3d_SHADERTYPE_MIN (bsc#1203517 CVE-2022-36402)\n- commit 5b2dbae\n\n- cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread() (bsc#1208995\n  CVE-2023-1192).\n- commit 87f52bf\n\n- powerpc/rtas: remove ibm_suspend_me_token (bsc#1023051).\n- commit 4f01e57\n\n- Do not add and remove genksyms ifdefs\n- Refresh patches.kabi/lockdown-kABI-workaround-for-lockdown_reason-changes.patch.\n- Refresh patches.suse/lockdown-also-lock-down-previous-kgdb-use.patch.\n- commit e497b88\n\n- powerpc/rtas: move syscall filter setup into separate function\n  (bsc#1023051).\n- commit a36442d\n\n- rpm/mkspec-dtb: support for nested subdirs\n  Commit 724ba6751532 (\u0026quot;ARM: dts: Move .dts files to vendor\n  sub-directories\u0026quot;) moved the dts to nested subdirs, add a support for\n  that.

Separate the two while also making\n  the latter more generic.\n  $build_dtbs is enabled on every single rt and azure branch since 15.3\n  when the setting was introduced, gate on the new $obs_build_variant\n  setting as well.\n- commit 36ba909\n\n- series.conf: cleanup\n- update upstream references and resort:\n  - patches.suse/wifi-cfg80211-avoid-nontransmitted-BSS-list-corrupti.patch\n- commit 9bae747\n\n- net/ulp: use consistent error code when blocking ULP\n  (CVE-2023-0461 bsc#1208787).\n- net/ulp: prevent ULP without clone op from entering the LISTEN\n  status (CVE-2023-0461 bsc#1208787).\n- commit 028f0fd\n\n- rpm/constraints.in: increase the disk size for armv6/7 to 24GB\n  It grows and the build fails recently on SLE15-SP4/5.\n- commit 41ac816\n\n- rpm/check-for-config-changes: add TOOLCHAIN_NEEDS_* to IGNORED_CONFIGS_RE\n  This new form was added in commit e89c2e815e76 (\u0026quot;riscv: Handle\n  zicsr/zifencei issues between clang and binutils\u0026quot;).\n- commit 234baea\n\n- seq_buf: Fix overflow in seq_buf_putmem_hex() (bsc#1209549\n  CVE-2023-28772).\n- commit 5c5e4d3\n\n- PCI: hv: Add a per-bus mutex state_lock (bsc#1209785).\n- Revert \u0026quot;PCI: hv: Fix a timing issue which causes kdump to fail\n  occasionally\u0026quot; (bsc#1209785).\n- PCI: hv: Remove the useless hv_pcichild_state from struct\n  hv_pci_dev (bsc#1209785).\n- PCI: hv: Fix a race condition in hv_irq_unmask() that can\n  cause panic (bsc#1209785).\n- PCI: hv: fix a race condition bug in hv_pci_query_relations()\n  (bsc#1209785).\n- commit 6b9e385\n\n- kvm: initialize all of the kvm_debugregs structure before\n  sending it to userspace (bsc#1209532 CVE-2023-1513).\n- commit bd9c11d\n\n- Bluetooth: Fix double free in hci_conn_cleanup (bsc#1209052\n  CVE-2023-28464).\n- commit 677d920\n\n- net: tls: fix possible race condition between\n  do_tls_getsockopt_conf() and do_tls_setsockopt_conf()\n  (bsc#1209366 CVE-2023-28466).\n- commit 5f7c4a6\n\n- Move ENA upstream fix to sorted section.\n- commit aff6c71\n\n- RDMA/core: Don't infoleak GRH fields (bsc#1209778 CVE-2021-3923)\n- commit 50ba48b\n\n- sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()\n  (CVE-2023-52707 bsc#1225109).\n- commit 25893f2\n\n- tipc: fix NULL deref in tipc_link_xmit() (bsc#1209289\n  CVE-2023-1390).\n- commit b2c1533\n\n- tun: avoid double free in tun_free_netdev (bsc#1209635\n  CVE-2022-4744).\n- commit c5cf205\n\n- net/sched: tcindex: update imperfect hash filters respecting\n  rcu (CVE-2023-1281 bsc#1209634).\n- commit 97b3f9d\n\n- fs/proc: task_mmu.c: don't read mapcount for migration entry\n  (CVE-2023-1582, bsc#1209636).\n- commit 35d5c42\n\n- af_unix: Get user_ns from in_skb in unix_diag_get_exact()\n  (bsc#1209290 CVE-2023-28327).\n- commit 000517c\n\n- netlink: prevent potential spectre v1 gadgets (bsc#1209547\n  CVE-2017-5753).\n- commit cec3f24\n\n- tipc: add an extra conn_get in tipc_conn_alloc (bsc#1209288\n  CVE-2023-1382).\n- commit 6a58da4\n\n- tipc: set con sock in tipc_conn_alloc (bsc#1209288\n  CVE-2023-1382).\n- commit 06eaf34\n\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/sctp-fail-if-no-bound-addresses-can-be-used-for-a-gi.patch.\n- commit 890554b\n\n- media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in  az6027_i2c_xfer()\n  (bsc#1209291 CVE-2023-28328).\n- commit af7b7eb\n\n- rpm/group-source-files.pl: Fix output difference when / is in location\n  While previous attempt to fix group-source-files.pl in 6d651362c38\n  \u0026quot;rpm/group-source-files.pl: Deal with {pre,post}fixed / in location\u0026quot;\n  breaks the infinite loop, it does not properly address the issue.

Supplying\n    a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will simply cause\n    DH_check() to fail.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-3446.patch openssl-CVE-2023-3446-test.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Reworked the Fix for the Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n    The previous fix for this timing side channel turned out to cause\n    a severe 2-3x performance regression in the typical use case\n    compared to 1.1.1s.\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2022-4304.patch\n  * Removed patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n  * Refreshed openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n\n- Update further expiring certificates that affect tests [bsc#1201627]\n  * Add openssl-Update-further-expiring-certificates.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430]\n  * Possible DoS translating ASN.1 object identifiers\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-2650.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0465, bsc#1209878]\n  * Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0465.patch\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0466, bsc#1209873]\n  * Certificate policy check not enabled\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0466.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [CVE-2023-0464, bsc#1209624]\n  * Excessive Resource Usage Verifying X.509 Policy Constraints\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0464.patch\n\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207533, CVE-2023-0286]\n  * Fix X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GENERAL_NAME_cmp\n    for x400Address\n  * Add openssl-CVE-2023-0286.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207536, CVE-2023-0215]\n  * Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF()\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-1of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-2of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-3of4.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2023-0215-4of4.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207538, CVE-2022-4450]\n  * Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex()\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4450-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4450-2of2.patch\n- Security Fix: [bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304]\n  * Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption\n  * Add patches:\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-1of2.patch\n  - openssl-CVE-2022-4304-2of2.patch\n\n- FIPS: list only FIPS approved public key algorithms\n  [bsc#1121365, bsc#1198472]\n  * Add openssl-1_1-fips-list-only-approved-pubkey-algorithms.patch\n\n- Added openssl-1_1-paramgen-default_to_rfc7919.patch\n  * bsc#1180995\n  * Default to RFC7919 groups when generating ECDH parameters\n    using 'genpkey' or 'dhparam' in FIPS mode.\n\n- Fix memory leaks introduced by openssl-1.1.1-fips.patch [bsc#1203046]\n  * Add patch openssl-1.1.1-fips-fix-memory-leaks.patch\n\nPackage parted was updated:\n\n- fix null pointer dereference (bsc#1193412)  - add: parted-fix-check-diskp-in-do_name.patch\n- update mkpart options in manpage (bsc#1182142)\n  - add: parted-mkpart-manpage.patch\n\nPackage pciutils was updated:\n\n- Apply \u0026quot;lspci-Fixed-buffer-overflows-in-ls-tree.c.patch\u0026quot; to fix a  buffer overflow error that would cause lspci to crash on systems\n  with complex topologies.

openSUSE/zypper#546)\n- version 17.32.6 (32)\n\n- Don't try to refresh volatile media as long as raw metadata are\n  present (bsc#1223094)\n- version 17.32.5 (32)\n\n- Fix creation of sibling cache dirs with too restrictive mode\n  (bsc#1222398)\n  Some install workflows in YAST may lead to too restrictive (0700)\n  raw cache directories in case of newly created repos. Later\n  commands running with user privileges may not be able to access\n  these repos.\n- version 17.32.4 (32)\n\n- Update RepoStatus fromCookieFile according to the files mtime\n  (bsc#1222086)\n- TmpFile: Don't call chmod if makeSibling failed.\n- version 17.32.3 (32)\n\n- Fixup New VendorSupportOption flag VendorSupportSuperseded\n  (jsc#OBS-301, jsc#PED-8014)\n  Fixed the name of the keyword to \u0026quot;support_superseded\u0026quot; as it was\n  agreed on in jsc#OBS-301.\n- version 17.32.2 (32)\n\n- Add resolver option 'removeUnneeded' to file weak remove jobs\n  for unneeded packages (bsc#1175678)\n- version 17.32.1 (32)\n\n- Add resolver option 'removeOrphaned' for distupgrade\n  (bsc#1221525)\n- New VendorSupportOption flag VendorSupportSuperseded\n  (jsc#OBS-301, jsc#PED-8014)\n- Tests: fix vsftpd.conf where SUSE and Fedora use different\n  defaults (fixes #522)\n- Add default stripe minimum (#529)\n- Don't expose std::optional where YAST/PK explicitly use c++11.\n- Digest: Avoid using the deprecated OPENSSL_config.\n- version 17.32.0 (32)\n\n- ProblemSolution::skipsPatchesOnly overload to handout the\n  patches.\n- Remove https-\u0026gt;http redirection exceptions for\n  download.opensuse.org.\n- version 17.31.32 (22)\n\n- tui: allow to access the underlying ostream of out::Info.\n- Add MLSep: Helper to produce not-NL-terminated multi line\n  output.\n- version 17.31.31 (22)\n\n- applydeltaprm: Create target directory if it does not exist\n  (bsc#1219442)\n- Add ProblemSolution::skipsPatchesOnly (for openSUSE/zypper#514)\n- Fix problems with EINTR in ExternalDataSource::getline (fixes\n  bsc#1215698)\n- version 17.31.30 (22)\n\n- CheckAccessDeleted: fix running_in_container detection\n  (bsc#1218782)\n- Detect CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS_STR availability at runtime\n  (bsc#1218831)\n- Make Wakeup class EINTR safe.\n- Add a way to cancel media operations on shutdown\n  (openSUSE/zypper#522)\n  This patch adds a mechanism to signal libzypp that a shutdown was\n  requested, usually when CTRL+C was pressed by the user. Currently\n  only the media backend will utilize this, but can be extended to\n  all code paths that use g_poll() to wait for events.\n- Manually poll fds for curl in MediaCurl.\n  Using curl_easy_perform does not give us the required control on\n  when we want to cancel a download. Switching to the MultiCurl\n  implementation with a external poll() event loop will give us\n  much more freedom and helps us to improve our Ctrl+C handling.\n- Move reusable curl poll code to curlhelper.h.\n- version 17.31.29 (22)\n\n- Fix to build with libxml 2.12.x (fixes #505)\n- version 17.31.28 (22)\n\n- CheckAccessDeleted: fix 'running in container' filter\n  (bsc#1218291)\n- version 17.31.27 (22)\n\n- Call zypp commit plugins during transactional update (fixes #506)\n- Add support for loongarch64 (fixes #504)\n- Teach MediaMultiCurl to download HTTP Multibyte ranges.\n- Teach zsync downloads to MultiCurl.\n- Expand RepoVars in URLs downloading a .repo file (bsc#1212160)\n  Convenient and helps documentation as it may refer to a single\n  command for a bunch of distributions. Like e.g. \u0026quot;zypper ar\n  'https://server.my/$releasever/my.repo'\u0026quot;.\n- version 17.31.26 (22)\n\n- Fix build issue with zchunk build flags (fixes #500)\n- version 17.31.25 (22)\n\n- Open rpmdb just once during execution of %posttrans scripts\n  (bsc#1216412)\n- Avoid using select() since it does not support fd numbers \u0026gt;\n  1024 (fixes #447)\n- tools/DownloadFiles: use standard zypp progress bar (fixes #489)\n- Revert \u0026quot;Color download progress bar\u0026quot; (fixes #475)\n  Cyan is already used for the output of RPM scriptlets. Avoid this\n  colorific collision between download progress bar and scriptlet\n  output.\n- Fix ProgressBar's calculation of the printed tag position (fixes #494)\n- Switch zypp::Digest to Openssl 3.0 Provider API (fixes #144)\n- Fix usage of deprecated CURL features (fixes #486)\n- version 17.31.24 (22)\n\n- Stop using boost version 1 timer library (fixes #489,\n  bsc#1215294)\n- version 17.31.23 (22)\n\n- Preliminary disable 'rpm --runposttrans' usage for chrooted\n  systems (bsc#1216091)\n  This limits the %transfiletrigger(postun|in) support in the\n  default installer if --root is used (as described in bsc#1041742).\n  The chrooted execution of the scripts in 'rpm --runposttrans'\n  broke in rpm-4.18. It's expected to be fixed in rpm-4.19.\n  Then we'll enable the feature again.\n- fix comment typo on zypp.conf (boo#1215979)\n- version 17.31.22 (22)\n\n- Attempt to delay %transfiletrigger(postun|in) execution if rpm\n  supports it (bsc#1041742)\n  Decide during installation whether rpm is capable of delayed\n  %posttrans %transfiletrigger(postun|in) execution or whether we\n  can just handle the packages %posttrans. On TW a delayed\n  %transfiletrigger handling is possible since rpm-4.17.\n- Make sure the old target is deleted before a new one is created\n  (bsc#1203760)\n- version 17.31.21 (22)\n\n- Fixup changes for 17.31.16. Remove faulty reference to a bug\n  actually fixed in 2019.\n- version 17.31.20 (22)\n\n- Fix zypp-tui/output/Out.h to build with clang.\n- Fix zypp/Arch.h for clang (fixes #478)\n  Clang seems to have issues with picking the overload in\n  std::men_fn if there is a static overload of a member function.\n  We need to explicitely specify the correct type of the function\n  pointer. To make sure this would not break compiling a\n  application with clang that builds against libzypp this patch\n  works around the problem.\n- version 17.31.19 (22)\n\n- SINGLE_RPMTRANS: Respect ZYPP_READONLY_HACK when checking the\n  zypp-rpm lock (fixes openSUSE/openSUSE-repos#29)\n- version 17.31.18 (22)\n\n- Fix wrong filesize exceeded dl abort in zyppng::Downloader\n  (bsc#1213673)\n  In some cases when downloading very small files we can run into\n  issues when the URL is protected by credentials.\n- version 17.31.17 (22)\n\n- Fix negative ZYPP_LOCK_TIMEOUT not waiting forever (bsc#1213231)\n- Don't cleanup orphaned dirs if read-only mode was promised\n  (bsc#1210740)\n- version 17.31.16 (22)\n\n- Fix build against protobuf \u0026gt;= 22 (fixes #465, closes #466)\n  Port away from protobuf_generate_cpp. Upstream protobuf does not\n  export protobuf_generate_cpp by default anymore.\n  Use protobuf_generate instead, which is also available on older\n  versions.\n- Remove SUSE \u0026lt; SLE11 constructs (fixes #464).\n- version 17.31.15 (22)\n\n- build: honor libproxy.pc's includedir (bsc#1212222)\n- Curl: trim all custom headers (bsc#1212187)\n  HTTP/2 RFC 9113 forbids fields ending with a space. So we make\n  sure all custom headers are trimmed. This also includes headers\n  returned by URL-Resolver plugins.\n- version 17.31.14 (22)\n\n- curl: Trim user agent string (bsc#1212187)\n  HTTP/2 RFC 9113 forbids fields ending with a space. Violation\n  results in curl error: 92: HTTP/2 PROTOCOL_ERROR.\n- version 17.31.13 (22)\n\n- Do not unconditionally release a medium if provideFile failed\n  (bsc#1211661)\n- libzypp.spec.cmake: remove duplicate file listing.\n- version 17.31.12 (22)\n\n- MediaCurl: Fix endless loop if wrong credentials are stored in\n  credentials.cat (bsc#1210870)\n  Since libzypp-17.31.7 wrong credentials stored in credentials.cat\n  may lead to an endless loop. Rather than asking for the right\n  credentials, the stored ones are used again and again.\n- zypp.conf: Introduce 'download.connect_timeout' [60 sec.]\n  (bsc#1208329)\n  Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection phase to\n  the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, it has\n  no impact once it has connected. (see also CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT)\n- commit: Try to provide /dev fs if not present (fixes #444)\n- fix build with boost 1.82.\n- version 17.31.11 (22)\n\n- fix build with boost 1.82\n\n- BuildRequires: libsolv-devel \u0026gt;= 0.7.24 for x86_64_v[234]\n  support.\n- version 17.31.10 (22)\n\n- Workround bsc#1195633 while libsolv \u0026lt;= 0.7.23 is used.\n- Fix potential endless loop in new ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK.\n- ZYPP_METALINK_DEBUG=1: Log URL and priority of the mirrors\n  parsed from a metalink file.\n- multicurl: propagate ssl settings stored in repo url\n  (boo#1127591)\n  Closes #335.\n- Teach MediaNetwork to retry on HTTP2 errors.\n- fix CapDetail to return Rel::NONE if an EXPRESSION is used as a\n  NAMED cap.\n- Capability: support parsing richdeps from string.\n- defaultLoadSystem: default to LS_NOREFRESH if not root.\n- Detect x86_64_v[234]: Fix LZCNT bit used in detection (fixes\n  [#439])\n  Merges rpm-software-management/rpm#2412: The bit for LZCNT is in\n  CPUID 0x80000001, not 1.\n- Detect x86_64_v[234] architecture levels (fixes #439)\n- Support x86_64_v[234] architecture levels (for #439)\n- version 17.31.9 (22)\n\n- ProgressData: enforce reporting the INIT||END state\n  (bsc#1206949)\n- ps: fix service detection on newer Tumbleweed systems\n  (bsc#1205636)\n- version 17.31.8 (22)\n\n- Hint to \u0026quot;zypper removeptf\u0026quot; to remove PTFs.\n- Removing a PTF without enabled repos should always fail\n  (bsc#1203248)\n  Without enabled repos, the dependent PTF-packages would be\n  removed (not replaced!) as well. To remove a PTF \u0026quot;zypper install\n  - - -PTF\u0026quot; or a dedicated \u0026quot;zypper removeptf PTF\u0026quot; should be used.\n  This will update the installed PTF packages to theit latest\n  version.\n- version 17.31.7 (22)\n\n- Avoid calling getsockopt when we know the info already.\n  This patch hopefully fixes logging on WSL, getsockopt seems to\n  not be fully supported but the code required it when accepting\n  new socket connections. (for bsc#1178233)\n- Enhance yaml-cpp detection (fixes #428)\n- No need to redirect 'history.logfile=/dev/null' into the target.\n- MultiCurl: Make sure to reset the progress function when\n  falling back.\n- version 17.31.6 (22)\n\n- Create '.no_auto_prune' in the package cache dir to prevent auto\n  cleanup of orphaned repositories (bsc#1204956)\n- properly reset range requests (bsc#1204548)\n- version 17.31.5 (22)\n\n- Do not clean up MediaSetAccess before using the geoip file\n  (fixes #424)\n- version 17.31.4 (22)\n\n- Improve download of optional files (fixes #416)\n- Do not use geoip rewrites if the repo has explicit country\n  settings.\n- Implement geoIP feature for zypp.\n  This patch adds a feature to rewrite request URLs to the repo\n  servers by querying a geoIP file from download.opensuse.org. This\n  file can return a redirection target depending on the clients IP\n  adress, this way we can directly contact a local mirror of d.o.o\n  instead. The redir target stays valid for 24hrs.\n  This feature can be disabled in zypp.conf by setting\n  'download.use_geoip_mirror = false'.\n- Use a dynamic fallback for BLKSIZE in downloads.\n  When not receiving a blocklist via metalink file from the server\n  MediaMultiCurl used to fallback to a fixed, relatively small\n  BLKSIZE. This patch changes the fallback into a dynamic value\n  based on the filesize using a similar metric as the MirrorCache\n  implementation on the server side.\n- Skip media.1/media download for http repo status calc.\n  This patch allows zypp to skip a extra media.1/media download to\n  calculate if a repository needs to be refreshed. This\n  optimisation only takes place if the repo does specify only\n  downloading base urls.\n- version 17.31.3 (22)\n\nPackage shadow was updated:\n\n- bsc#1228770: Fix not copying of skel files  Update shadow-CVE-2013-4235.patch\n\n- bsc#916845 (CVE-2013-4235): Fix TOCTOU race condition\n  Add shadow-CVE-2013-4235.patch\n\n- bsc#1214806 (CVE-2023-4641):\n  Fix potential password leak\n- Add shadow-CVE-2023-4641.patch\n\n- bsc#1213189: Change lock mechanism to file locking to prevent\n  lock files after power interruptions\n- Add shadow-4.8.1-lock-mechanism.patch\n\n- bsc#1206627: Add --prefix support to passwd, chpasswd and chage\n  Needed for YaST\n- Add shadow-4.8.1-add-prefix-passwd-chpasswd-chage.patch\n\n- bsc#1210507 (CVE-2023-29383):\n  Check for control characters\n- Add shadow-CVE-2023-29383.patch\n\nPackage man was updated:\n\n- Use inverted exit status in exec option of find command to  avoid refreshing man database (boo#1155879)\n\n- Minor corrections on %ghost /var/cache/man\n\nPackage mozilla-nspr was updated:\n\n- update to version 4.35  * fixes for building with clang\n  * use the number of online processors for the\n    PR_GetNumberOfProcessors() API on some platforms\n  * fix build on mips+musl libc\n  * Add support for the LoongArch 64-bit architecture\n\nPackage netcfg was updated:\n\nPackage nfs-utils was updated:\n\n- Add 0032-exportfs-Ingnore-export-failures-in-nfs-server.seriv.patch  Inconsistencies in /etc/exports shouldn't be fatal.\n  (bsc#1212594)\n\n- Add 0030-systemd-use-correct-modprobe-d-directory\n  SLE15-SP5 an earlier don't use /usr/lib/modprobe.d\n  (bsc#1200710)\n- Add 0031-mountd-don-t-advertise-krb5-for-v4root-when-not-conf.patch\n  Avoid unhelpful warning if rpcsec_gss_krb5.ko not installed\n\n- Add 0028-mount.nfs-always-include-mountpoint-or-spec-if-error.patch\n  boo#1157881\n- Add 0029-nfsd.man-fix-typo-in-section-on-scope.patch\n  bsc#1209859\n- Allow scope to be set in sysconfig: NFSD_SCOPE\n\n- Rename all drop-in options.conf files as 10-options.conf\n  This makes it easier for other packages to over-ride\n  with a drop-in with a later sequence number.\n  resource-agents does this.\n  (bsc#1207843)\n\n- 0026-modprobe-avoid-error-messages-if-sbin-sysctl-fail.patch\n  Avoid modprobe errors when sysctl is not installed.\n  (bsc#1200710 bsc#1207022 bsc#1206781)\n- 0027-nfsd-allow-server-scope-to-be-set-with-config-or-com.patch\n  Add \u0026quot;-S scope\u0026quot; option to rpc.nfsd to simplify fail-over cluster\n  config.\n  (bsc#1203746)\n\n- add 0025-nfsdcltrack-getopt_long-fails-on-a-non-x86_64-archs.patch\n  Fix nfsdcltrack bug that affected non-x86 archs.\n  (bsc#1202627)\n\n- 0024-systemd-Apply-all-sysctl-settings-when-NFS-related-m.patch\n  Ensure sysctl setting work (bsc#1199856)\n\nPackage nfsidmap was updated:\n\n- 0001-Removed-some-unused-and-set-but-not-used-warnings.patch  0002-Handle-NULL-names-better.patch\n  0003-Strip-newlines-out-of-IDMAP_LOG-messages.patch\n  0004-onf_parse_line-Ignore-whitespace-at-the-beginning-of.patch\n  0005-nss.c-wrong-check-of-return-value.patch\n  0006-Fixed-a-memory-leak-nss_name_to_gid.patch\n  Various bugfixes and improvemes from upstream\n  In particular, 0001 fixes a crash that can happen when\n  a 'static' mapping is configured.\n  (bnc#1200901)\n\nPackage openssh was updated:\n\n- Add patches from upstream to change the default value of  UpdateHostKeys to Yes (unless VerifyHostKeyDNS is enabled).\n  This makes ssh update the known_hosts stored keys with all\n  published versions by the server (after it's authenticated\n  with an existing key), which will allow to identify the\n  server with a different key if the existing key is considered\n  insecure at some point in the future (bsc#1222831).\n  * 0001-upstream-enable-UpdateHostkeys-by-default-when-the.patch\n  * 0002-upstream-disable-UpdateHostkeys-by-default-if.patch\n\n- Add patches openssh-7.7p1-seccomp_getuid.patch and\n  openssh-bsc1216474-s390-leave-fds-open.patch\n  (bsc#1216474, bsc#1218871)\n\n- Fix hostbased ssh login failing occasionally with \u0026quot;signature\n  unverified: incorrect signature\u0026quot; by fixing a typo in patch\n  (bsc#1221123):\n  * openssh-7.8p1-role-mls.patch\n\n- Added openssh-cve-2023-51385.patch (bsc#1218215, CVE-2023-51385).\n  This limits the use of shell metacharacters in host- and\n  user names.\n\n- Added openssh-cve-2023-48795.patch (bsc#1217950, CVE-2023-48795).\n  This mitigates a prefix truncation attack that could be used to\n  undermine channel security.\n\n- Enhanced SELinux functionality.

(Thanks to Chris Walton.)\n  * In 1911 Miquelon adopted standard time on June 15, not May 15.\n  * The FROM and TO columns of Rule lines can no longer be \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;\n    or an abbreviation of \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot;, because TZif files do not support\n    DST rules that extend into the indefinite past - although these\n    rules were supported when TZif files had only 32-bit data, this\n    stopped working when 64-bit TZif files were introduced in 1995.\n    This should not be a problem for realistic data, since DST was\n    first used in the 20th century.  As a transition aid, FROM columns\n    like \u0026quot;minimum\u0026quot; are now diagnosed and then treated as if they were\n    the year 1900; this should suffice for TZif files on old systems\n    with only 32-bit time_t, and it is more compatible with bugs in\n    2023c-and-earlier localtime.c.  (Problem reported by Yoshito\n    Umaoka.)\n  * localtime and related functions no longer mishandle some\n    timestamps that occur about 400 years after a switch to a time\n    zone with a DST schedule.  In 2023d data this problem was visible\n    for some timestamps in November 2422, November 2822, etc. in\n    America/Ciudad_Juarez.  (Problem reported by Gilmore Davidson.)\n  * strftime %s now uses tm_gmtoff if available.  (Problem and draft\n    patch reported by Dag-Erling SmÃ¸rgrav.)\n  * The strftime man page documents which struct tm members affect\n    which conversion specs, and that tzset is called.  (Problems\n    reported by Robert Elz and Steve Summit.)\n\n- update to 2023d:\n  * Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland changes time zones on\n    2024-03-31.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed time zones on 2023-12-18.\n  * Casey, Antarctica changed time zones five times since\n    2020.\n  * Code and data fixes for Palestine timestamps starting in\n    2072.\n  * A new data file zonenow.tab for timestamps starting now.\n  * Fix predictions for DST transitions in Palestine in\n    2072-2075, correcting a typo introduced in 2023a.\n  * Vostok, Antarctica changed to +05 on 2023-12-18.  It had\n    been at +07 (not +06) for years.\n  * Change data for Casey, Antarctica to agree with\n    timeanddate.com, by adding five time zone changes since 2020.\n    Casey is now at +08 instead of +11.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, changed\n    its standard time from -03 to -02 on 2023-03-25, not on\n    2023-10-28.\n  * localtime.c no longer mishandles TZif files that contain\n    a single transition into a DST regime.  Previously,\n    it incorrectly assumed DST was in effect before the transition\n    too.\n  * tzselect no longer creates temporary files.\n  * tzselect no longer mishandles the following:\n  * Spaces and most other special characters in BUGEMAIL,\n    PACKAGE, TZDIR, and VERSION.\n  * TZ strings when using mawk 1.4.3, which mishandles\n    regular expressions of the form /X{2,}/.\n  * ISO 6709 coordinates when using an awk that lacks the\n    GNU extension of newlines in -v option-arguments.\n  * Non UTF-8 locales when using an iconv command that\n    lacks the GNU //TRANSLIT extension.\n  * zic no longer mishandles data for Palestine after the\n    year 2075.\n- Refresh tzdata-china.diff\n\n- timezone update 2023c:\n  * Revert changes made in 2023b\n- timezone update 2023b:\n  *

US\n    will change to agree with nearby US locations on 2022-11-30.\n    The strip's western part, represented by Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, switches\n    from -06 all year to -07/-06 with US DST rules, like El Paso, TX.\n    The eastern part, represented by Ojinaga, will observe US DST next\n    year, like Presidio, TX.\n    A new Zone America/Ciudad_Juarez splits from America/Ojinaga.\n  * Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, stops observing\n    winter time after March 2023, so its daylight saving time becomes\n    standard time.\n  * Changes for pre-1996 northern Canada\n  * Update to past DST transition in Colombia (1993), Singapore\n    (1981)\n  * timegm is now supported by default\n\n- timezone update 2022f (bsc#1177460):\n  * Mexico will no longer observe DST except near the US border\n  * Chihuahua moves to year-round -06 on 2022-10-30\n  * Fiji no longer observes DST\n  * Move links to 'backward'\n  * In vanguard form, GMT is now a Zone and Etc/GMT a link\n  * zic now supports links to links, and vanguard form uses this\n  * Simplify four Ontario zones\n  * Fix a Y2438 bug when reading TZif data\n  * Enable 64-bit time_t on 32-bit glibc platforms\n  * Omit

18% reduced binary size\n\n- remove procps requires (was only for ZMD which is dropped)\n  (jsc#PED-8153)\n\n- Do not try to refresh repo metadata as non-root user\n  (bsc#1222086)\n  Instead show refresh stats and hint how to update them.\n- man: Explain how to protect orphaned packages by collecting\n  them in a plaindir repo.\n- packages: Add --autoinstalled and --userinstalled options to\n  list them.\n- Don't print 'reboot required' message if download-only or\n  dry-run (fixes #529)\n  Instead point out that a reboot would be required if the option\n  was not used.\n- Resepect zypper.conf option `showAlias` search commands\n  (bsc#1221963)\n  Repository::asUserString (or Repository::label) respects the\n  zypper.conf option, while name/alias return the property.\n- version 1.14.71\n\n- dup: New option --remove-orphaned to remove all orphaned\n  packages in dup (bsc#1221525)\n- version 1.14.70\n\n- info,summary: Support VendorSupportOption flag\n  VendorSupportSuperseded (jsc#OBS-301, jsc#PED-8014)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.32.0.\n  API cleanup and changes for VendorSupportSuperseded.\n- Show active dry-run/download-only at the commit propmpt.\n- patch: Add --skip-not-applicable-patches option (closes #514)\n- Fix printing detailed solver problem description.\n  The problem description() is one rule out possibly many in\n  completeProblemInfo() the solver has chosen to represent the\n  problem.

The original script name\n  zypper.sh is not recognized at the new location.\n- Update notes about failing signature checks (bsc#1214395)\n  It might be a transient issue if the server is in the midst of\n  receiving new data. Retry after a few minutes might work.\n- Improve the SIGINT handler to be signal safe (bsc#1214292)\n  This patch updates the SIGINT handling strategy to be signal\n  safe.

The\n  removeptf command however will aim to replace the dependant\n  packages by their official update versions.\n- patterns: Avoid dispylaing superfluous @System entries\n  (bsc#1205570)\n- version 1.14.59\n\n- Update man page and explain '.no_auto_prune' (bsc#1204956)\n- Allow to (re)add a service with the same URL (bsc#1203715)\n- Explain outdatedness of repos (fixes #463)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.31.5\n- version 1.14.58\n\n",

Furthermore,\ninterrupts are reenabled in the context of (B), and (C) fires with\nNMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI situation, something\nwe definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle.\n\nThe bug here is that spurious interrupts should never result in any\nstate change, and we should just return to the interrupted context.\nMoving the handling of spurious interrupts as early as possible in\nthe GICv3 handler fixes this issue.\n\n[maz: rewrote commit message, corrected Fixes: tag]",

In case the\nfirst extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from\nextents overflow file.\n\nIn case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which\nlocates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was\nchanged so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.\n\nRight action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size\ninside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if\nthe whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard\n(blk_cnt \u003e start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has\nunfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed\nunconditionally.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and\nthen perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so\nthat the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This\ncauses the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of\ntruncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.\n\nFix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the\nstart of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent\nrecord.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous\nplace since we're dropping -\u003etree_lock and it can cause a race condition\nand the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.\n\nAnother issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block\n(blk_cnt \u003e start) we are not holding the -\u003etree_lock.  We break out from\nthe loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not\nsure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,\nbut it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if\nthere's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in\nbalance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list\n\nA session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface \"remove_path\" that\neventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function.  The current\nrtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces and\nfrees sess-\u003estats object. Second it removes the session from the active\nlist.\n\nTherefore some functions could access non-connected session and access the\nfreed sess-\u003estats object even-if they check the session status before\naccessing the session.\n\nFor instance rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the\nsession status and try to send IO to the session.  The session status\ncould be changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch\nthe change and update the statistics information in sess-\u003estats object,\nand generate use-after-free problem.\n(see: \"RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its\nstats\")\n\nThis patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the\nsession from the active session list and then destroy the sysfs\ninterfaces.\n\nEach function still should check the session status because closing or\nerror recovery paths can change the status.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s: Fix pte update for kernel memory on radix\n\nWhen adding a PTE a ptesync is needed to order the update of the PTE\nwith subsequent accesses otherwise a spurious fault may be raised.\n\nradix__set_pte_at() does not do this for performance gains. For\nnon-kernel memory this is not an issue as any faults of this kind are\ncorrected by the page fault handler. For kernel memory these faults\nare not handled. The current solution is that there is a ptesync in\nflush_cache_vmap() which should be called when mapping from the\nvmalloc region.\n\nHowever, map_kernel_page() does not call flush_cache_vmap(). This is\ntroublesome in particular for code patching with Strict RWX on radix.\nIn do_patch_instruction() the page frame that contains the instruction\nto be patched is mapped and then immediately patched. With no ordering\nor synchronization between setting up the PTE and writing to the page\nit is possible for faults.\n\nAs the code patching is done using __put_user_asm_goto() the resulting\nfault is obscured - but using a normal store instead it can be seen:\n\n  BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0xc008000008f24a3c\n  Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000008bd74\n  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]\n  LE PAGE_SIZE=64K MMU=Radix SMP NR_CPUS=2048 NUMA PowerNV\n  Modules linked in: nop_module(PO+) [last unloaded: nop_module]\n  CPU: 4 PID: 757 Comm: sh Tainted: P           O      5.10.0-rc5-01361-ge3c1b78c8440-dirty #43\n  NIP:  c00000000008bd74 LR: c00000000008bd50 CTR: c000000000025810\n  REGS: c000000016f634a0 TRAP: 0300   Tainted: P           O       (5.10.0-rc5-01361-ge3c1b78c8440-dirty)\n  MSR:  9000000000009033 \u003cSF,HV,EE,ME,IR,DR,RI,LE\u003e  CR: 44002884  XER: 00000000\n  CFAR: c00000000007c68c DAR: c008000008f24a3c DSISR: 42000000 IRQMASK: 1\n\nThis results in the kind of issue reported here:\n  https://lore.kernel.org/linuxppc-dev/15AC5B0E-A221-4B8C-9039-FA96B8EF7C88@lca.pw/\n\nChris Riedl suggested a reliable way to reproduce the issue:\n  $ mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug\n  $ (while true; do echo function \u003e /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer ; echo nop \u003e /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer ; done) \u0026\n\nTurning ftrace on and off does a large amount of code patching which\nin usually less then 5min will crash giving a trace like:\n\n   ftrace-powerpc: (____ptrval____): replaced (4b473b11) != old (60000000)\n   ------------[ ftrace bug ]------------\n   ftrace failed to modify\n   [\u003cc000000000bf8e5c\u003e] napi_busy_loop+0xc/0x390\n    actual:   11:3b:47:4b\n   Setting ftrace call site to call ftrace function\n   ftrace record flags: 80000001\n    (1)\n    expected tramp: c00000000006c96c\n   ------------[ cut here ]------------\n   WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 809 at kernel/trace/ftrace.c:2065 ftrace_bug+0x28c/0x2e8\n   Modules linked in: nop_module(PO-) [last unloaded: nop_module]\n   CPU: 4 PID: 809 Comm: sh Tainted: P           O      5.10.0-rc5-01360-gf878ccaf250a #1\n   NIP:  c00000000024f334 LR: c00000000024f330 CTR: c0000000001a5af0\n   REGS: c000000004c8b760 TRAP: 0700   Tainted: P           O       (5.10.0-rc5-01360-gf878ccaf250a)\n   MSR:  900000000282b033 \u003cSF,HV,VEC,VSX,EE,FP,ME,IR,DR,RI,LE\u003e  CR: 28008848  XER: 20040000\n   CFAR: c0000000001a9c98 IRQMASK: 0\n   GPR00: c00000000024f330 c000000004c8b9f0 c000000002770600 0000000000000022\n   GPR04: 00000000ffff7fff c000000004c8b6d0 0000000000000027 c0000007fe9bcdd8\n   GPR08: 0000000000000023 ffffffffffffffd8 0000000000000027 c000000002613118\n   GPR12: 0000000000008000 c0000007fffdca00 0000000000000000 0000000000000000\n   GPR16: 0000000023ec37c5 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000008\n   GPR20: c000000004c8bc90 c0000000027a2d20 c000000004c8bcd0 c000000002612fe8\n   GPR24: 0000000000000038 0000000000000030 0000000000000028 0000000000000020\n   GPR28: c000000000ff1b68 c000000000bf8e5c c00000000312f700 c000000000fbb9b0\n   NIP ftrace_bug+0x28c/0x2e8\n   LR  ftrace_bug+0x288/0x2e8\n   Call T\n---truncated---",

The\nsender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send.\n\nThis leads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive\ncall might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid\naddress, causing the following crash:\n\n  RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60\n  Call Trace:\n   __x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490\n   do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9\n  RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343\n\nThe race occurs as:\n\n1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `struct\n   ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it\n   holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not\n   been overwritten.\n\n2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info-\u003ee_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and\n   do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call\n   __pipelined_op.\n\n3. Sender calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(\u0026this-\u003estate,\n   STATE_READY).  Here is where the race window begins.  (`this` is\n   `ewq_addr`.)\n\n4. If the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it\n   will see `state == STATE_READY` and break.\n\n5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed\n   to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's\n   stack.  (Although the address may not get overwritten until another\n   function happens to touch it, which means it can persist around for an\n   indefinite time.)\n\n6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a\n   `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass to\n   the wake_q_add_safe call.  In the lucky case where nothing has\n   overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr-\u003etask` is the right task_struct.\n   In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a\n   bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.\n\ndo_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after\nsetting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.\nChange __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's\ntask_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this`\nwhich sits on the receiver's stack.\n\nAs Manfred pointed out, the race potentially also exists in\nipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.

As there can be dangling\nreferences to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free\n(e.g.  when delivering signals).\n\nThis was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to\nhave been around since the conversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in\ncommit 9ec52099e4b8 (\"[PATCH] replace cad_pid by a struct pid\") from the\npre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.\n\nFix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when we\nassign it to `cad_pid`.\n\nFull KASAN splat below.\n\n   ==================================================================\n   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ns_of_pid include/linux/pid.h:153 [inline]\n   BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in task_active_pid_ns+0xc0/0xc8 kernel/pid.c:509\n   Read of size 4 at addr ffff23794dda0004 by task syz-executor.0/273\n\n   CPU: 1 PID: 273 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted 5.12.0-00001-g9aef892b2d15 #1\n   Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n   Call trace:\n    ns_of_pid include/linux/pid.h:153 [inline]\n    task_active_pid_ns+0xc0/0xc8 kernel/pid.c:509\n    do_notify_parent+0x308/0xe60 kernel/signal.c:1950\n    exit_notify kernel/exit.c:682 [inline]\n    do_exit+0x2334/0x2bd0 kernel/exit.c:845\n    do_group_exit+0x108/0x2c8 kernel/exit.c:922\n    get_signal+0x4e4/0x2a88 kernel/signal.c:2781\n    do_signal arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:882 [inline]\n    do_notify_resume+0x300/0x970 arch/arm64/kernel/signal.c:936\n    work_pending+0xc/0x2dc\n\n   Allocated by task 0:\n    slab_post_alloc_hook+0x50/0x5c0 mm/slab.h:516\n    slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:2907 [inline]\n    slab_alloc mm/slub.c:2915 [inline]\n    kmem_cache_alloc+0x1f4/0x4c0 mm/slub.c:2920\n    alloc_pid+0xdc/0xc00 kernel/pid.c:180\n    copy_process+0x2794/0x5e18 kernel/fork.c:2129\n    kernel_clone+0x194/0x13c8 kernel/fork.c:2500\n    kernel_thread+0xd4/0x110 kernel/fork.c:2552\n    rest_init+0x44/0x4a0 init/main.c:687\n    arch_call_rest_init+0x1c/0x28\n    start_kernel+0x520/0x554 init/main.c:1064\n    0x0\n\n   Freed by task 270:\n    slab_free_hook mm/slub.c:1562 [inline]\n    slab_free_freelist_hook+0x98/0x260 mm/slub.c:1600\n    slab_free mm/slub.c:3161 [inline]\n    kmem_cache_free+0x224/0x8e0 mm/slub.c:3177\n    put_pid.part.4+0xe0/0x1a8 kernel/pid.c:114\n    put_pid+0x30/0x48 kernel/pid.c:109\n    proc_do_cad_pid+0x190/0x1b0 kernel/sysctl.c:1401\n    proc_sys_call_handler+0x338/0x4b0 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:591\n    proc_sys_write+0x34/0x48 fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c:617\n    call_write_iter include/linux/fs.h:1977 [inline]\n    new_sync_write+0x3ac/0x510 fs/read_write.c:518\n    vfs_write fs/read_write.c:605 [inline]\n    vfs_write+0x9c4/0x1018 fs/read_write.c:585\n    ksys_write+0x124/0x240 fs/read_write.c:658\n    __do_sys_write fs/read_write.c:670 [inline]\n    __se_sys_write fs/read_write.c:667 [inline]\n    __arm64_sys_write+0x78/0xb0 fs/read_write.c:667\n    __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:37 [inline]\n    invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49 [inline]\n    el0_svc_common.constprop.1+0x16c/0x388 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:129\n    do_el0_svc+0xf8/0x150 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:168\n    el0_svc+0x28/0x38 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:416\n    el0_sync_handler+0x134/0x180 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:432\n    el0_sync+0x154/0x180 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:701\n\n   The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff23794dda0000\n    which belongs to the cache pid of size 224\n   The buggy address is located 4 bytes inside of\n    224-byte region [ff\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up\n\nWhen a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is\ncalled to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the\nsocket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now\ndeallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,\nand the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will\nlead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.\n\nThis commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its\nnormal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the\nconnection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.\n\nOn the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX\nside already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving\nnon-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is\nto block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving\nnon-decrypted packets.\n\nThe necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:\nfirst the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released\n(it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).\n\nA new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback\nmode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes\nuseless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,\nwhich is allocated and freed by the driver).",

This means that the kernel\nbuffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP.\nvalidate_user_xstate_header() can detect some of that corruption, but that\nleaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.\n\nPrior to XSAVES support, it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer,\ncompletely, but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the\nbuffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but\nnot corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.\n\nAvoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy_user_to_xstate()\nwhich validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states\nto the kernel. copy_user_to_xstate() was previously only called for\ncompacted-format kernel buffers, but it works for both compacted and\nnon-compacted forms.\n\nUsing it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple\n__copy_from_user() operations, but that cost is less important than robust\ncode in an already slow path.\n\n[ Changelog polished by Dave Hansen ]",

This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be\nissued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.\n\nAfter applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the\nmentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3.",

SMM has\nan entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can find\na memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).\n\n  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\n  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]\n  CPU: 1 PID: 8410 Comm: syz-executor382 Not tainted 5.13.0-rc5-syzkaller #0\n  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011\n  RIP: 0010:__gfn_to_rmap arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:935 [inline]\n  RIP: 0010:gfn_to_rmap+0x2b0/0x4d0 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:947\n  Code: \u003c42\u003e 80 3c 20 00 74 08 4c 89 ff e8 f1 79 a9 00 4c 89 fb 4d 8b 37 44\n  RSP: 0018:ffffc90000ffef98 EFLAGS: 00010246\n  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff888015b9f414 RCX: ffff888019669c40\n  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: 0000000000000001\n  RBP: 0000000000000001 R08: ffffffff811d9cdb R09: ffffed10065a6002\n  R10: ffffed10065a6002 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: dffffc0000000000\n  R13: 0000000000000003 R14: 0000000000000001 R15: 0000000000000000\n  FS:  000000000124b300(0000) GS:ffff8880b9b00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000028e31000 CR4: 00000000001526e0\n  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  Call Trace:\n   rmap_add arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:965 [inline]\n   mmu_set_spte+0x862/0xe60 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2604\n   __direct_map arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2862 [inline]\n   direct_page_fault+0x1f74/0x2b70 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:3769\n   kvm_mmu_do_page_fault arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h:124 [inline]\n   kvm_mmu_page_fault+0x199/0x1440 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:5065\n   vmx_handle_exit+0x26/0x160 arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:6122\n   vcpu_enter_guest+0x3bdd/0x9630 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9428\n   vcpu_run+0x416/0xc20 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9494\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x4e8/0xa40 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9722\n   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x70f/0xbb0 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:3460\n   vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n   __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:1069 [inline]\n   __se_sys_ioctl+0xfb/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:1055\n   do_syscall_64+0x3f/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:47\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n  RIP: 0033:0x440ce9",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: ngene: Fix out-of-bounds bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf()\n\nFix an 11-year old bug in ngene_command_config_free_buf() while\naddressing the following warnings caught with -Warray-bounds:\n\narch/alpha/include/asm/string.h:22:16: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]\narch/x86/include/asm/string_32.h:182:25: warning: '__builtin_memcpy' offset [12, 16] from the object at 'com' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'config' with type 'unsigned char' at offset 10 [-Warray-bounds]\n\nThe problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of\ndata into a one-byte size member _config_ of the wrong structue\nFW_CONFIGURE_BUFFERS, in a single call to memcpy(). This causes a\nlegitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length\nof \u0026com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config. It seems that the right\nstructure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains\n6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of\nthe function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual\nintention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers\n(which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).\n\nFix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS\ninto new struct config, and use \u0026com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as\nthe destination address, instead of \u0026com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,\nwhen calling memcpy().\n\nThis also helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable\n-Warray-bounds and get us closer to being able to tighten the\nFORTIFY_SOURCE routines on memcpy().",

However, in the unlikely\ncase that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost-\u003eehandler is set\nto ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).\n\nThe error handler cleanup code in scsi_host_dev_release() will call\nkthread_stop() if shost-\u003eehandler != NULL which will always be the case\nwhether the kthread was successfully spawned or not.

But later on\ncommit d3ca587404b3 (\"powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute\nfaults\") removed that handling, introducing test based on error_code.\nAnd here is the problem, because on the 603 all upper bits of SRR1\nget cleared when the TLB instruction miss handler bails out to ISI.\n\nUntil commit cbd7e6ca0210 (\"powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy\nsearch_exception_tables() verification\"), an exec fault from kernel\nat a userspace address was indirectly caught by the lack of entry for\nthat address in the exception tables. But after that commit the\nkernel mainly relies on KUAP or on core mm handling to catch wrong\nuser accesses. Here the access is not wrong, so mm handles it.\nIt is a minor fault because PAGE_EXEC is not set,\nset_access_flags_filter() should set PAGE_EXEC and voila.\nBut as is_exec_fault() returns false as explained in the beginning,\nset_access_flags_filter() bails out without setting PAGE_EXEC flag,\nwhich leads to a forever minor exec fault.\n\nAs the kernel is not prepared to handle such exec faults, the thing to\ndo is to fire in bad_kernel_fault() for any exec fault taken by the\nkernel, as it was prior to commit d3ca587404b3.",

All the control bits like command stop,\nabort are located at [0:3] bits. While aborting a command, we read the\nCRCR and set the abort bit and write to the CRCR. The read will always\ngive command ring pointer as all zeros. So we essentially write only\nthe control bits. Since we split the 64 bit write into two 32 bit writes,\nthere is a possibility of xHC command ring stopped before the upper\ndword (all zeros) is written. If that happens, xHC updates the upper\ndword of its internal command ring pointer with all zeros. Next time,\nwhen the command ring is restarted, we see xHC memory access failures.\nFix this issue by only writing to the lower dword of CRCR where all\ncontrol bits are located.",

With this\nkernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time\ndsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to\nerror out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on\nthe Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the\nsystem is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the\nboot phase triggers the crash.\n\nMy limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit\nwhich was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,\ndoes not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to\nfire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot\never happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the\n-\u003eenable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform\ndevice must be already registered in order for the core or any other\nuser to use this callback.\n\nHence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent future\nerrors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones.",

So, this commit fixes the panic by initializing\ntimer-\u003etimer_type using kzalloc instead of kmalloc.\n\nTest commands:\n    # iptables -A OUTPUT -j IDLETIMER --timeout 1 --label test\n    $ cat /sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/test\n      Killed\n\nSplat looks like:\n    BUG: KASAN: user-memory-access in alarm_expires_remaining+0x49/0x70\n    Read of size 8 at addr 0000002e8c7bc4c8 by task cat/917\n    CPU: 12 PID: 917 Comm: cat Not tainted 5.14.0+ #3 79940a339f71eb14fc81aee1757a20d5bf13eb0e\n    Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014\n    Call Trace:\n     dump_stack_lvl+0x6e/0x9c\n     kasan_report.cold+0x112/0x117\n     ? alarm_expires_remaining+0x49/0x70\n     __asan_load8+0x86/0xb0\n     alarm_expires_remaining+0x49/0x70\n     idletimer_tg_show+0xe5/0x19b [xt_IDLETIMER 11219304af9316a21bee5ba9d58f76a6b9bccc6d]\n     dev_attr_show+0x3c/0x60\n     sysfs_kf_seq_show+0x11d/0x1f0\n     ? device_remove_bin_file+0x20/0x20\n     kernfs_seq_show+0xa4/0xb0\n     seq_read_iter+0x29c/0x750\n     kernfs_fop_read_iter+0x25a/0x2c0\n     ? __fsnotify_parent+0x3d1/0x570\n     ? iov_iter_init+0x70/0x90\n     new_sync_read+0x2a7/0x3d0\n     ? __x64_sys_llseek+0x230/0x230\n     ? rw_verify_area+0x81/0x150\n     vfs_read+0x17b/0x240\n     ksys_read+0xd9/0x180\n     ? vfs_write+0x460/0x460\n     ? do_syscall_64+0x16/0xc0\n     ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x79/0x120\n     __x64_sys_read+0x43/0x50\n     do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n    RIP: 0033:0x7f0cdc819142\n    Code: c0 e9 c2 fe ff ff 50 48 8d 3d 3a ca 0a 00 e8 f5 19 02 00 0f 1f 44 00 00 f3 0f 1e fa 64 8b 04 25 18 00 00 00 85 c0 75 10 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 56 c3 0f 1f 44 00 00 48 83 ec 28 48 89 54 24\n    RSP: 002b:00007fff28eee5b8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000000\n    RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000020000 RCX: 00007f0cdc819142\n    RDX: 0000000000020000 RSI: 00007f0cdc032000 RDI: 0000000000000003\n    RBP: 00007f0cdc032000 R08: 00007f0cdc031010 R09: 0000000000000000\n    R10: 0000000000000022 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00005607e9ee31f0\n    R13: 0000000000000003 R14: 0000000000020000 R15: 0000000000020000",

However these pages are\nbeyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages\nand no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.\n\nThis oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a (\"ocfs2: No need to zero\npages past i_size.\") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion\npath was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why\nthe zeroing actually is not needed.\n\nAfter commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped\ninvalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up\nwith clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being\nstill dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then\nwriteback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages\nbecome valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,\nmark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already\ndirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.  So data\nwritten to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.\n\nSimple reproducer for the problem is:\n\n  xfs_io -f -c \"pwrite 0 2000\" -c \"pwrite 2000 2000\" -c \"fsync\" \\\n    -c \"pwrite 4000 2000\" ocfs2_file\n\nAfter unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of\n'ocfs2_file' has lost its contents.\n\nFix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion\nfrom inline format similarly as in the standard write path.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix whitespace, per Joseph]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle_kvm_start_guest()\n\nIn commit 10d91611f426 (\"powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in\nC\") kvm_start_guest() became idle_kvm_start_guest(). The old code\nallocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the\nframe to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's\nframe.\n\nidle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C\nfunction, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its\ncallers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller\nframe on the emergency stack.\n\nThe emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:\n\n  paca_ptrs[i]-\u003eemergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;\n\nSo emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency\nstack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without\nfirst decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the\nregular kernel stack, paca-\u003ekstack, which is initialised to point at an\ninitial frame that is ready to use.\n\nidle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which\nwrite outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a\nstack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the\nframe it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so\nthe saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the\nemergency stack allocation.\n\nThe end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248\nbytes above the emergency stack allocation.\n\nIn practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above\nthe emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,\neither another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of\ncalls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().\n\nThe low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are\nonly used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially\nnever happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd\ncrash due to that stack overflowing.\n\nStill, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely\nluck that we aren't corrupting something else.\n\nTo fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on\nentry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space for\npt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the\nexisting stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the\nemergency stack.",

      "Description": "Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has been exploited.\n\nMemory is allocated prior to the checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make dynamic zone changes.\n\nIf a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to achieve the same detrimental outcome.\n\nBIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.",

This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction.

Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.",

While not exposed to the affected guests themselves, the interface specifically exists for domains controlling such guests. This interface may therefore be used by not fully privileged entities, e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or qemu running in a so called stub-domain.

In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()\nwill return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer\nto a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer\nthen a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This\ncould be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM\nfiles for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.\n\nThe functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around\nPEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.\n\nThese functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL\nfunctions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and\nSSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal\nuses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the\nheader argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations\ninclude the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in\nOpenSSL 3.0.\n\nThe OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix hang in usb_kill_urb by adding memory barriers\n\nThe syzbot fuzzer has identified a bug in which processes hang waiting\nfor usb_kill_urb() to return.  It turns out the issue is not unlinking\nthe URB; that works just fine.  Rather, the problem arises when the\nwakeup notification that the URB has completed is not received.\n\nThe reason is memory-access ordering on SMP systems.  In outline form,\nusb_kill_urb() and __usb_hcd_giveback_urb() operating concurrently on\ndifferent CPUs perform the following actions:\n\nCPU 0\t\t\t\t\tCPU 1\n----------------------------\t\t---------------------------------\nusb_kill_urb():\t\t\t\t__usb_hcd_giveback_urb():\n  ...\t\t\t\t\t  ...\n  atomic_inc(\u0026urb-\u003ereject);\t\t  atomic_dec(\u0026urb-\u003euse_count);\n  ...\t\t\t\t\t  ...\n  wait_event(usb_kill_urb_queue,\n\tatomic_read(\u0026urb-\u003euse_count) == 0);\n\t\t\t\t\t  if (atomic_read(\u0026urb-\u003ereject))\n\t\t\t\t\t\twake_up(\u0026usb_kill_urb_queue);\n\nConfining your attention to urb-\u003ereject and urb-\u003euse_count, you can\nsee that the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 0 is:\n\n\twrite urb-\u003ereject, then read urb-\u003euse_count;\n\nwhereas the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 1 is:\n\n\twrite urb-\u003euse_count, then read urb-\u003ereject.\n\nThis pattern is referred to in memory-model circles as SB (for \"Store\nBuffering\"), and it is well known that without suitable enforcement of\nthe desired order of accesses -- in the form of memory barriers -- it\nis entirely possible for one or both CPUs to execute their reads ahead\nof their writes.  The end result will be that sometimes CPU 0 sees the\nold un-decremented value of urb-\u003euse_count while CPU 1 sees the old\nun-incremented value of urb-\u003ereject.  Consequently CPU 0 ends up on\nthe wait queue and never gets woken up, leading to the observed hang\nin usb_kill_urb().\n\nThe same pattern of accesses occurs in usb_poison_urb() and the\nfailure pathway of usb_hcd_submit_urb().\n\nThe problem is fixed by adding suitable memory barriers.  To provide\nproper memory-access ordering in the SB pattern, a full barrier is\nrequired on both CPUs.  The atomic_inc() and atomic_dec() accesses\nthemselves don't provide any memory ordering, but since they are\npresent, we can use the optimized smp_mb__after_atomic() memory\nbarrier in the various routines to obtain the desired effect.\n\nThis patch adds the necessary memory barriers.",

We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.",

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.",

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container's outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.",

This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.\n\nVersion 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.",

The `auth_start_session` function can return non-zero (1) value on, e.g., PAM error which may result in in session restrictions such as max concurrent sessions per user by PAM (ex ./etc/security/limits.conf) to be bypassed. Users (administrators) don't use restrictions by PAM are not affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.9.23. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the \"rpcecho\" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the \"rpcecho\" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a \"sleep()\" call in the \"dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()\" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the \"rpcecho\" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as \"rpcecho\" runs in the main RPC task.",

This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

      "Description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.",

      "Description": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nIB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests\n\nhfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data\ncorruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs\nwhere an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page\nboundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a\n\nHere are the specific bugs:\n1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec-\u003eiov.iov_len.\n   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec\n   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past\n   iovec-\u003eiov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.\n2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the\n   next iovec in user_sdma_request-\u003eiovs when the current iovec\n   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the\n   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the\n   iovec pages.\n\nThis has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2\nbecause they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail\niovec of an SDMA request.\n\nFixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache\n(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests\nwith multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So\nthis commit fixes those issues as well.\n\nHere are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec\npayload user SDMA requests can hit:\n1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate\n   pinnings.\n2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),\n   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)\n   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock\n   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.\n\n   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)\n   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.\n\n   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the\n   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between\n   (2) and (3).\n3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount is\n   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler-\u003elock. As a result, mmu_rb_node\n   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler-\u003elock and\n   checks mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount before mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount is\n   incremented.\n4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not\n   check mmu_rb_node-\u003erefcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.\n\n   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have\n   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the\n   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests\n   complete.",

Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   \u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---",

While this would be fixable by somehow\nmaking cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would require\nsizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be more\njustifiable if we identify more cases like this.\n\n  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x60/0xc0\n  Write of size 4 at addr ffff88810e625328 by task a.out/4404\n\n\tCPU: 19 PID: 4404 Comm: a.out Not tainted 6.2.0-rc6 #38\n\tHardware name: Amazon EC2 c5a.8xlarge/, BIOS 1.0 10/16/2017\n\tCall Trace:\n\t\u003cTASK\u003e\n\tdump_stack_lvl+0x73/0xa0\n\tprint_report+0x16c/0x4e0\n\tkasan_report+0xc3/0xf0\n\tkasan_check_range+0x2d2/0x310\n\t_raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x60/0xc0\n\tremove_wait_queue+0x1a/0xa0\n\tep_free+0x12c/0x170\n\tep_eventpoll_release+0x26/0x30\n\t__fput+0x202/0x400\n\ttask_work_run+0x11d/0x170\n\tdo_exit+0x495/0x1130\n\tdo_group_exit+0x100/0x100\n\tget_signal+0xd67/0xde0\n\tarch_do_signal_or_restart+0x2a/0x2b0\n\texit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x94/0x100\n\tsyscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x20/0x40\n\tdo_syscall_64+0x52/0x90\n\tentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\t\u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n Allocated by task 4404:\n\n\tkasan_set_track+0x3d/0x60\n\t__kasan_kmalloc+0x85/0x90\n\tpsi_trigger_create+0x113/0x3e0\n\tpressure_write+0x146/0x2e0\n\tcgroup_file_write+0x11c/0x250\n\tkernfs_fop_write_iter+0x186/0x220\n\tvfs_write+0x3d8/0x5c0\n\tksys_write+0x90/0x110\n\tdo_syscall_64+0x43/0x90\n\tentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\n Freed by task 4407:\n\n\tkasan_set_track+0x3d/0x60\n\tkasan_save_free_info+0x27/0x40\n\t____kasan_slab_free+0x11d/0x170\n\tslab_free_freelist_hook+0x87/0x150\n\t__kmem_cache_free+0xcb/0x180\n\tpsi_trigger_destroy+0x2e8/0x310\n\tcgroup_file_release+0x4f/0xb0\n\tkernfs_drain_open_files+0x165/0x1f0\n\tkernfs_drain+0x162/0x1a0\n\t__kernfs_remove+0x1fb/0x310\n\tkernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0x95/0xe0\n\tcgroup_addrm_files+0x67f/0x700\n\tcgroup_destroy_locked+0x283/0x3c0\n\tcgroup_rmdir+0x29/0x100\n\tkernfs_iop_rmdir+0xd1/0x140\n\tvfs_rmdir+0xfe/0x240\n\tdo_rmdir+0x13d/0x280\n\t__x64_sys_rmdir+0x2c/0x30\n\tdo_syscall_64+0x43/0x90\n\tentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent\n\nThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan\nand Christian Rossow.\n\nACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:\n\n   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if\n   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c=\n   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\n   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\n   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\n   duplicate (SEG.ACK \u003c SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK\n   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK \u003e SND.NXT) then send an\n   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that\n   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means\n   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the\n   ACK check more stringent since any ACK \u003c SND.UNA wouldn't be\n   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -\n   MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c= SND.NXT) get through.\n\nThis can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,\nby not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.\n\nThis greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.\n\nI added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,\neven if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.\n\ntp-\u003ebytes_acked was added in linux-4.2\n\nFollowing packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows\nthe issue at hand:\n\n0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3\n+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0\n+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0\n+0 listen(3, 1024) = 0\n\n// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //\n\n// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to\n// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.

Quoting Eric:\n  Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(),\n  which is buggy because output path relies on sk not disappearing.\n\n  A relevant old patch about the issue was :\n  8282f27449bf (\"inet: frag: Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()\")\n\n  [..]\n\n  net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb-\u003esk being set, and probably to an\n  inet socket, not an arbitrary one.\n\n  If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ\n  packet scheduler will not work properly.\n\n  We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really\n  needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used.\n\nEric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch.\nHowever there is a problem with this:\n\nIf skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copy\nhead-\u003esk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree.\nIOW, we have no choice but to fix up sk_wmem accouting to reflect the\nfully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow.\n\nThis change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment.\nAs ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff-\u003esk member, we must move the\noffset into the FRAG_CB, else skb-\u003esk gets clobbered.\n\nThis allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb has\nto be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue.\n\nIn the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned.  This is\nsafe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine.\n\nIn the latter case, we will steal the skb-\u003esk reference, reattach it to\nthe head skb, and fix up wmem accouting when inet_frag inflates truesize.",

In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution. Commit ff1f8a623e090dee8a8aadf12a6a4b25efac143d contains a patch for the issue.",

There is a scenario where the\nFFS application issues an AIO cancel call, while the UDC is handling a\nsoft disconnect.  For a DWC3 based implementation, the callstack looks\nlike the following:\n\n    DWC3 Gadget                               FFS Application\ndwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()              ...\n  --\u003e dwc3_stop_active_transfers()\n    --\u003e dwc3_gadget_giveback(-ESHUTDOWN)\n      --\u003e ffs_epfile_async_io_complete()   ffs_aio_cancel()\n        --\u003e usb_ep_free_request()            --\u003e usb_ep_dequeue()\n\nThere is currently no locking implemented between the AIO completion\nhandler and AIO cancel, so the issue occurs if the completion routine is\nrunning in parallel to an AIO cancel call coming from the FFS application.\nAs the completion call frees the USB request (io_data-\u003ereq) the FFS\napplication is also referencing it for the usb_ep_dequeue() call.  This can\nlead to accessing a stale/hanging pointer.\n\ncommit b566d38857fc (\"usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data-\u003estatus consistently\")\nrelocated the usb_ep_free_request() into ffs_epfile_async_io_complete().\nHowever, in order to properly implement locking to mitigate this issue, the\nspinlock can't be added to ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(), as\nusb_ep_dequeue() (if successfully dequeuing a USB request) will call the\nfunction driver's completion handler in the same context.  Hence, leading\ninto a deadlock.\n\nFix this issue by moving the usb_ep_free_request() back to\nffs_user_copy_worker(), and ensuring that it explicitly sets io_data-\u003ereq\nto NULL after freeing it within the ffs-\u003eeps_lock.  This resolves the race\ncondition above, as the ffs_aio_cancel() routine will not continue\nattempting to dequeue a request that has already been freed, or the\nffs_user_copy_work() not freeing the USB request until the AIO cancel is\ndone referencing it.\n\nThis fix depends on\n  commit b566d38857fc (\"usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data-\u003estatus\n  consistently\")",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-37891",
      "Description": " urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.",

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.",

      "Description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause\nmemory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations\n\nImpact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such\nas the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.\nHowever, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are\naffected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",
