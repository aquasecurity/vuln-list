      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp5-chost-byos-v20240809-arm64 contains the following changes:\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Upgrade to release 9.16.50  Bug Fixes:\n  * A regression in cache-cleaning code enabled memory use to grow\n    significantly more quickly than before, until the configured\n    max-cache-size limit was reached. This has been fixed.\n  * Using rndc flush inadvertently caused cache cleaning to become\n    less effective. This could ultimately lead to the configured\n    max-cache-size limit being exceeded and has now been fixed.\n  * The logic for cleaning up expired cached DNS records was\n    tweaked to be more aggressive. This change helps with enforcing\n    max-cache-ttl and max-ncache-ttl in a timely manner.\n  * It was possible to trigger a use-after-free assertion when the\n    overmem cache cleaning was initiated. This has been fixed.\n  New Features:\n  * Added RESOLVER.ARPA to the built in empty zones.\n- Security Fixes:\n  * It is possible to craft excessively large numbers of resource\n    record types for a given owner name, which has the effect of\n    slowing down database processing. This has been addressed by\n    adding a configurable limit to the number of records that can\n    be stored per name and type in a cache or zone database. The\n    default is 100, which can be tuned with the new\n    max-types-per-name option. (CVE-2024-1737)\n    [bsc#1228256, bind-9.16-CVE-2024-1737.patch]\n  * Validating DNS messages signed using the SIG(0) protocol (RFC\n    2931) could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a\n    denial-of-service condition. Support for SIG(0) message\n    validation was removed from this version of named.\n    (CVE-2024-1975)\n    [bsc#1228257, bind-9.16-CVE-2024-1975.patch]\n  * When looking up the NS records of parent zones as part of\n    looking up DS records, it was possible for named to trigger an\n    assertion failure if serve-stale was enabled. This has been\n    fixed. (CVE-2024-4076)\n    [bsc#1228258, bind-9.16-CVE-2024-4076.patch]\n\nPackage docker was updated:\n\n[NOTE: This update was only ever released in SLES and Leap.]- Update to Docker 25.0.6-ce.

      "Description": " urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.",

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.",
