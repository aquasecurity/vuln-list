      "Text": "\nThe SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP1 RT kernel was updated to receive various security and bugfixes.\n\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-12126 CVE-2018-12127 CVE-2018-12130: Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS): Stored buffers on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution which may have allowed an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. A list of impacted products can be found here: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/corporate-information/SA00233-microcode-update-guidance_05132019. (bsc#1103186)\n- CVE-2019-11091: Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM): Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may have allowed an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. A list of impacted products can be found here: https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/corporate-information/SA00233-microcode-update-guidance_05132019. (bsc#1111331)\n- CVE-2019-12382: An issue was discovered in drm_load_edid_firmware in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c in the Linux kernel There was an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). (bsc#1136586)\n- CVE-2019-10124: An issue was discovered in the hwpoison implementation in mm/memory-failure.c in the Linux kernel. When soft_offline_in_use_page() runs on a thp tail page after pmd is split, an attacker could cause a denial of service (bsc#1130699).\n- CVE-2019-11486: The Siemens R3964 line discipline driver in drivers/tty/n_r3964.c in the Linux kernel has multiple race conditions. (bsc#1133188)\n- CVE-2019-11811: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel There was a use-after-free upon attempted read access to /proc/ioports after the ipmi_si module was removed, related to drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c, drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_mem_io.c, and drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_port_io.c. (bsc#1134397)\n- CVE-2019-11487: The Linux kernel allowed page reference count overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c, include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c.  It could occur with FUSE requests. (bsc#1133190)\n- CVE-2019-12818: The nfc_llcp_build_tlv function in net/nfc/llcp_commands.c may return NULL. If the caller does not check for this, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This will cause denial of service. This used to affect nfc_llcp_build_gb in net/nfc/llcp_core.c. (bsc#1138293)\n- CVE-2019-11833: fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel did not zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem. (bsc#1135281)\n- CVE-2019-5489: The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server. (bsc#1120843)\n- CVE-2018-7191: In the tun subsystem in the Linux kernel, dev_get_valid_name was not called before register_netdevice. This allowed local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via an ioctl(TUNSETIFF) call with a dev name containing a / character. (bsc#1135603)\n- CVE-2019-11884: The do_hidp_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/hidp/sock.c in the Linux kernel allowed a local user to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a hidPCONNADD command, because a name field may not end with a '\\0' character. (bsc#1134848)\n- CVE-2019-9500: An issue was discovered that lead to brcmfmac heap buffer overflow. (bsc#1132681)\n- CVE-2019-11085: Insufficient input validation in Kernel Mode Driver in Intel(R) i915 Graphics for Linux may have allowed an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. (bsc#1135278)\n- CVE-2019-11815: An issue was discovered in rds_tcp_kill_sock in net/rds/tcp.c in the Linux kernel There was a race condition leading to a use-after-free, related to net namespace cleanup. (bsc#1135278)\n- CVE-2018-16880: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the [vhost_net] driver. A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, could trigger an out-of-bounds write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may have lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (bsc#1122767)\n- CVE-2019-12819: The function __mdiobus_register() called put_device(), which triggered a fixed_mdio_bus_init use-after-free. This would cause a denial of service. (bsc#1138291)\n- CVE-2019-3882: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permitted violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device was bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may have caused a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). (bsc#1131427)\n- CVE-2019-3846: A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module while connecting to a malicious wireless network. (bsc#1136424)\n- CVE-2019-8564: An issue was discoved which meant that brcmfmac frame validation could be bypassed. (bsc#1132673)\n- CVE-2019-9503: An issue was discoved which meant that brcmfmac frame validation could be bypassed. (bsc#1132828)\n- CVE-2019-9003: In the Linux kernel, attackers could trigger a drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c use-after-free and OOPS by arranging for certain simultaneous execution of the code, as demonstrated by a 'service ipmievd restart' loop. (bsc#1126704)\n- CVE-2017-5753: Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and branch prediction may have allowed unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.\n- CVE-2019-11478: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs which will fragment the TCP retransmission queue. An attacker may have been able to further exploit the fragmented queue to cause an expensive linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP connection.\n- CVE-2019-11479: An attacker could force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments. This would drastically increased the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. Further, it would consume additional resources such as CPU and NIC processing power.\n- CVE-2018-16871: A NULL pointer dereference due to an anomalized NFS message sequence was fixed. (bnc#1137103).\n- CVE-2019-12614: An issue was discovered in dlpar_parse_cc_property in arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c. There was an unchecked kstrdup of prop-\u003ename, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) (bnc#1137194).\n- CVE-2019-12817: On the PowerPC architecture, local attackers could access other users processes memory (bnc#1138263).\n- CVE-2018-20836: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel There was a race condition in smp_task_timedout() and smp_task_done() in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c, leading to a use-after-free (bnc#1134395).\n- CVE-2019-10638: In the Linux kernel, a device could be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic was sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it was possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack may have been conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses (bnc#1140575 1140577).\n- CVE-2019-10639: The Linux kernel allowed Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it was possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic was sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it was possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key was extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image was exposed. This attack could be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace (bnc#1140577).\n- CVE-2019-11599: The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel did not use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it ran, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c, fs/proc/task_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_main.c (bnc#1131645 1133738).\n- CVE-2019-13233: In arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c in the Linux kernel, there was a use-after-free for access to an LDT entry because of a race condition between modify_ldt() and a #BR exception for an MPX bounds violation (bnc#1140454).\n- CVE-2018-20855: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel In create_qp_common in drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/qp.c, mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp was never initialized, resulting in a leak of stack memory to userspace(bsc#1143045).\n- CVE-2019-1125: Exclude ATOMs from speculation through SWAPGS (bsc#1139358).\n- CVE-2019-11810: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel A NULL pointer dereference could occur when megasas_create_frame_pool() failed in megasas_alloc_cmds() in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c. This caused a Denial of Service, related to a use-after-free (bnc#1134399).\n- CVE-2019-13631: In parse_hid_report_descriptor in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in the Linux kernel, a malicious USB device could send an HID report that triggered an out-of-bounds write during generation of debugging messages. (bnc#1142023)\n- CVE-2019-13648: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, when hardware transactional memory was disabled, a local user could cause a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and system crash) via a sigreturn() system call that sent a crafted signal frame. (bnc#1142254)\n- CVE-2019-14283: In the Linux kernel, set_geometry in drivers/block/floppy.c did not validate the sect and head fields, as demonstrated by an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read. It could be triggered by an unprivileged local user when a floppy disk was inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default. (bnc#1143191)\n- CVE-2019-14284: In the Linux kernel, drivers/block/floppy.c allows a denial of service by setup_format_params division-by-zero. (bnc#1143189)\n- CVE-2019-12456: An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in _ctl_ioctl_main in drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c in the Linux. It allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing the value of ioc_number between two kernel reads of that value, aka a 'double fetch' vulnerability. NOTE: a third party reports that this is unexploitable because the doubly fetched value is not used. (bsc#1136922)\n- CVE-2019-12380: An issue was discovered in the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel phys_efi_set_virtual_address_map in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi_call_phys_prolog in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures.

      "Description": "The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.",
