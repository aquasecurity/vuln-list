      "Text": "\n  \nThis is a version update for podman to version 1.4.4 (bsc#1143386).\n\nAdditional changes by SUSE on top:\n\n- Remove fuse-overlayfs because it's (currently) an unsatisfied dependency on\n  SLE (bsc#1143386)\n- Update libpod.conf to use correct infra_command\n- Update libpod.conf to use better versioned pause container\n- Update libpod.conf to use official kubic pause container\n- Update libpod.conf to match latest features set:\n  detach_keys, lock_type, runtime_supports_json\n- Add podman-remote varlink client\n\nVersion update podman to v1.4.4:\n\n- Features\n\n  - Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using multiple OCI\n    runtimes. Containers now remember if they were created with a different\n    runtime using --runtime and will always use that runtime\n  - The cached and delegated options for volume mounts are now allowed for\n    Docker compatability (#3340)\n  - The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag\n\n- Bugfixes\n\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the entire root\n    configuration if no rootless configuration was present for the user,\n    breaking rootless Podman for new installations\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block SIGTERM,\n    preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until the system's init\n    send SIGKILL\n  - Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not work after\n    running rootless Podman at least once\n  - Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the --tmpfs flag\n    were being ignored\n  - Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be displayed\n    and removed by Podman\n  - Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to create a\n    container or pod\n  - Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a directory at\n    the target and place the file in it (#3384)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman inspect --format '{{.Mounts}}' would print a\n    hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add an entry to container's\n    /etc/hosts files for their own hostname (#3405)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman ps --sync would segfault (#3411)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman generate kube would produce an invalid ports\n    configuration (#3408)\n\n- Misc\n\n  - Updated containers/storage to v1.12.13\n  - Podman now performs much better on systems with heavy I/O load\n  - The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct default setting\n    in help if the default was overridden by libpod.conf\n  - For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in podman run\n    is now supported as an alias for --log-driver=k8s-file. This is considered\n    deprecated, and json-file will be moved to a new implementation in the\n    future ([#3363](https://github.com/containers/libpo\\\n    d/issues/3363))\n  - Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI runtime to be\n    used if it is installed\n\nUpdate podman to v1.4.2:\n\n- Fixed a bug where Podman could not run containers using an older version of\n  Systemd as init\n- Updated vendored Buildah to v1.9.0 to resolve a critical bug with\n  Dockerfile RUN instructions\n- The error message for running podman kill on containers that are not\n  running has been improved\n- Podman remote client can now log to a file if syslog is not available\n- The podman exec command now sets its error code differently based on\n  whether the container does not exist, and the command in the container does\n  not exist\n- The podman inspect command on containers now outputs Mounts JSON that matches\n  that of docker inspect, only including user-specified volumes and\n  differentiating bind mounts and named volumes\n- The podman inspect command now reports the path to a container's OCI spec\n  with the OCIConfigPath key (only included when the container is initialized\n  or running)\n- The podman run --mount command now supports the bind-nonrecursive option for\n  bind mounts\n- Fixed a bug where podman play kube would fail to create containers due to an\n  unspecified log driver\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to build with musl libc\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using slirp4netns networking in an\n  environment with no nameservers on the host other than localhost would\n  result in nonfunctional networking\n- Fixed a bug where podman import would not properly set environment\n  variables, discarding their values and retaining only keys\n- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run when built with Apparmor support\n  but run on systems without the Apparmor kernel module loaded\n- Remote Podman will now default the username it uses to log in to remote\n  systems to the username of the current user\n- Podman now uses JSON logging with OCI runtimes that support it, allowing for\n  better error reporting\n- Updated vendored containers/image to v2.0\n- Update conmon to v0.3.0\n- Support OOM Monitor under cgroup V2\n- Add config binary and make target for configuring conmon with a go library\n  for importing values\n\nUpdated podman to version 1.4.0 (bsc#1137860) and (bsc#1135460) \n\n- Podman checkpoint and podman restore commands can now be\n  used to migrate containers between Podman installations on\n  different systems.\n- The podman cp now supports pause flag.\n- The remote client now supports a configuration file for\n  pre-configuring connections to remote Podman installations\n- CVE-2019-10152: Fixed an iproper dereference of symlinks of the\n  the podman cp command which introduced in version 1.1.0 (bsc#1136974).\n- Fixed a bug where podman commit could improperly set environment variables \n  that contained = characters\n- Fixed a bug where rootless podman would sometimes fail to start\n  containers with forwarded ports\n- Fixed a bug where podman version on the remote client could\n  segfault\n- Fixed a bug where podman container runlabel would use /proc/self/exe instead of \n  the path of the Podman command when printing the command being executed\n- Fixed a bug where filtering images by label did not work\n- Fixed a bug where specifying a bing mount or tmpfs mount over\n  an image volume would cause a container to be unable to start\n- Fixed a bug where podman generate kube did not work with\n  containers with named volumes\n- Fixed a bug where rootless podman would receive permission\n  denied errors accessing conmon.pid\n- Fixed a bug where podman cp with a folder specified as target\n  would replace the folder, as opposed to copying into it\n- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman commands could double-unlock\n  a lock, causing a crash\n- Fixed a bug where podman incorrectly set tmpcopyup on /dev/\n  mounts, causing errors when using the Kata containers runtime\n- Fixed a bug where podman exec would fail on older kernels\n- Podman commit command is now usable with the Podman remote client\n- Signature-policy flag has been deprecated\n- Updated vendored containers/storage and containers/image libraries \n  with numerous bugfixes\n- Updated vendored Buildah to v1.8.3\n- Podman now requires Conmon v0.2.0\n- The podman cp command is now aliased as podman container cp\n- Rootless podman will now default init_path using root Podman's\n  configuration files (/etc/containers/libpod.conf and\n  /usr/share/containers/libpod.conf) if not overridden in the\n  rootless configuration\n- Added fuse-overlayfs dependency to support overlay based rootless image\n  manipulations\n- The podman cp command can now read input redirected to STDIN, and output to\n  STDOUT instead of a file, using - instead of an argument.\n- The podman remote client now displays version information from both the\n  client and server in podman version\n- The podman unshare command has been added, allowing easy entry into the\n  user namespace set up by rootless Podman (allowing the removal of files\n  created by rootless podman, among other things)\n- Fixed a bug where Podman containers with the --rm flag were removing\n  created volumes when they were automatically removed\n- Fixed a bug where container and pod locks were incorrectly marked as\n  released after a system reboot, causing errors on container and pod removal\n- Fixed a bug where Podman pods could not be removed if any container in the\n  pod encountered an error during removal\n- Fixed a bug where Podman pods run with the cgroupfs CGroup driver would encounter \n  a race condition during removal, potentially failing to remove the pod CGroup\n- Fixed a bug where the podman container checkpoint and podman container\n  restore commands were not visible in the remote client\n- Fixed a bug where podman remote ps --ns would not print the container's namespaces\n- Fixed a bug where removing stopped containers with healthchecks could cause an error\n- Fixed a bug where the default libpod.conf file was causing parsing errors\n- Fixed a bug where pod locks were not being freed when pods were removed,\n  potentially leading to lock exhaustion\n- Fixed a bug where 'podman run' with SD_NOTIFY set could, on short-running\n  containers, create an inconsistent state rendering the container unusable\n- The remote Podman client now uses the Varlink bridge to establish remote\n  connections by default\n- Fixed an issue with apparmor_parser (bsc#1123387)\n\n- Update to libpod v1.4.0 (bsc#1137860):\n- The podman checkpoint and podman restore commands can now be\n  used to migrate containers between Podman installations on\n  different systems\n- The podman cp command now supports a pause flag to pause\n  containers while copying into them\n- The remote client now supports a configuration file for\n  pre-configuring connections to remote Podman installations\n- Fixed CVE-2019-10152 -
