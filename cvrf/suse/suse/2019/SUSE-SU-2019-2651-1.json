      "Text": "\nThe SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 for Azure kernel was updated to receive various security and bugfixes.\n\n\nThe following security bugs were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-18551: An issue was discovered in drivers/i2c/i2c-core-smbus.c. There was an out of bounds write in the function i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated (bnc#1146163).\n- CVE-2017-18595: A double free may be caused by the function allocate_trace_buffer in the file kernel/trace/trace.c (bnc#1149555).\n- CVE-2018-20976: An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_super.c. A use after free exists, related to xfs_fs_fill_super failure (bnc#1146285).\n- CVE-2018-21008: A use-after-free could have been caused by the function rsi_mac80211_detach in the file drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_mac80211.c (bnc#1149591).\n- CVE-2019-9456: In the Pixel C USB monitor driver there was a possible OOB write due to a missing bounds check. This could have led to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation (bnc#1150025).\n- CVE-2019-9506: The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permitted sufficiently low encryption key length and did not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allowed practical brute-force attacks (aka 'KNOB') that could decrypt traffic and injected arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing (bnc#1137865 bnc#1146042).\n- CVE-2019-14814: There was a heap-based buffer overflow in the Marvell wifi chip driver, that allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code (bnc#1146512).\n- CVE-2019-14814: There was a heap-based buffer overflow in the Marvell wifi chip driver, that allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code (bnc#1146512).\n- CVE-2019-14816: There was a heap-based buffer overflow in the Marvell wifi chip driver, that allowed local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code (bnc#1146516).\n- CVE-2019-14821: An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the coalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm_coalesced_mmio' object, wherein write indices 'ring-\u003efirst' and 'ring-\u003elast' value could be supplied by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system (bnc#1151350).\n- CVE-2019-14835: A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could have used this flaw to increase their privileges on the host (bnc#1150112).\n- CVE-2019-15030: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local user could have read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check (bnc#1149713).\n- CVE-2019-15031: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local user could have read vector registers of other users' processes via an interrupt. To exploit the vulnerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process, because MSR_TM_ACTIVE was misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c (bnc#1149713).\n- CVE-2019-15090: An issue was discovered in drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_dbg.c in the qedi_dbg_* family of functions, there is an out-of-bounds read (bnc#1146399).\n- CVE-2019-15098: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c had a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an endpoint descriptor (bnc#1146378).\n- CVE-2019-15117: parse_audio_mixer_unit in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux kernel mishandled a short descriptor, leading to out-of-bounds memory access (bnc#1145920).\n- CVE-2019-15118: check_input_term in sound/usb/mixer.c mishandled recursion, leading to kernel stack exhaustion (bnc#1145922).\n- CVE-2019-15211: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c did not properly allocate memory (bnc#1146519).\n- CVE-2019-15212: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel There was a double-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver (bnc#1146391 1146519).\n- CVE-2019-15212: There was a double-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver (bnc#1146391).\n- CVE-2019-15214: There was a use-after-free in the sound subsystem because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c (bnc#1146550).\n- CVE-2019-15215: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_usb.c driver (bnc#1146425).\n- CVE-2019-15216: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver (bnc#1146361).\n- CVE-2019-15217: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/zr364xx/zr364xx.c driver (bnc#1146547).\n- CVE-2019-15218: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver (bnc#1146413).\n- CVE-2019-15219: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver (bnc#1146524).\n- CVE-2019-15220: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/net/wireless/intersil/p54/p54usb.c driver (bnc#1146526).\n- CVE-2019-15221: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver (bnc#1146529).\n- CVE-2019-15222: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the sound/usb/helper.c (motu_microbookii) driver (bnc#1146531).\n- CVE-2019-15239: An incorrect backport of a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c fix allowed a local attacker to trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This could result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. (bsc#1146589)\n- CVE-2019-15290: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the ath6kl_usb_alloc_urb_from_pipe function (bsc#1146543).\n- CVE-2019-15291: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the flexcop_usb_probe function in the drivers/media/usb/b2c2/flexcop-usb.c driver (bnc#1146540).\n- CVE-2019-15292: There was a use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit, related to net/appletalk/atalk_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and net/appletalk/sysctl_net_atalk.c (bnc#1146678).\n- CVE-2019-15538: An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the Linux kernel XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS (bnc#1148093).\n- CVE-2019-15666: There was an out-of-bounds array access in __xfrm_policy_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because verify_newpolicy_info in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c mishandled directory validation (bnc#1148394).\n- CVE-2019-15902: Misuse of the upstream 'x86/ptrace: Fix possible spectre-v1 in ptrace_get_debugreg()' commit reintroduced the Spectre vulnerability that it aimed to eliminate. This occurred because the backport process depends on cherry picking specific commits, and because two (correctly ordered) code lines were swapped (bnc#1149376).\n- CVE-2019-15917: There was a use-after-free issue when hci_uart_register_dev() fails in hci_uart_set_proto() in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c (bnc#1149539).\n- CVE-2019-15919: SMB2_write in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free (bnc#1149552).\n- CVE-2019-15920: SMB2_read in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free. (bnc#1149626).\n- CVE-2019-15921: There was a memory leak issue when idr_alloc() fails in genl_register_family() in net/netlink/genetlink.c (bnc#1149602).\n- CVE-2019-15924: fm10k_init_module in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/fm10k/fm10k_main.c had a NULL pointer dereference because there was no -ENOMEM upon an alloc_workqueue failure (bnc#1149612).\n- CVE-2019-15926: An out-of-bounds access existed in the functions ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx and ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx in the file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c (bnc#1149527).\n- CVE-2019-15927: An issue was discovered in

At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process, because MSR_TM_ACTIVE is misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c.",

Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.",
