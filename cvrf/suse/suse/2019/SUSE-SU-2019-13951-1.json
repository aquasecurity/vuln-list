      "Text": "This update for python-numpy fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issue fixed:\n\n- CVE-2019-6446: Set allow_pickle to false by default to restrict loading untrusted content (bsc#1122208).\n  With this update we decrease the possibility of allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by\n  misusing numpy.load(). A warning during runtime will show-up when the allow_pickle is not explicitly set.\n  \nNOTE: By applying this update the behavior of python-numpy changes, which might break your application.\nIn order to get the old behaviour back, you have to explicitly set `allow_pickle` to True. Be aware\nthat this should only be done for trusted input, as loading untrusted input might lead to arbitrary code\nexecution.\n",

      "Description": "** DISPUTED **   An issue was discovered in NumPy 1.16.0 and earlier. It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources.",
