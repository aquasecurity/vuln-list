      "Text": "This update for libtcnative-1-0 to version 1.1.34 fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2017-15698: Fixed an improper handling of fields with more than 127 bytes \n  which could allow invalid client certificates to be accepted (bsc#1078679).\n- CVE-2018-8019: When using an OCSP responder did not correctly handle invalid\n  responses. This allowed for revoked client certificates to be incorrectly\n  identified. It was therefore possible for users to authenticate with revoked\n  certificates when using mutual TLS (bsc#1103348).\n- CVE-2018-8020: Did not properly check OCSP pre-produced responses. Revoked\n  client certificates may have not been properly identified, allowing for users\n  to authenticate with revoked certificates to connections that require mutual\n  TLS (bsc#1103347).\n\nFor a complete list of changes please see\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/native-1.1-doc/miscellaneous/changelog.html\n",

The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates that should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.",
