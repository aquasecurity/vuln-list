      "Text": "This update for clamav fixes the following issues:\n\nclamav was updated to 0.103.0 to implement jsc#ECO-3010 and bsc#1118459.\n\n* clamd can now reload the signature database without blocking\n  scanning. This multi-threaded database reload improvement was made\n  possible thanks to a community effort.\n  - Non-blocking database reloads are now the default behavior. Some\n    systems that are more constrained on RAM may need to disable\n    non-blocking reloads as it will temporarily consume two times as\n    much memory. We added a new clamd config option\n    ConcurrentDatabaseReload, which may be set to no.\n* Fix clamav-milter.service (requires clamd.service to run)\n* bsc#1119353, clamav-fips.patch: Fix freshclam crash in FIPS mode.\n* Partial sync with SLE15.\n\nUpdate to version 0.102.4\n\nAccumulated security fixes:\n\n* CVE-2020-3350: Fix a vulnerability wherein a malicious user could\n  replace a scan target's directory with a symlink to another path\n  to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or clamonacc into removing or moving\n  a different file (eg. a critical system file). The issue would\n  affect users that use the --move or --remove options for clamscan,\n  clamdscan, and clamonacc. (bsc#1174255)\n* CVE-2020-3327: Fix a vulnerability in the ARJ archive parsing\n  module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a Denial-of-Service\n  (DoS) condition. Improper bounds checking results in an\n  out-of-bounds read which could cause a crash. The previous fix for\n  this CVE in 0.102.3 was incomplete. This fix correctly resolves\n  the issue.\n* CVE-2020-3481: Fix a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in\n  ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n  condition. Improper error handling may result in a crash due to a\n  NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for\n  those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the\n  file type signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive\n  parser in versions affected by the vulnerability. (bsc#1174250)\n* CVE-2020-3341: Fix a vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in\n  ClamAV 0.101 - 0.102.2 that could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n  condition. Improper size checking of a buffer used to initialize AES\n  decryption routines results in an out-of-bounds read which may cause\n  a crash. (bsc#1171981)\n* CVE-2020-3123: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition may occur when\n  using the optional credit card data-loss-prevention (DLP) feature.\n  Improper bounds checking of an unsigned variable resulted in an\n  out-of-bounds read, which causes a crash.\n* CVE-2019-15961: A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability may\n  occur when scanning a specially crafted email file as a result\n  of excessively long scan times. The issue is resolved by\n  implementing several maximums in parsing MIME messages and by\n  optimizing use of memory allocation. (bsc#1157763).\n* CVE-2019-12900: An out of bounds write in the NSIS bzip2\n  (bsc#1149458)\n* CVE-2019-12625: Introduce a configurable time limit to mitigate\n  zip bomb vulnerability completely. Default is 2 minutes,\n  configurable useing the clamscan --max-scantime and for clamd\n  using the MaxScanTime config option (bsc#1144504)\n\nUpdate to version 0.101.3:\n\n* ZIP bomb causes extreme CPU spikes (bsc#1144504)\n\nUpdate to version 0.101.2 (bsc#1118459):\n\n* Support for RAR v5 archive extraction.\n* Incompatible changes to the arguments of cl_scandesc,\n  cl_scandesc_callback, and cl_scanmap_callback.\n* Scanning options have been converted from a single flag\n  bit-field into a structure of multiple categorized flag\n  bit-fields.\n* The CL_SCAN_HEURISTIC_ENCRYPTED scan option was replaced by\n  2 new scan options: CL_SCAN_HEURISTIC_ENCRYPTED_ARCHIVE, and\n  CL_SCAN_HEURISTIC_ENCRYPTED_DOC\n* Incompatible clamd.conf and command line interface changes.\n* Heuristic Alerts' (aka 'Algorithmic Detection') options have\n  been changed to make the names more consistent. The original\n  options are deprecated in 0.101, and will be removed in a\n  future feature release.\n* For details, see https://blog.clamav.net/2018/12/clamav-01010-has-been-released.html",
