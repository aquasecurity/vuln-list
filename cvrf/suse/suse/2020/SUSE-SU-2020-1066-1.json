The feature is experimental and many\n    users are reporting hard to diagnose problems on varied platforms.\n  * Seccomp is now marked EXPERIMENTAL, and must be explicitly\n    enabled by adding -o drop_privileges. Once we're more confident\n    with the usability of the feature, it will be enabled in -o modern,\n    like any other new change. You should only use it if you are\n    willing to carefully test it, especially if you're a vendor or\n    distribution.\n  * Also important is a crash fix in extstore when using the ASCII\n    protocol, large items, and running low on memory.\n\n- update to 1.5.8:\n  * Bugfixes for seccomp and extstore\n  * Extstore platform portability has been greatly improved for ARM\n    and 32bit systems\n- includes changes from 1.5.7:\n  * Fix alignment issues for 64bit ARM processors\n  * Fix seccomp portability\n  * Fix refcount leak with extstore while using binary touch commands\n\n- turn on the testsuite again, it seems to pass server side,\n  too\n\n- Home directory shouldn't be world readable bsc#1077718\n- Mention that this stream isn't affected by bsc#1085209,\n  CVE-2018-1000127 to make the checker bots happy.\n\nChanges in openstack-manila:\n- Update to version manila-5.1.1.dev5:\n  * Fix manila-tempest-minimal-dsvm-lvm-centos-7 job\n  * share\\_networks: enable project\\_only API only\n\nChanges in openstack-manila:\n- Rebased patches:\n  + cve-2020-9543-stable-pike.patch dropped (merged upstream)\n\n- Update to version manila-5.1.1.dev5:\n  * Fix manila-tempest-minimal-dsvm-lvm-centos-7 job\n  * share\\_networks: enable project\\_only API only\n\nChanges in openstack-neutron:\n- Update to version neutron-11.0.9.dev63:\n  * ovs agent: signal to plugin if tunnel refresh needed\n  * Do not initialize snat-ns twice\n\nChanges in openstack-neutron:\n- Update to version neutron-11.0.9.dev63:\n  * ovs agent: signal to plugin if tunnel refresh needed\n  * Do not initialize snat-ns twice\n\nChanges in openstack-nova:\n- Update to version nova-16.1.9.dev61:\n  * Avoid circular reference during serialization\n  * Mask the token used to allow access to consoles\n  * Improve metadata server performance with large security groups\n  * Remove exp legacy-tempest-dsvm-full-devstack-plugin-nfs\n\n- Update to version nova-16.1.9.dev54:\n  * pike-only: remove broken non-voting ceph jobs\n  * nova-live-migration: Wait for n-cpu services to come up after configuring Ceph\n  * rt: only map compute node if we created it\n\nChanges in openstack-nova:\n- Update to version nova-16.1.9.dev61:\n  * Avoid circular reference during serialization\n  * Mask the token used to allow access to consoles\n  * Improve metadata server performance with large security groups\n  * Remove exp legacy-tempest-dsvm-full-devstack-plugin-nfs\n\n- Update to version nova-16.1.9.dev54:\n  * pike-only: remove broken non-voting ceph jobs\n  * nova-live-migration: Wait for n-cpu services to come up after configuring Ceph\n  * rt: only map compute node if we created it\n\nChanges in pdns:\n- Add missing 'BuildRequires: libmysqlclient-devel' to allow\n  the package to build correctly.\n\n- CVE-2019-3871-auth-4.1.6.patch: fixes insufficient validation in\n  HTTP remote backend (bsc#1129734, CVE-2019-3871)\n\n- CVE-2018-10851-auth-4.1.4.patch: fixes DoS via crafted zone record\n  (bnc#1114157, CVE-2018-10851)\n- CVE-2018-14626-auth-4.1.4.patch: fixes an issue allowing a\n  remote user to craft a DNS query that will cause an answer without\n  DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache and be\n  returned to clients asking for DNSSEC records, thus hiding\n  the presence of DNSSEC signatures leading to a potential DoS\n  (bsc#1114169, CVE-2018-14626)\n\nChanges in python-amqp:\n- Make it build for SLE12SP3:\n  - remove pytest-sugar build dependency\n  - used %doc macro instead of %license\n- Removed patches that are already included in 2.4.2\n  - 0002-Do_not_send_AAAA_DNS_request_when_domain_resolved_to_IPv4_address.patch (SOC-9144)\n  - 0001-Always-treat-SSLError-timeouts-as-socket-timeouts-24.patch (bsc#1115904)\n- Update to 2.4.2:\n  - Added support for the Cygwin platform\n  - Correct offset incrementation when parsing bitmaps.\n  - Consequent bitmaps are now parsed correctly.\n- Better call of py.test\n- Add versions to dependencies\n- Remove python-sasl from build dependencies\n- Update to version 2.4.1\n  * To avoid breaking the API basic_consume() now returns the consumer tag\n    instead of a tuple when nowait is True.\n  * Fix crash in basic_publish when broker does not support connection.blocked\n    capability.\n  * read_frame() is now Python 3 compatible for large payloads.\n  * Support float read_timeout/write_timeout.\n  * Always treat SSLError timeouts as socket timeouts.\n  * Treat EWOULDBLOCK as timeout.\n- from 2.4.0\n  * Fix inconsistent frame_handler return value.\n    The function returned by frame_handler is meant to return True\n    once the complete message is received and the callback is called,\n    False otherwise.\n    This fixes the return value for messages with a body split across\n    multiple frames, and heartbeat frames.\n  * Don't default content_encoding to utf-8 for bytes.\n    This is not an acceptable default as the content may not be\n    valid utf-8, and even if it is, the producer likely does not\n    expect the message to be decoded by the consumer.\n  * Fix encoding of messages with multibyte characters.\n    Body length was previously calculated using string length,\n    which may be less than the length of the encoded body when\n    it contains multibyte sequences. This caused the body of\n    the frame to be truncated.\n  * Respect content_encoding when encoding messages.\n    Previously the content_encoding was ignored and messages\n    were always encoded as utf-8. This caused messages to be\n    incorrectly decoded if content_encoding is properly respected\n    when decoding.\n  * Fix AMQP protocol header for AMQP 0-9-1.\n    Previously it was set to a different value for unknown reasons.\n  * Add support for Python 3.7.\n    Change direct SSLSocket instantiation with wrap_socket.\n  * Add support for field type 'x' (byte array).\n  * If there is an exception raised on Connection.connect or\n    Connection.close, ensure that the underlying transport socket\n    is closed.  Adjust exception message on connection errors as well.\n  * TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has to be excluded from KNOWN_TCP_OPTS in BSD platforms.\n  * Handle negative acknowledgments.\n  * Added integration tests.\n  * Fix basic_consume() with no consumer_tag provided.\n  * Improved empty AMQPError string representation.\n  * Drain events before publish.\n    This is needed to capture out of memory messages for clients that only\n    publish. Otherwise on_blocked is never called.\n  * Don't revive channel when connection is closing.\n    When connection is closing don't raise error when Channel.Close\n    method is received.\n\nChanges in zookeeper:\n- Apply 0002-Apply-patch-to-resolve-CVE-2019-0201.patch\n  This applies the patch for ZOOKEEPER-1392 to resolve CVE-2019-0201\n  Should not allow to read ACL when not authorized to read node \n  (bsc#1135773)\n\n- Various cleanups in spec file\n\n- Fixed off-by-one in zkCleanTRX.sh and made output more useful (bsc#1048688, FATE#323204)\n\n- Fixed ExecStartPre statment in service file\n\n- added zkCleanTRX.sh to clean up 0 length transaction logs\n\n- Update to to zookeeper-3.4.10 (bsc#1040519)\n  * Fixes CVE-2017-5637\n- Remove Changes.txt (missing as of 3.4.10)\n\n",

ZooKeeper’s getACL() command doesn’t check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.",

      "Description": "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.2 and before 3.12.3, if an application using Puma allows untrusted input in a response header, an attacker can use newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`, `/n`) to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2019-16254, which fixed this vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby web server. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.",
