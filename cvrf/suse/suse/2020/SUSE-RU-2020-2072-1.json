0002-CVE-2020-12052-bsc1170657-XSS-annotation-popup-vulnerability.patch    \n  * Security: Fix annotation popup XSS vulnerability                             \n    (bsc#1170657) \n\n- Add CVE-2019-15043.patch (SOC-10357, CVE-2019-15043, bsc#1148383)\nChanges in keepalived:\n- update to 2.0.19\n- new BR pkgconfig(libnftnl) to fix nftables support\n- add nftables to the BR\n- added patch\n  * linux-4.15.patch\n- add buildrequires for file-devel\n  - used in the checker to verify scripts\n- enable json stats and config dump support\n  new BR: pkgconfig(json-c)\n- enable http regexp support: new BR pcre2-devel\n- disable dbus instance creation support as it is marked as\n  dangerous\n- Add BFD build option to keepalived.spec rpm file\n  Issue #1114 identified that the keepalived.spec file was not being\n  generated to build BFD support even if keepalived had been\n  configured to support it.\n- full changelog\n  https://keepalived.org/changelog.html\n\n- update to 1.4.5:\n  * Update snapcraft.yaml for 1.4.x+git\n  * Fix generation of git-commit.h with git commit number.\n  * Set virtual server address family correctly.\n  * Set virtual server address family correctly when using tunnelled\n    real servers.\n  * Fix handling of virtual servers with no real servers at config time.\n  * Add warning if virtual and real servers are different address families.\n    Although normally the virtual server and real servers must have the\n    same address family, if a real server is tunnelled, the address families\n    can be different. However, the kernel didn't support that until 3.18,\n    so add a check that the address families are the same if different\n    address families are not supported by the kernel.\n  * Send correct status in Dbus VrrpStatusChange notification.\n    When an instance transitioned from BACKUP to FAULT, the Dbus\n    status change message reported the old status (BACKUP) rather than\n    the new status (FAULT). This commit attempts to resolved that.\n  * doc: ipvs schedulers update\n  * Fix a couple of typos in configure.ac.\n  * Fix namespace collision with musl if_ether.h.\n  * Check if return value from read_value_block() is null before using.\n  * Fix reporting real server stats via SNMP.\n  * Make checker process handle RTM_NEWLINK messages with -a option\n    Even though the checker process doesn't subscribe to RTNLGRP_LINK\n    messages, it appears that older kernels (certainly 2.6.32) can\n    send RTM_NEWLINK (but not RTM_DELLINK) messages. This occurs\n    when the link is set to up state.\n    Only the VRRP process is interested in link messages, and so the\n    checker process doesn't do the necessary initialisation to be able\n    to handle RTM_NEWLINK messages.\n    This commit makes the checker process simply discard RTM_NEWLINK\n    and RTM_DELLINK messages, rather than assuming that if it receives\n    an RTM_NEWLINK message it must be the VRRP process.\n    This problem was reported in issue #848 since the checker process\n    was segfaulting when a new interface was added when the -a command\n    line option was specified.\n  * Fix handling RTM_NEWLINK when building without VRRP code.\n  * Fix building on Fedora 28.\n    net-snmp-config output can include compiler and linker flags that\n    refer to spec files that were used to build net-snmp but may not\n    exist on the system building keepalived. That would cause the build\n    done by configure to test for net-snmp support to fail; in particular\n    on a Fedora 28 system that doesn't have the redhat-rpm-config package\n    installed.\n    This commit checks that any spec files in the compiler and linker\n    flags returned by net-snmp-config exist on the system building\n    keepalived, and if not it removes the reference(s) to the spec file(s).\n  * keepalived-1.4.3 released.\n  * vrrp: setting '0' as default value for ifa_flags to make gcc happy.\n  * Add additional libraries when testing for presence of SSL_CTX_new().\n    It appears that some systems need -lcrypto when linking with -lssl.\n  * Sanitise checking of libnl3 in configure.ac.\n  * Report and handle missing '}'s in config files.\n  * Add missing '\\n' in keepalived.data output.\n  * Stop backup taking over as master while master reloads.\n    If a reload was initiated just before an advert, and since it took\n    one advert interval after a reload before an advert was sent, if the\n    reload itself took more than one advert interval, the backup could\n    time out and take over as master.\n    This commit makes keepalived send adverts for all instances that are\n    master immediately before a reload, and also sends adverts immediately\n    after a reload, thereby trippling the time available for the reload\n    to complete.\n  * Add route option fastopen_no_cookie and rule option l3mdev.\n  * Fix errors in KEEPALIVED-MIB.txt.\n  * Simplify setting on IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE.\n  * Cosmetic changes to keepalived(8) man page.\n  * Don't set ipvs sync daemon to master state before becoming master\n    If a vrrp instance which was the one specified for the ipvs sync\n    daemon was configured with initial state master, the sync daemon\n    was being set to master mode before the vrrp instance transitioned\n    to master mode. This caused an error message when the vrrp instance\n    transitioned to master and attempted to make the sync daemon go from\n    backup to master mode.\n    This commit stops setting the sync daemon to master mode at initialisation\n    time, and it is set to master mode when the vrrp instance transitions\n    to master.\n  * Fix freeing vector which has not had any entries allocated.\n  * Add additional mem-check disgnostics\n    vector_alloc, vectot_alloc_slot, vector_free and alloc_strvec all\n    call MALLOC/FREE but the functions written in the mem_check log\n    are vector_alloc etc, not the functions that call them.\n    This commit adds logging of the originating calling function.\n  * Fix memory leak in parser.c.\n  * Improve alignment of new mem-check logging.\n  * Disable all checkers on a virtual server when ha_suspend set.\n    Only the first checker was being disabled; this commit now disables\n    all of them.\n    Also, make the decision to disable a checker when starting/reloading\n    when scheduling the checker, so that the existance of the required\n    address can be checked.\n  * Stop genhash segfaulting when built with --enable-mem-check.\n  * Fix memory allocation problems in genhash.\n  * Properly fix memory allocation problems in genhash.\n  * Fix persistence_granularity IPv4 netmask validation.\n    The logic test from inet_aton() appears to be inverted.\n  * Fix segfault when checker configuration is missing expected parameter\n    Issue #806 mentioned as an aside that 'nb_get_retry' without a parameter\n    was sigfaulting. Commit be7ae80 - 'Stop segfaulting when configuration\n    keyword is missing its parameter' missed the 'hidden' uses of vector_slot()\n    (i.e. those used via definitions in header files).\n    This commit now updates those uses of vector_slot() to use strvec_slot()\n    instead.\n  * Fix compiling on Linux 2.x kernels.\n    There were missing checks for HAVE_DECL_CLONE_NEWNET causing\n    references to an undeclared variable if CLONE_NEWNET wasn't defined.\n  * Improve parsing of kernel release.\n    The kernel EXTRAVERSION can start with any character (although\n    starting with a digit would be daft), so relax the check for it\n    starting with a '-'. Kernels using both '+' and '.' being the\n    first character of EXTRAVERSION have been reported.\n  * Improve grammer.\n  * add support for SNI in SSL_GET check.\n    this adds a `enable_sni` parameter to SSL_GET, making sure the check\n    passes the virtualhost in the SNI extension during SSL handshake.\n  * Optimise setting host name for SSL_GET requests with SNI.\n  * Allow SNI to be used with SSL_GET with OpenSSL v1.0.0 and LibreSSL.\n  * Use configure to check for SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()\n    Rather than checking for a specific version of the OpenSSL library\n    (and it would also need checking the version of the LibreSSL library)\n    let configure check for the presence of SSL_set_tlsext_host_name().\n    Also omit all code related to SNI of SSL_set_tlsext_host_name() is\n    not available.\n  * Use configure to determine available OpenSSL functionality\n    Rather than using version numbers of the OpenSSL library to determine\n    what functions are available, let configure determine whether the\n    functions are supported.\n    The also means that the same tests work for LibreSSL.\n  * Add support for gratuitous ARPs for IP over Infiniband.\n  * Use system header definition instead of local definition IF_HWADDR_MAX\n    linux/netdevice.h has definition MAX_ADDR_LEN, which is 32, whereas\n    IF_HWADDR_MAX was locally defined to be 20.\n    Unfortunately we end up with more system header file juggling to ensure\n    we don't have duplicate definitions.\n  * Fix vrrp_script and check_misc scripts of type \u003c/dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/80.\n  * Add the first pre-defined config definition (${_PWD})\n    ${_PWD} in a configuration file will be replaced with the full\n    path name of the directory that keepalived is reading the current\n    configuration file from.\n  * Open and run the notify fifo and script if no other fifo\n    Due to the way the code was structured the notify_fifo for both\n    checker and vrrp messages wasn't run if neither the vrrp or checker\n    fifo wasn't configured.\n    Also, if all three fifos were configured, the general fifo script\n    was executed by both the vrrp and checker process, causing problems.\n  * Add support for Infiniband interfaces when dumping configuration.\n  * Tidy up layout in vrrp_arp.c.\n  * Add configure check for support of position independant executables (PIE).\n  * Add check for -pie support, and fix writing to keepalived.data.\n  * keepalived-1.4.2 released.\n  * Make genhash exit with exit code 1 on error.\n    Issue #766 identified that genhash always exits with exit code 1\n    even if an error has occurred.\n  * Rationalise printing of http header in genhash.\n  * Use http header Content-Length field in HTTP_CHECK/SSL_CHECK.\n    If a Content-Length is supplied in the http header, use that as a\n    limit to the data length (as wget does). If the length of data\n    received does not match the Content-Length log a warning.\n  * Optimise parameter passing to fprintf in genhash.\n  * Don't declare mark variable if don't have MARK socket option.\n  * Fix sync groups with only one member.\n    Commit c88744a0 allowed sync groups with only 1 member again, but\n    didn't stop removing the sync group if there was only 1 member.\n    This commit now doesn't remove sync groups with only one member.\n  * Make track scripts work with --enable-debug config option.\n  * Add warning if --enable-debug configure option is used.\n  * Allow more flexibility of layout of { and } in config files.\n    keepalived was a bit fussy about where '{'s and '}'s (braces) could\n    be placed in terms of after the keyword, or on a line on their own.\n    It certainly was not possible to have multiple braces on one line.\n    This commit now provides complete flexibility of where braces are, so\n    long as they occur in the correct order.\n  * Make alloc_value_block() report block type if there is an error.\n  * Simplify alloc_value_block() by using libc string functions.\n  * Add dumping of garp delay config when using -d option.\n  * Fix fractions of seconds for garp group garp_interval.\n  * Make read_value_block() use alloc_value_block().\n    This removes quite a bit of duplication of functionality, and\n    ensures the configuration parsing will be more consistent.\n  * Fix build with Linux kernel headers v4.15.\n    Linux kernel version 4.15 changed the libc/kernel headers suppression\n    logic in a way that introduces collisions.\n  * Add missing command line options to keepalived(8) man page.\n  * Fix --dont-release-vrrp.\n    On github, ushuz reported that commit 62e8455 - 'Don't delete vmac\n    interfaces before dropping multicast membership' broke --dont-release-vrrp.\n    This commit restores the correct functionality.\n  * Define _GNU_SOURCE for all compilation units.\n    Rather than defining _GNU_SOURCE when needed, let configure add\n    it to the flags passed to the C compiler, so that it is defined\n    for all compilation units. This ensures consistence.\n  * Fix new warnings procuded by gcc 8.\n  * Fix dumping empty lists.\n    Add a check in dump_list() for an empty list, and don't attempt\n    to dump it if it is empty.\n  * Resolve conversion-check compiler warnings.\n  * Add missing content to installing_keepalived.rst documentation.\n    Issue #778 identified that there was text missing at the end of\n    the document, and that is now added.\n  * Fix systemd service to start after network-online.target.\n    This fix was merged downstream by RedHat in response to\n    RHBZ #1413320.\n  * Update INSTALL file to describe packages needed for building\n    documentation.\n  * INSTALL: note linux distro package that provides 'sphinx_rtd_theme'\n  * Clear /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/IF/disable_ipv6 when create VMACs.\n    An issue was identified where keepalived was reporting permission\n    denied when attempting to add an IPv6 address to a VMAC interface.\n    It turned out that this was because\n    /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/disable_ipv6\n    was set to 1, causing IPv6 to be disables on all interfaces that\n    keepalived created.\n    This commit clears disable_ipv6 on any VMAC interfaces that\n    keepalived creates if the vrrp instance is using IPv6.\n- remove linux-4.15.patch: does not apply anymore and not needed\n  (the distros using 4.15 have moved on to keepalived 2.x)\n\n- Only Require insserv on distributions without systemd.\n- Fix systemd related requires/buildRequires\n- Do not run scriptlets that use insserv when using systemd\n\n- add linux-4.15.patch\n\nChanges in kibana:\n- Add 0001-Configurable-custom-response-headers-for-server.patch\n  (bsc#1171909, CVE-2020-10743)\n\nChanges in memcached:\n- version update to 1.5.17\n  * bugfixes\n    fix strncpy call in stats conns to avoid ASAN violation (bsc#1149110, CVE-2019-15026)\n    extstore: fix indentation\n    add error handling when calling dup function\n    add unlock when item_cachedump malloc failed\n    extstore: emulate pread(v) for macOS\n    fix off-by-one in logger to allow CAS commands to be logged.\n    use strdup for explicitly configured slab sizes\n    move mem_requested from slabs.c to items.c (internal cleanup)\n  * new features\n    add server address to the 'stats conns' output\n    log client connection id with fetchers and mutations\n    Add a handler for seccomp crashes\n- version update to 1.5.16\n  * bugfixes\n    When nsuffix is 0 space for flags hasn't been allocated so don't memcpy them.\n- version update to 1.5.15\n  * bugfixes\n    Speed up incr/decr by replacing snprintf.\n    Use correct buffer size for internal URI encoding.\n    change some links from http to https\n    Fix small memory leak in testapp.c.\n    free window_global in slab_automove_extstore.c\n    remove inline_ascii_response option\n    -Y [filename] for ascii authentication mode\n    fix: idle-timeout wasn't compatible with binprot\n  * features\n    -Y [authfile] enables an authentication mode for ASCII protocol.\n- modified patches\n  % memcached-autofoo.patch (refreshed)\n\n- version update to 1.5.14\n  * update -h output for -I (max item size)\n  * fix segfault in 'lru' command (bsc#1133817, CVE-2019-11596)\n  * fix compile error on centos7\n  * extstore: error adjusting page_size after ext_path\n  * extstore: fix segfault if page_count is too high.\n  * close delete + incr item survival race bug\n  * memcached-tool dump fix loss of exp value\n  * Fix 'qw' in 'MemcachedTest.pm' so wait_ext_flush is exported properly\n  * Experimental TLS support.\n  * Basic implementation of TLS for memcached.\n  * Improve Get And Touch documentation\n  * fix INCR/DECR refcount leak for invalid items\n- modified patches\n  % memcached-autofoo.patch (refreshed)\n\n- Version bump to 1.5.11:\n  * extstore: balance IO thread queues\n- Drop memcached-fix_test.patch that is present now upstream\n\n- Add patch to fix aarch64, ppc64* and s390x tests:\n  * memcached-fix_test.patch\n\n- Fix linter errors regarding COPYING\n\n- update to 1.5.10:\n  * disruptive change in extstore: -o ext_page_count= is deprecated\n    and no longer works.

These\n    work like wchar_t: they represent one unicode character, or when\n    used as charN_t * or charN_t[] they represent a unicode string.\n    The difference with wchar_t is that they have a known, fixed\n    size. They should work at all places that used to work with\n    wchar_t (please report an issue if I missed something). Note\n    that with set_source(), you need to make sure that these types\n    are actually defined by the C source you provide (if used in\n    cdef()).\n  * Support the C99 types float _Complex and double _Complex. Note\n    that libffi doesn’t support them, which means that in the ABI\n    mode you still cannot call C functions that take complex\n    numbers directly as arguments or return type.\n  * Fixed a rare race condition when creating multiple FFI instances\n    from multiple threads. (Note that you aren’t meant to create\n    many FFI instances: in inline mode, you should write\n    ffi = cffi.FFI() at module level just after import cffi; and in\n    out-of-line mode you don’t instantiate FFI explicitly at all.)\n  * Windows: using callbacks can be messy because the CFFI internal\n    error messages show up to stderr—but stderr goes nowhere in many\n    applications. This makes it particularly hard to get started\n    with the embedding mode. (Once you get started, you can at least\n    use @ffi.def_extern(onerror=...) and send the error logs where\n    it makes sense for your application, or record them in log\n    files, and so on.) So what is new in CFFI is that now, on\n    Windows CFFI will try to open a non-modal MessageBox (in addition\n    to sending raw messages to stderr). The MessageBox is only\n    visible if the process stays alive: typically, console\n    applications that crash close immediately, but that is also the\n    situation where stderr should be visible anyway.\n  * Progress on support for callbacks in NetBSD.\n  * Functions returning booleans would in some case still return 0\n    or 1 instead of False or True. Fixed.\n  * ffi.gc() now takes an optional third parameter, which gives an\n    estimate of the size (in bytes) of the object. So far, this is\n    only used by PyPy, to make the next GC occur more quickly\n    (issue #320). In the future, this might have an effect on\n    CPython too (provided the CPython issue 31105 is addressed).\n  * Add a note to the documentation: the ABI mode gives function\n    objects that are slower to call than the API mode does. For\n    some reason it is often thought to be faster. It is not!\n- Update to 1.10.1:\n  * Fixed the line numbers reported in case of cdef() errors. Also,\n    I just noticed, but pycparser always supported the preprocessor\n    directive # 42 'foo.h' to mean “from the next line, we’re in\n    file foo.h starting from line 42”, which it puts in the error\n    messages. \n\n- update to 1.10.0:\n * Issue #295: use calloc() directly instead of PyObject_Malloc()+memset()\n   to handle ffi.new() with a default allocator. Speeds up ffi.new(large-array)\n   where most of the time you never touch most of the array.\n  * Some OS/X build fixes (“only with Xcode but without CLT”).\n  * Improve a couple of error messages: when getting mismatched versions of\n    cffi and its backend; and when calling functions which cannot be called with\n    libffi because an argument is a struct that is “too complicated” (and not\n    a struct pointer, which always works).\n  * Add support for some unusual compilers (non-msvc, non-gcc, non-icc, non-clang)\n  * Implemented the remaining cases for ffi.from_buffer. Now all\n    buffer/memoryview objects can be passed. The one remaining check is against\n    passing unicode strings in Python 2. (They support the buffer interface, but\n    that gives the raw bytes behind the UTF16/UCS4 storage, which is most of the\n    times not what you expect. In Python 3 this has been fixed and the unicode\n    strings don’t support the memoryview interface any more.)\n  * The C type _Bool or bool now converts to a Python boolean when reading,\n    instead of the content of the byte as an integer. The potential\n    incompatibility here is what occurs if the byte contains a value different\n    from 0 and 1. Previously, it would just return it; with this change, CFFI\n    raises an exception in this case. But this case means “undefined behavior”\n    in C; if you really have to interface with a library relying on this,\n    don’t use bool in the CFFI side. Also, it is still valid to use a byte\n    string as initializer for a bool[], but now it must only contain \\x00 or\n    \\x01. As an aside, ffi.string() no longer works on bool[] (but it never made\n    much sense, as this function stops at the first zero).\n  * ffi.buffer is now the name of cffi’s buffer type, and ffi.buffer() works\n    like before but is the constructor of that type.\n  * ffi.addressof(lib, 'name') now works also in in-line mode, not only in\n    out-of-line mode. This is useful for taking the address of global variables.\n  * Issue #255: cdata objects of a primitive type (integers, floats, char) are\n    now compared and ordered by value. For example, \u003ccdata 'int' 42\u003e compares\n    equal to 42 and \u003ccdata 'char' b'A'\u003e compares equal to b'A'. Unlike C,\n    \u003ccdata 'int' -1\u003e does not compare equal to ffi.cast('unsigned int', -1): it\n    compares smaller, because -1 \u003c 4294967295.\n  * PyPy: ffi.new() and ffi.new_allocator()() did not record “memory pressure”,\n    causing the GC to run too infrequently if you call ffi.new() very often\n    and/or with large arrays. Fixed in PyPy 5.7.\n  * Support in ffi.cdef() for numeric expressions with + or -. Assumes that\n    there is no overflow; it should be fixed first before we add more general\n    support for arbitrary arithmetic on constants.\n\n- do not generate HTML documentation for packages that are indirect\n  dependencies of Sphinx\n  (see docs at https://cffi.readthedocs.org/ )\n\n- update to 1.9.1\n  - Structs with variable-sized arrays as their last field: now we track the\n    length of the array after ffi.new() is called, just like we always tracked\n    the length of ffi.new('int[]', 42). This lets us detect out-of-range\n    accesses to array items. This also lets us display a better repr(), and\n    have the total size returned by ffi.sizeof() and ffi.buffer(). Previously\n    both functions would return a result based on the size of the declared\n    structure type, with an assumed empty array. (Thanks andrew for starting\n    this refactoring.)\n  - Add support in cdef()/set_source() for unspecified-length arrays in\n    typedefs: typedef int foo_t[...];. It was already supported for global\n    variables or structure fields.\n  - I turned in v1.8 a warning from cffi/model.py into an error: 'enum xxx' has\n    no values explicitly defined: refusing to guess which integer type it is\n    meant to be (unsigned/signed, int/long). Now I’m turning it back to a\n    warning again; it seems that guessing that the enum has size int is a\n    99%-safe bet. (But not 100%, so it stays as a warning.)\n  - Fix leaks in the code handling FILE * arguments. In CPython 3 there is a\n    remaining issue that is hard to fix: if you pass a Python file object to a\n    FILE * argument, then os.dup() is used and the new file descriptor is only\n    closed when the GC reclaims the Python file object—and not at the earlier\n    time when you call close(), which only closes the original file descriptor.\n    If this is an issue, you should avoid this automatic convertion of Python\n    file objects: instead, explicitly manipulate file descriptors and call\n    fdopen() from C (...via cffi).\n  - When passing a void * argument to a function with a different pointer type,\n    or vice-versa, the cast occurs automatically, like in C. The same occurs\n    for initialization with ffi.new() and a few other places. However, I\n    thought that char * had the same property—but I was mistaken. In C you get\n    the usual warning if you try to give a char * to a char ** argument, for\n    example. Sorry about the confusion. This has been fixed in CFFI by giving\n    for now a warning, too. It will turn into an error in a future version.\n  - Issue #283: fixed ffi.new() on structures/unions with nested anonymous\n    structures/unions, when there is at least one union in the mix. When\n    initialized with a list or a dict, it should now behave more closely like\n    the { } syntax does in GCC.\n  - CPython 3.x: experimental: the generated C extension modules now use the\n    “limited API”, which means that, as a compiled .so/.dll, it should work\n    directly on any version of CPython \u003e= 3.2. The name produced by distutils\n    is still version-specific. To get the version-independent name, you can\n    rename it manually to NAME.abi3.so, or use the very recent setuptools 26.\n  - Added ffi.compile(debug=...), similar to python setup.py build --debug but\n    defaulting to True if we are running a debugging version of Python itself.\n  - Removed the restriction that ffi.from_buffer() cannot be used on byte\n    strings. Now you can get a char * out of a byte string, which is valid as\n    long as the string object is kept alive. (But don’t use it to modify the\n    string object! If you need this, use bytearray or other official\n    techniques.)\n  - PyPy 5.4 can now pass a byte string directly to a char * argument (in older\n    versions, a copy would be made). This used to be a CPython-only\n    optimization.\n  - ffi.gc(p, None) removes the destructor on an object previously created by\n    another call to ffi.gc()\n  - bool(ffi.cast('primitive type', x)) now returns False if the value is zero\n    (including -0.0), and True otherwise. Previously this would only return\n    False for cdata objects of a pointer type when the pointer is NULL.\n  - bytearrays: ffi.from_buffer(bytearray-object) is now supported. (The reason\n    it was not supported was that it was hard to do in PyPy, but it works since\n    PyPy 5.3.) To call a C function with a char * argument from a buffer\n    object—now including bytearrays—you write lib.foo(ffi.from_buffer(x)).\n    Additionally, this is now supported: p[0:length] = bytearray-object. The\n    problem with this was that a iterating over bytearrays gives numbers\n    instead of characters. (Now it is implemented with just a memcpy, of\n    course, not actually iterating over the characters.)\n  - C++: compiling the generated C code with C++ was supposed to work, but\n    failed if you make use the bool type (because that is rendered as the C\n    _Bool type, which doesn’t exist in C++).\n  - help(lib) and help(lib.myfunc) now give useful information, as well as\n    dir(p) where p is a struct or pointer-to-struct.\n- drop upstreamed python-cffi-avoid-bitshifting-negative-int.patch\n\n- update for multipython build\n\n- Add python-cffi-avoid-bitshifting-negative-int.patch to actually\n  fix the 'negative left shift' warning by replacing bitshifting\n  in appropriate places by bitwise and comparison to self; patch\n  taken from upstream git.

The error message was:\n      ValueError: underlying buffer has been detached\n\n- %python3_only -\u003e %python_alternative\n\n- update to 1.4.3\n  * Waitress did not properly validate that the HTTP headers it received \n    were properly formed, thereby potentially allowing a front-end server \n    to treat a request different from Waitress. This could lead to HTTP \n    request smuggling/splitting.\n- drop patch local-intersphinx-inventories.patch\n  * it was commented out, anyway\n\n- update to 1.4.0:\n  - Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without\n  setting the ``Connection: close`` header as appropriate in the response. This\n  is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when\n  responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500\n  Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the\n  connection after the response is sent.\n  - Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name\n  and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not\n  vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent\n  back a 400 Bad Request. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273\n  - CRLR handling Security fixes\n\n- update to 1.3.1\n  * Waitress won’t accidentally throw away part of the path if it \n    starts with a double slash\n\n- version update to 1.3.0\n  Deprecations\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  - The ``send_bytes`` adjustment now defaults to ``1`` and is deprecated\n    pending removal in a future release.\n    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/246\n  Features\n  ~~~~~~~~\n  - Add a new ``outbuf_high_watermark`` adjustment which is used to apply\n    backpressure on the ``app_iter`` to avoid letting it spin faster than data\n    can be written to the socket. This stabilizes responses that iterate quickly\n    with a lot of data.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/242\n  - Stop early and close the ``app_iter`` when attempting to write to a closed\n    socket due to a client disconnect. This should notify a long-lived streaming\n    response when a client hangs up.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/238\n    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/240\n    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/241\n  - Adjust the flush to output ``SO_SNDBUF`` bytes instead of whatever was\n    set in the ``send_bytes`` adjustment. ``send_bytes`` now only controls how\n    much waitress will buffer internally before flushing to the kernel, whereas\n    previously it used to also throttle how much data was sent to the kernel.\n    This change enables a streaming ``app_iter`` containing small chunks to\n    still be flushed efficiently.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/246\n  Bugfixes\n  ~~~~~~~~\n  - Upon receiving a request that does not include HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 we will\n    no longer set the version to the string value 'None'. See\n    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/252 and\n    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/110\n  - When a client closes a socket unexpectedly there was potential for memory\n    leaks in which data was written to the buffers after they were closed,\n    causing them to reopen.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/239\n  - Fix the queue depth warnings to only show when all threads are busy.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/243\n    and https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/247\n  - Trigger the ``app_iter`` to close as part of shutdown. This will only be\n    noticeable for users of the internal server api. In more typical operations\n    the server will die before benefiting from these changes.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/245\n  - Fix a bug in which a streaming ``app_iter`` may never cleanup data that has\n    already been sent. This would cause buffers in waitress to grow without\n    bounds. These buffers now properly rotate and release their data.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/242\n  - Fix a bug in which non-seekable subclasses of ``io.IOBase`` would trigger\n    an exception when passed to the ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` callback.\n    See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/249\n\n- Trim marketing wording and other platform mentions.\n\n- Add fetch-intersphinx-inventories.sh to sources\n- Add local-intersphinx-inventories.patch for generating the docs\n  correctly\n\n- update to version 1.2.1:\n  too many changes to list here, see:\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/blob/master/CHANGES.txt\n  or even:\n  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commits/master\n\n- Remove superfluous devel dependency for noarch package\n\n- update to version 1.1.0:\n  * Features\n    + Waitress now has a __main__ and thus may be called with 'python\n      -mwaitress'\n  * Bugfixes\n    + Waitress no longer allows lowercase HTTP verbs. This change was\n      made to fall in line with most HTTP servers. See\n      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/170\n    + When receiving non-ascii bytes in the request URL, waitress will\n      no longer abruptly close the connection, instead returning a 400\n      Bad Request. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/162 and\n      https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/64\n\n- Update to 1.0.2\n  * Python 3.6 is now officially supported in Waitress\n  * Add a work-around for libc issue on Linux not following the\n    documented standards. If getnameinfo() fails because of DNS not\n    being available it should return the IP address instead of the\n    reverse DNS entry, however instead getnameinfo() raises. We\n    catch this, and ask getnameinfo() for the same information\n    again, explicitly asking for IP address instead of reverse\n    DNS hostname.\n- Implement single-spec version.\n- Fix source URL.\n\n- update to 1.0.1:\n  - IPv6 support on Windows was broken due to missing constants in the socket\n    module. This has been resolved by setting the constants on Windows if they\n    are missing. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/138\n  - A ValueError was raised on Windows when passing a string for the port, on\n    Windows in Python 2 using service names instead of port numbers doesn't work\n    with `getaddrinfo`. This has been resolved by attempting to convert the port\n    number to an integer, if that fails a ValueError will be raised. See\n    https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/139\n  - Removed `AI_ADDRCONFIG` from the call to `getaddrinfo`, this resolves an\n    issue whereby `getaddrinfo` wouldn't return any addresses to `bind` to on\n    hosts where there is no internet connection but localhost is requested to be\n    bound to. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/131 for more\n    information.\n- disable tests. need network access.\n\nChanges in rabbitmq-server:\n- Apply patches to resolve CVE-2017-4967,CVE-2017-4965 (bsc#1037777)\n   0001-Escape-HTML-tags-in-policy-definition-fields.patch\n   0002-Don-t-echo-provided-encoding-value-back.patch\n   0003-Strip-off-pids-and-format-consumer-details-for-2-end.patch\n   0004-Format-Web-contexts.patch\n\nChanges in release-notes-suse-openstack-cloud:\n- Switch github URL from git@ to https:// to bypass authentication \n\nChanges in rubygem-activeresource:\n- Add bsc#1171560-CVE-2020-8151-encode-id-param.patch\n  Prevent possible information disclosure issue that could allow\n  an attacker to create specially crafted requests to access data\n  in an unexpected way (bsc#1171560 CVE-2020-8151)) \n\nChanges in rubygem-crowbar-client:\n- Update to 3.9.2\n  - Enable SES commands in Cloud8 (SOC-11122)\n\nChanges in rubygem-json-1_7:\n- Add CVE-2020-10663.patch (CVE-2020-10663, bsc#1167244)\n\nChanges in rubygem-puma:\n- Fix indentation in gem2rpm.yml \n\n- Add CVE-2020-11077.patch (bsc#1172175, CVE-2020-11077)\n- Add chunked-request-handling.patch (needed for CVE-2020-11076.patch)\n- Add CVE-2020-11076.patch (bsc#1172176, CVE-2020-11076)\n- Add all patches to gem2rpm.yml\n\n- Add CVE-2020-5247.patch (bsc#1165402)\n  'Fixes a problem where we were not splitting newlines in headers\n  according to Rack spec'\n  The patch is reduced compared to the upstream version, which was\n  patching also the parts that are not implemented in our old Puma\n  version.

      "Description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230 which states: \"Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.

Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.",

      "Description": "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar but different vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.",

This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2019-16254, which fixed this vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby web server. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.",
