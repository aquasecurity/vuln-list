See upstream changelog in the packaged\n  /usr/share/doc/packages/docker/CHANGELOG.md. CVE-2020-15257 bsc#1180243\n  https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v19.03.14\n\n- Enable fish-completion\n\n- Add a patch which makes Docker compatible with firewalld with\n  nftables backend. Backport of https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/pull/2548\n  (bsc#1178801, SLE-16460)\n\n- Update to Docker 19.03.13-ce. See upstream changelog in the packaged\n  /usr/share/doc/packages/docker/CHANGELOG.md. bsc#1176708\n\n- Fixes for %_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec (bsc#1174075)\n\n- Emergency fix: %requires_eq does not work with provide symbols,\n  only effective package names. Convert back to regular Requires.\n\n- Update to Docker 19.03.12-ce. See upstream changelog in the packaged\n  /usr/share/doc/packages/docker/CHANGELOG.md.\n- Use Go 1.13 instead of Go 1.14 because Go 1.14 can cause all sorts of\n  spurrious errors due to Go returning -EINTR from I/O syscalls much more often\n  (due to Go 1.14's pre-emptive goroutine support).\n- Add BuildRequires for all -git dependencies so that we catch missing\n  dependencies much more quickly.\n\n- Update to libnetwork 55e924b8a842, which is required for Docker 19.03.14-ce.\n  bsc#1180243\n\n- Add patch which makes libnetwork compatible with firewalld with\n  nftables backend. Backport of https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/pull/2548\n  (bsc#1178801, SLE-16460)\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2020-15257",
      "Description": "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shimâ€™s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.",
