      "Text": "\n  \ngo1.15 (released 2020-08-11) Go 1.15 is a major release of Go.\n\ngo1.15.x minor releases will be provided through August 2021.\n\n  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle\n\nMost changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime,\nand libraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise\nof compatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to\ncompile and run as before.\n\n* See release notes https://golang.org/doc/go1.15. Excerpts\n  relevant to OBS environment and for SUSE/openSUSE follow:\n* Module support in the go command is ready for production use,\n  and we encourage all users to migrate to Go modules for\n  dependency management.\n* Module cache: The location of the module cache may now be set\n  with the GOMODCACHE environment variable. The default value of\n  GOMODCACHE is GOPATH[0]/pkg/mod, the location of the module\n  cache before this change.\n* Compiler flag parsing: Various flag parsing issues in go test\n  and go vet have been fixed. Notably, flags specified in\n  GOFLAGS are handled more consistently, and the -outputdir flag\n  now interprets relative paths relative to the working\n  directory of the go command (rather than the working directory\n  of each individual test).\n* The GOPROXY environment variable now supports skipping proxies\n  that return errors. Proxy URLs may now be separated with\n  either commas (,) or pipe characters (|). If a proxy URL is\n  followed by a comma, the go command will only try the next\n  proxy in the list after a 404 or 410 HTTP response. If a proxy\n  URL is followed by a pipe character, the go command will try\n  the next proxy in the list after any error. Note that the\n  default value of GOPROXY remains\n  https://proxy.golang.org,direct, which does not fall back to\n  direct in case of errors.\n* On a Unix system, if the kill command or kill system call is\n  used to send a SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, or SIGFPE signal to a Go\n  program, and if the signal is not being handled via\n  os/signal.Notify, the Go program will now reliably crash with\n  a stack trace. In earlier releases the behavior was\n  unpredictable.\n* Allocation of small objects now performs much better at high\n  core counts, and has lower worst-case latency.\n* Go 1.15 reduces typical binary sizes by around 5% compared to\n  Go 1.14 by eliminating certain types of GC metadata and more\n  aggressively eliminating unused type metadata.\n* The toolchain now mitigates Intel CPU erratum SKX102 on\n  GOARCH=amd64 by aligning functions to 32 byte boundaries and\n  padding jump instructions. While this padding increases binary\n  sizes, this is more than made up for by the binary size\n  improvements mentioned above.\n* Go 1.15 adds a -spectre flag to both the compiler and the\n  assembler, to allow enabling Spectre mitigations. These should\n  almost never be needed and are provided mainly as a 'defense\n  in depth' mechanism. See the Spectre Go wiki page for details.\n* The compiler now rejects //go: compiler directives that have\n  no meaning for the declaration they are applied to with a\n  'misplaced compiler directive' error. Such misapplied\n  directives were broken before, but were silently ignored by\n  the compiler.\n* Substantial improvements to the Go linker, which reduce linker\n  resource usage (both time and memory) and improve code\n  robustness/maintainability. Linking is 20% faster and requires\n  30% less memory on average. These changes are part of a\n  multi-release project to modernize the Go linker, meaning that\n  there will be additional linker improvements expected in\n  future releases.\n* The linker now defaults to internal linking mode for\n  -buildmode=pie on linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, so these\n  configurations no longer require a C linker.\n* There has been progress in improving the stability and\n  performance of the 64-bit RISC-V port on Linux (GOOS=linux,\n  GOARCH=riscv64). It also now supports asynchronous preemption.\n* crypto/x509: The deprecated, legacy behavior of treating the\n  CommonName field on X.509 certificates as a host name when no\n  Subject Alternative Names are present is now disabled by\n  default. It can be temporarily re-enabled by adding the value\n  x509ignoreCN=0 to the GODEBUG environment variable. Note that\n  if the CommonName is an invalid host name, it's always\n  ignored, regardless of GODEBUG settings. Invalid names include\n  those with any characters other than letters, digits, hyphens\n  and underscores, and those with empty labels or trailing dots.\n* crypto/x509: go1.15 applications with an AWS DB instance that\n  was created or updated to the rds-ca-2019 certificate prior to\n  July 28, 2020, you must update the certificate again. If you\n  created your DB instance or updated its certificate after July\n  28, 2020, no action is required.
