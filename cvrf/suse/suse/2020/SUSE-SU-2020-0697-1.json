      "Text": "This update for cni, cni-plugins, conmon, fuse-overlayfs, podman fixes the following issues:\n\npodman was updated to 1.8.0:\n\n- CVE-2019-18466: Fixed a bug where podman cp would improperly copy files on the\n  host when copying a symlink in the container that included a\n  glob operator (#3829 bsc#1155217)\n\n- The name of the cni-bridge in the default config changed from\n  'cni0' to 'podman-cni0' with podman-1.6.0. Add a %trigger to\n  rename the bridge in the system to the new default if it exists.\n  The trigger is only excuted when updating podman-cni-config \n  from something older than 1.6.0. This is mainly needed for SLE\n  where we're updating from 1.4.4 to 1.8.0 (bsc#1160460).\n\nUpdate podman to v1.8.0 (bsc#1160460):\n\n* Features\n\n  - The podman system service command has been added, providing a\n    preview of Podman's new Docker-compatible API. This API is\n    still very new, and not yet ready for production use, but is\n    available for early testing\n  - Rootless Podman now uses Rootlesskit for port forwarding,\n    which should greatly improve performance and capabilities\n  - The podman untag command has been added to remove tags from\n    images without deleting them\n  - The podman inspect command on images now displays previous\n    names they used\n  - The podman generate systemd command now supports a --new\n    option to generate service files that create and run new\n    containers instead of managing existing containers\n  - Support for --log-opt tag= to set logging tags has been added\n    to the journald log driver\n  - Added support for using Seccomp profiles embedded in images\n    for podman run and podman create via the new --seccomp-policy\n      CLI flag\n  - The podman play kube command now honors pull policy\n\n* Bugfixes\n\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman cp command would not copy the\n    contents of directories when paths ending in /. were given\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not\n    properly locate Seccomp profiles specified relative to\n    localhost\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman info command for remote Podman\n    did not show registry information\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman exec command did not support\n    having input piped into it\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman cp command with rootless Podman\n    on CGroups v2 systems did not properly determine if the\n    container could be paused while copying\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman container prune --force command\n    could possible remove running containers if they were started\n    while the command was running \n  - Fixed a bug where Podman, when run as root, would not\n    properly configure slirp4netns networking when requested\n  - Fixed a bug where podman run --userns=keep-id did not work\n    when the user had a UID over 65535\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless podman run and podman create with\n    the --userns=keep-id option could change permissions on\n    /run/user/$UID and break KDE\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could not be run in a\n    systemd service on systems using CGroups v2\n  - Fixed a bug where podman inspect would show CPUShares as 0,\n    instead of the default (1024), when it was not explicitly set\n  - Fixed a bug where podman-remote push would segfault\n  - Fixed a bug where image healthchecks were not shown in the\n    output of podman inspect\n  - Fixed a bug where named volumes created with containers from\n    pre-1.6.3 releases of Podman would be autoremoved with their\n    containers if the --rm flag was given, even if they were\n    given names\n  - Fixed a bug where podman history was not computing image\n    sizes correctly\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman would not error on invalid values to\n    the --sort flag to podman images\n  - Fixed a bug where providing a name for the image made by\n    podman commit was mandatory, not optional as it should be\n  - Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client would append an\n    extra ' to %PATH\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman build command would sometimes\n    ignore the -f option and build the wrong Containerfile\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman ps --filter command would only\n    filter running containers, instead of all containers, if\n    --all was not passed\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman load command on compressed\n    images would leave an extra copy on disk\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman restart command would not\n    properly clean up the network, causing it to function\n    differently from podman stop; podman start\n  - Fixed a bug where setting the --memory-swap flag to podman\n    create and podman run to -1 (to indicate unlimited) was not\n    supported\n\n* Misc\n\n  - Initial work on version 2 of the Podman remote API has been\n    merged, but is still in an alpha state and not ready for use.\n    Read more here\n  - Many formatting corrections have been made to the manpages\n  - The changes to address (#5009) may cause anonymous volumes\n    created by Podman versions 1.6.3 to 1.7.0 to not be removed\n    when their container is removed\n  - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.13.1\n  - Updated vendored containers/storage to v1.15.8\n  - Updated vendored containers/image to v5.2.0\n\n- Add apparmor-abstractions as required runtime dependency to\n  have `tunables/global` available.\n\n- fixed the --force flag for the 'container prune' command.\n  (https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4844)\n\nUpdate podman to v1.7.0\n\n* Features\n\n  - Added support for setting a static MAC address for containers\n  - Added support for creating macvlan networks with podman\n    network create, allowing Podman containers to be attached\n    directly to networks the host is connected to\n  - The podman image prune and podman container prune commands\n    now support the --filter flag to filter what will be pruned,\n    and now prompts for confirmation when run without --force\n    (#4410 and #4411)\n  - Podman now creates CGroup namespaces by default on systems\n    using CGroups v2 (#4363)\n  - Added the podman system reset command to remove all Podman\n    files and perform a factory reset of the Podman installation\n  - Added the --history flag to podman images to display previous\n    names used by images (#4566)\n  - Added the --ignore flag to podman rm and podman stop to not\n    error when requested containers no longer exist\n  - Added the --cidfile flag to podman rm and podman stop to read\n    the IDs of containers to be removed or stopped from a file\n  - The podman play kube command now honors Seccomp annotations\n    (#3111)\n  - The podman play kube command now honors RunAsUser,\n    RunAsGroup, and selinuxOptions\n  - The output format of the podman version command has been\n    changed to better match docker version when using the\n    --format flag\n  - Rootless Podman will no longer initialize containers/storage\n    twice, removing a potential deadlock preventing Podman\n    commands from running while an image was being pulled (#4591)\n  - Added tmpcopyup and notmpcopyup options to the --tmpfs and\n    --mount type=tmpfs flags to podman create and podman run to\n    control whether the content of directories are copied into\n    tmpfs filesystems mounted over them\n  - Added support for disabling detaching from containers by\n    setting empty detach keys via --detach-keys=''\n  - The podman build command now supports the --pull and\n    --pull-never flags to control when images are pulled during a\n    build\n  - The podman ps -p command now shows the name of the pod as\n    well as its ID (#4703)\n  - The podman inspect command on containers will now display the\n    command used to create the container\n  - The podman info command now displays information on registry\n    mirrors (#4553)\n\n* Bugfixes\n\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman would use an incorrect runtime\n    directory as root, causing state to be deleted after root\n    logged out and making Podman in systemd services not function\n    properly\n  - Fixed a bug where the --change flag to podman import and\n    podman commit was not being parsed properly in many cases\n  - Fixed a bug where detach keys specified in libpod.conf were\n    not used by the podman attach and podman exec commands, which\n    always used the global default ctrl-p,ctrl-q key combination\n    (#4556)\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was not able to run podman\n    pod stats even on CGroups v2 enabled systems (#4634)\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would fail on kernels\n    without the renameat2 syscall (#4570)\n  - Fixed a bug where containers with chained network namespace\n    dependencies (IE, container A using --net container=B and\n    container B using --net container=C) would not properly mount\n    /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf into the container (#4626)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman run with the --rm flag and without\n    -d could, when run in the background, throw a 'container does\n    not exist' error when attempting to remove the container\n    after it exited\n  - Fixed a bug where named volume locks were not properly\n    reacquired after a reboot, potentially leading to deadlocks\n    when trying to start containers using the volume (#4605 and\n    #4621)\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman could not completely remove\n    containers if sent SIGKILL during removal, leaving the\n    container name unusable without the podman rm --storage\n    command to complete removal (#3906)\n  - Fixed a bug where checkpointing containers started with --rm\n    was allowed when --export was not specified (the container,\n    and checkpoint, would be removed after checkpointing was\n    complete by --rm) (#3774)\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman pod prune command would fail if\n    containers were present in the pods and the --force flag was\n    not passed (#4346)\n  - Fixed a bug where containers could not set a static IP or\n    static MAC address if they joined a non-default CNI network\n    (#4500)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman system renumber would always throw\n    an error if a container was mounted when it was run\n  - Fixed a bug where podman container restore would fail with\n    containers using a user namespace\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the\n    journald events backend even on systems without systemd\n    installed\n  - Fixed a bug where podman history would sometimes not properly\n    identify the IDs of layers in an image (#3359)\n  - Fixed a bug where containers could not be restarted when\n    Conmon v2.0.3 or later was used\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman did not check image OS and\n    Architecture against the host when starting a container\n  - Fixed a bug where containers in pods did not function\n    properly with the Kata OCI runtime (#4353)\n  - Fixed a bug where `podman info --format '{{ json . }}' would\n    not produce JSON output (#4391)\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman would not verify if files passed to\n    --authfile existed (#4328)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman images --digest would not always\n    print digests when they were available\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless podman run could hang due to a\n    race with reading and writing events\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would print warning-level\n    logs despite not be instructed to do so (#4456)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman pull would attempt to fetch from\n    remote registries when pulling an unqualified image using the\n    docker-daemon transport (#4434)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman cp would not work if STDIN was a\n    pipe\n  - Fixed a bug where podman exec could stop accepting input if\n    anything was typed between the command being run and the exec\n    session starting (#4397)\n  - Fixed a bug where podman logs --tail 0 would print all lines\n    of a container's logs, instead of no lines (#4396)\n  - Fixed a bug where the timeout for slirp4netns was incorrectly\n    set, resulting in an extremely long timeout (#4344)\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman stats command would print CPU\n    utilizations figures incorrectly (#4409)\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman inspect --size command would not\n    print the size of the container's read/write layer if the\n    size was 0 (#4744)\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman kill command was not properly\n    validating signals before use (#4746)\n  - Fixed a bug where the --quiet and --format flags to podman ps\n    could not be used at the same time\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman stop command was not stopping\n    exec sessions when a container was created without a PID\n    namespace (--pid=host)\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman pod rm --force command was not\n    removing anonymous volumes for containers that were removed\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman checkpoint command would not\n    export all changes to the root filesystem of the container if\n    performed more than once on the same container (#4606)\n  - Fixed a bug where containers started with --rm would not be\n    automatically removed on being stopped if an exec session was\n    running inside the container (#4666)\n\n* Misc\n\n  - The fixes to runtime directory path as root can cause strange\n    behavior if an upgrade is performed while containers are\n    running\n  - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.12.0\n  - Updated vendored containers/storage library to v1.15.4\n  - Updated vendored containers/image library to v5.1.0\n  - Kata Containers runtimes (kata-runtime, kata-qemu, and\n    kata-fc) are now present in the default libpod.conf, but will\n    not be available unless Kata containers is installed on the\n    system\n  - Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers\n    with a memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been\n    removed, as the crun runtime can create containers with\n    significantly less memory\n\nUpdate podman to v1.6.4\n- Remove winsz FIFO on container restart to allow use with Conmon 2.03 and higher\n- Ensure volumes reacquire locks on system restart, preventing deadlocks when starting containers\n- Suppress spurious log messages when running rootless Podman\n- Update vendored containers/storage to v1.13.6\n- Fix a deadlock related to writing events\n- Do not use the journald event logger when it is not available\n\nUpdate podman to v1.6.2\n\n* Features\n\n  - Added a --runtime flag to podman system migrate to allow the\n    OCI runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition\n    to the crun runtime on CGroups V2 systems until runc gains full\n    support\n  - The podman rm command can now remove containers in broken\n    states which previously could not be removed\n  - The podman info command, when run without root, now shows\n    information on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user\n    namespace\n  - Added podman build --squash-all flag, which squashes all layers\n    (including those of the base image) into one layer\n  - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create now accepts\n    a string argument and allows a new value, always, which forces\n    systemd support without checking if the the container\n    entrypoint is systemd\n\n* Bugfixes\n\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman top command did not work on\n    systems using CGroups V2 (#4192)\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file,\n    leading to a panic\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to retrieve some\n    containers while refreshing the state\n  - Fixed a bug where podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false would\n    still proxy signals into the container\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman would unconditionally use a\n    non-default path for authentication credentials (auth.json),\n    breaking podman login integration with skopeo and other tools\n    using the containers/image library\n  - Fixed a bug where podman ps --format=json and podman images\n    --format=json would display null when no results were returned,\n    instead of valid JSON\n  - Fixed a bug where podman build --squash was incorrectly\n    squashing all layers into one, instead of only new layers\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would allow volumes with\n    options to be mounted (mounting volumes requires root),\n    creating an inconsistent state where volumes reported as\n    mounted but were not (#4248)\n  - Fixed a bug where volumes which failed to unmount could not be\n    removed (#4247)\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman incorrectly handled some errors\n    relating to unmounted or missing containers in\n    containers/storage\n  - Fixed a bug where podman stats was broken on systems running\n    CGroups V2 when run rootless (#4268)\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman start command would print the\n    short container ID, instead of the full ID\n  - Fixed a bug where containers created with an OCI runtime that\n    is no longer available (uninstalled or removed from the config\n    file) would not appear in podman ps and could not be removed\n    via podman rm\n  - Fixed a bug where containers restored via podman container\n    restore --import would retain the CGroup path of the original\n    container, even if their container ID changed; thus, multiple\n    containers created from the same checkpoint would all share the\n    same CGroup\n\n* Misc\n\n  - The default PID limit for containers is now set to 4096. It can\n    be adjusted back to the old default (unlimited) by passing\n    --pids-limit 0 to podman create and podman run\n  - The podman start --attach command now automatically attaches\n    STDIN if the container was created with -i\n  - The podman network create command now validates network names\n    using the same regular expression as container and pod names\n  - The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create will now\n    only enable systemd mode when the binary being run inside the\n    container is /sbin/init, /usr/sbin/init, or ends in systemd\n    (previously detected any path ending in init or systemd)\n  - Updated vendored Buildah to 1.11.3\n  - Updated vendored containers/storage to 1.13.5\n  - Updated vendored containers/image to 4.0.1\n\nUpdate podman to v1.6.1\n\n* Features\n\n  - The podman network create, podman network rm, podman network\n    inspect, and podman network ls commands have been added to\n    manage CNI networks used by Podman\n  - The podman volume create command can now create and mount\n    volumes with options, allowing volumes backed by NFS, tmpfs,\n    and many other filesystems\n  - Podman can now run containers without CGroups for better\n    integration with systemd by using the --cgroups=disabled flag\n    with podman create and podman run. This is presently only\n    supported with the crun OCI runtime\n  - The podman volume rm and podman volume inspect commands can now\n    refer to volumes by an unambiguous partial name, in addition to\n    full name (e.g. podman volume rm myvol to remove a volume named\n    myvolume) (#3891)\n  - The podman run and podman create commands now support the\n    --pull flag to allow forced re-pulling of images (#3734)\n  - Mounting volumes into a container using --volume, --mount, and\n    --tmpfs now allows the suid, dev, and exec mount options (the\n    inverse of nosuid, nodev, noexec) (#3819)\n  - Mounting volumes into a container using --mount now allows the\n    relabel=Z and relabel=z options to relabel mounts.\n  - The podman push command now supports the --digestfile option to\n    save a file containing the pushed digest\n  - Pods can now have their hostname set via podman pod create\n    --hostname or providing Pod YAML with a hostname set to podman\n    play kube (#3732)\n  - The podman image sign command now supports the --cert-dir flag\n  -

Fixed a bug where podman build did not correctly inherit\n    Podman's CGroup configuration, causing crashed on CGroups V2\n    systems (#3938)\n  - Fixed a bug where remote podman run --rm would exit before the\n    container was completely removed, allowing race conditions when\n    removing container resources (#3870)\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not properly handle\n    changes to /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid after a container was\n    launched\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could not include some\n    devices in a container using the --device flag (#3905)\n  -

Significant changes were made to Podman volumes in this\n    release. If you have pre-existing volumes, it is strongly\n    recommended to run podman system renumber after upgrading.\n  - Version 0.8.1 or greater of the CNI Plugins is now required for\n    Podman\n  - Version 2.0.1 or greater of Conmon is strongly recommended\n  - Updated vendored Buildah to v1.11.2\n  - Updated vendored containers/storage library to v1.13.4\n  - Improved error messages when trying to create a pod with no\n    name via podman play kube\n  - Improved error messages when trying to run podman pause or\n    podman stats on a rootless container on a system without\n    CGroups V2 enabled\n  - TMPDIR has been set to /var/tmp by default to better handle\n    large temporary files\n  - podman wait has been optimized to detect stopped containers\n    more rapidly\n  - Podman containers now include a ContainerManager annotation\n    indicating they were created by libpod\n  - The podman info command now includes information about\n    slirp4netns and fuse-overlayfs if they are available\n  - Podman no longer sets a default size of 65kb for tmpfs\n    filesystems\n  - The default Podman CNI network has been renamed in an attempt\n    to prevent conflicts with CRI-O when both are run on the same\n    system.
