      "Text": "This update for python313 fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to version 3.13.11.\n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n\n- CVE-2025-12084: quadratic complexity when building nested elements using `xml.dom.minidom` methods that depend on\n  `_clear_id_cache()` can lead to availability issues when building excessively nested documents (bsc#1254997).\n- CVE-2025-13836: use of `Content-Length` by default when reading an HTTP response with no read amount specified can\n  lead to OOM issues and DoS when a client deals with a malicious server (bsc#1254400).\n- CVE-2025-13837: data read by the plistlib module according to the size specified by the file itself can lead to OOM\n  issues and DoS (bsc#1254401).\n\nOther updates and bugfixes:\n\n- Version 3.13.11:\n  * Library\n    - gh-140797: Revert changes to the undocumented re.Scanner\n      class. Capturing groups are still allowed for backward\n      compatibility, although using them can lead to incorrect\n      result. They will be forbidden in future Python versions.\n    - gh-142206: The resource tracker in the multiprocessing\n      module now uses the original communication protocol, as in\n      Python 3.14.0 and below, by default. This avoids issues\n      with upgrading Python while it is running. (Note that such\n      ‘in-place’ upgrades are not tested.) The tracker remains\n      compatible with subprocesses that use new protocol (that\n      is, subprocesses using Python 3.13.10, 3.14.1 and 3.15).\n  * Core and Builtins\n    - gh-142218: Fix crash when inserting into a split table\n      dictionary with a non str key that matches an existing key.\n  \n- Version to 3.13.10:\n  * Security\n    - gh-137836: Add support of the “plaintext” element, RAWTEXT\n      elements “xmp”, “iframe”, “noembed” and “noframes”, and\n      optionally RAWTEXT element “noscript” in\n      html.parser.HTMLParser.\n    - gh-136063: email.message: ensure linear complexity for\n      legacy HTTP parameters parsing. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n  * Library\n    - gh-74389: When the stdin being used by a subprocess.Popen\n      instance is closed, this is now ignored in\n      subprocess.Popen.communicate() instead of leaving the class\n      in an inconsistent state.\n    - gh-87512: Fix subprocess.Popen.communicate() timeout\n      handling on Windows when writing large input. Previously,\n      the timeout was ignored during stdin writing, causing the\n      method to block indefinitely if the child process did not\n      consume input quickly. The stdin write is now performed in\n      a background thread, allowing the timeout to be properly\n      enforced.\n    - gh-141473: When subprocess.Popen.communicate() was called\n      with input and a timeout and is called for a second time\n      after a TimeoutExpired exception before the process has\n      died, it should no longer hang.\n    - gh-59000: Fix pdb breakpoint resolution for class methods\n      when the module defining the class is not imported.\n    - gh-141570: Support file-like object raising OSError from\n      fileno() in color detection (_colorize.can_colorize()).\n      This can occur when sys.stdout is redirected.\n    - gh-141659: Fix bad file descriptor errors from\n      _posixsubprocess on AIX.\n    - gh-141497: ipaddress: ensure that the methods\n      IPv4Network.hosts() and IPv6Network.hosts() always return\n      an iterator.\n    - gh-140938: The statistics.stdev() and statistics.pstdev()\n      functions now raise a ValueError when the input contains an\n      infinity or a NaN.\n    - gh-124111: Updated Tcl threading configuration in _tkinter\n      to assume that threads are always available in Tcl 9 and\n      later.\n    - gh-137109: The os.fork and related forking APIs will no\n      longer warn in the common case where Linux or macOS\n      platform APIs return the number of threads in a process and\n      find the answer to be 1 even when a os.register_at_fork()\n      after_in_parent= callback (re)starts a thread.\n    - gh-141314: Fix assertion failure in io.TextIOWrapper.tell()\n      when reading files with standalone carriage return (\\r)\n      line endings.\n    - gh-141311: Fix assertion failure in io.BytesIO.readinto()\n      and undefined behavior arising when read position is above\n      capcity in io.BytesIO.\n    - gh-141141: Fix a thread safety issue with\n      base64.b85decode(). Contributed by Benel Tayar.\n    - gh-140911: collections: Ensure that the methods\n      UserString.rindex() and UserString.index() accept\n      collections.UserString instances as the sub argument.\n    - gh-140797: The undocumented re.Scanner class now forbids\n      regular expressions containing capturing groups in its\n      lexicon patterns. Patterns using capturing groups could\n      previously lead to crashes with segmentation fault. Use\n      non-capturing groups (?:…) instead.\n    - gh-140815: faulthandler now detects if a frame or a code\n      object is invalid or freed. Patch by Victor Stinner.\n    - gh-100218: Correctly set errno when socket.if_nametoindex()\n      or socket.if_indextoname() raise an OSError. Patch by\n      Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-140875: Fix handling of unclosed character references\n      (named and numerical) followed by the end of file in\n      html.parser.HTMLParser with convert_charrefs=False.\n    - gh-140734: multiprocessing: fix off-by-one error when\n      checking the length of a temporary socket file path. Patch\n      by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-140874: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to\n      version 25.3\n    - gh-140691: In urllib.request, when opening a FTP URL fails\n      because a data connection cannot be made, the control\n      connection’s socket is now closed to avoid\n      a ResourceWarning.\n    - gh-103847: Fix hang when cancelling process created by\n      asyncio.create_subprocess_exec() or\n      asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(). Patch by Kumar Aditya.\n    - gh-140590: Fix arguments checking for the\n      functools.partial.__setstate__() that may lead to internal\n      state corruption and crash. Patch by Sergey Miryanov.\n    - gh-140634: Fix a reference counting bug in\n      os.sched_param.__reduce__().\n    - gh-140633: Ignore AttributeError when setting a module’s\n      __file__ attribute when loading an extension module\n      packaged as Apple Framework.\n    - gh-140593: xml.parsers.expat: Fix a memory leak that could\n      affect users with ElementDeclHandler() set to a custom\n      element declaration handler. Patch by Sebastian Pipping.\n    - gh-140607: Inside io.RawIOBase.read(), validate that the\n      count of bytes returned by io.RawIOBase.readinto() is valid\n      (inside the provided buffer).\n    - gh-138162: Fix logging.LoggerAdapter with merge_extra=True\n      and without the extra argument.\n    - gh-140474: Fix memory leak in array.array when creating\n      arrays from an empty str and the u type code.\n    - gh-140272: Fix memory leak in the clear() method of the\n      dbm.gnu database.\n    - gh-140041: Fix import of ctypes on Android and Cygwin when\n      ABI flags are present.\n    - gh-139905: Add suggestion to error message for\n      typing.Generic subclasses when cls.__parameters__ is\n      missing due to a parent class failing to call\n      super().__init_subclass__() in its __init_subclass__.\n    - gh-139845: Fix to not print KeyboardInterrupt twice in\n      default asyncio REPL.\n    - gh-139783: Fix inspect.getsourcelines() for the case when\n      a decorator is followed by a comment or an empty line.\n    - gh-70765: http.server: fix default handling of HTTP/0.9\n      requests in BaseHTTPRequestHandler. Previously,\n      BaseHTTPRequestHandler.parse_request() incorrectly waited\n      for headers in the request although those are not supported\n      in HTTP/0.9. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-139391: Fix an issue when, on non-Windows platforms, it\n      was not possible to gracefully exit a python -m asyncio\n      process suspended by Ctrl+Z and later resumed by fg other\n      than with kill.\n    - gh-101828: Fix 'shift_jisx0213', 'shift_jis_2004',\n      'euc_jisx0213' and 'euc_jis_2004' codecs truncating null\n      chars as they were treated as part of multi-character\n      sequences.\n    - gh-139246: fix: paste zero-width in default repl width is\n      wrong.\n    - gh-90949: Add SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold() and\n      SetAllocTrackerMaximumAmplification() to xmlparser objects\n      to prevent use of disproportional amounts of dynamic memory\n      from within an Expat parser. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-139065: Fix trailing space before a wrapped long word if\n      the line length is exactly width in textwrap.\n    - gh-138993: Dedent credits text.\n    - gh-138859: Fix generic type parameterization raising\n      a TypeError when omitting a ParamSpec that has a default\n      which is not a list of types.\n    - gh-138775: Use of python -m with base64 has been fixed to\n      detect input from a terminal so that it properly notices\n      EOF.\n    - gh-98896: Fix a failure in multiprocessing resource_tracker\n      when SharedMemory names contain colons. Patch by Rani\n      Pinchuk.\n    - gh-75989: tarfile.TarFile.extractall() and\n      tarfile.TarFile.extract() now overwrite symlinks when\n      extracting hardlinks.
