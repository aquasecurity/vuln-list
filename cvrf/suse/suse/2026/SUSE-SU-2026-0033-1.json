      "CVE": "CVE-2022-50280",
      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npnode: terminate at peers of source\n\nThe propagate_mnt() function handles mount propagation when creating\nmounts and propagates the source mount tree @source_mnt to all\napplicable nodes of the destination propagation mount tree headed by\n@dest_mnt.\n\nUnfortunately it contains a bug where it fails to terminate at peers of\n@source_mnt when looking up copies of the source mount that become\nmasters for copies of the source mount tree mounted on top of slaves in\nthe destination propagation tree causing a NULL dereference.\n\nOnce the mechanics of the bug are understood it's easy to trigger.\nBecause of unprivileged user namespaces it is available to unprivileged\nusers.\n\nWhile fixing this bug we've gotten confused multiple times due to\nunclear terminology or missing concepts. So let's start this with some\nclarifications:\n\n* The terms \"master\" or \"peer\" denote a shared mount. A shared mount\n  belongs to a peer group.\n\n* A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.\n  They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available\n  in @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_group_id.\n  Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.\n  The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_share.\n\n* The terms \"slave mount\" or \"dependent mount\" denote a mount that\n  receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts\n  may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their\n  master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on\n  that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_slave_list.\n\n* The term \"master mount\" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it\n  denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term\n  \"master mount\" - or \"master\" for short - is mostly used when talking\n  in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master\n  mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a\n  slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can\n  be identified via @slave_mount-\u003emnt_master. Different slaves may point\n  to different masters in the same peer group.\n\n* Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty -\u003emnt_slave_lists.\n  Non-empty -\u003emnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to\n  ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the\n  -\u003emnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.\n\n* Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive\n  propagation from via @slave_mnt-\u003emnt_master (see above). Together with\n  these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest\n  peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id\n  @slave_mnt-\u003emnt_master-\u003emnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave\n  mount receives propagation from.\n\n* A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also\n  a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive\n  propagation from another peer group.\n\n  If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all\n  peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via\n  -\u003emnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same\n  -\u003emnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.\n\n* A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group\n  but is not a peer in another peer group.\n\n* A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single\n  peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point\n  to a peer in that peer group via -\u003emnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts\n  such that @slave_mnt-\u003emnt_master-\u003emnt_group_id is equal to\n  @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_group_id.\n\n  The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a\n  single propagation level in a propagation tree.\n\n  For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and\n  all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group pr\n---truncated---",

This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n\u0026 operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: rust bindgen wasn't able to handle BIT(), from Miguel]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuio_hv_generic: Let userspace take care of interrupt mask\n\nRemove the logic to set interrupt mask by default in uio_hv_generic\ndriver as the interrupt mask value is supposed to be controlled\ncompletely by the user space. If the mask bit gets changed\nby the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,\nthe mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the\nuser-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.\n\nFor eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,\nthe host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.\nHowever, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a\nmessage in the inbound ring buffer.  So let's assume that happens,\nthe host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.\n\nSubsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring\nbuffer interrupt mask to 0, saying \"Hey, I'm ready for interrupts\".\nUser space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.\nThen one of two things happens:\n\n* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.\n* The host does send another message. But because there's already a\n  message in the ring buffer, it doesn't generate an interrupt.\n  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an\n  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to\n  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not\n  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.\n  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from\n  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.\n\nThis could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay\nsetting interrupt mask to 0.\n\nSimilarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,\nthere's a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring\nbuffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could\nput another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn't interrupt.\nThen the next pread() would hang.\n\nFix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,\nwhile keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace\ncontrol the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.",
