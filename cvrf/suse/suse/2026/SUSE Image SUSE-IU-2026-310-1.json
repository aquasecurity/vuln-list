The backported fixes do not contain changes for\n  ntpath.py and related tests, because the support for symlinks\n  and junctions were added later in Python 3.9, and it does not\n  make sense to backport them to 3.6 here. The patch is contains\n  the following changes:\n  - python@42deeab fixes symlink handling for tarfile.data_filter\n  - python@9d2c2a8 fixes handling of existing files/symlinks in\n    tarfile\n  - python@00af979 adds a new \u0026quot;strict\u0026quot; argument to realpath()\n  - python@dd8f187 fixes mulriple CVE fixes in the tarfile module\n  - downstream only fixes that makes the changes work and\n    compatible with Python 3.6\n- Readjust CVE-2025-8194-tarfile-no-neg-offsets.patch on the top\n  of the previous two patches\n- Add remove-usr-local-bin-shebangs.patch for removing two\n  shebangs with /usr/local/bin/python (with the complexity of the\n  current patchset fiddling with the files with `sed` makes those\n  patches unmaintainable).\n\n- Finally ported CVE-2007-4559-filter-tarfile_extractall.patch\n  for Python 3.4 (CVE-2007-4559, bsc#1203750, bsc#1251841).\n\n- Add CVE-2025-13836-http-resp-cont-len.patch (bsc#1254400,\n  CVE-2025-13836) to prevent reading an HTTP response from\n  a server, if no read amount is specified, with using\n  Content-Length per default as the length.\n- Add CVE-2025-12084-minidom-quad-search.patch prevent quadratic\n  behavior in node ID cache clearing (CVE-2025-12084,\n  bsc#1254997).\n- Add CVE-2025-13837-plistlib-mailicious-length.patch protect\n  against OOM when loading malicious content (CVE-2025-13837,\n  bsc#1254401).\n\n- Fix the build system with two patches:\n  - spc-tab-Makefile-pre-in.patch there are space-indended lines\n    in the Makefile.pre.in in tarball (!!!), fix that\n  - Modules_Setup.patch, Modules/makesetup script is kind of\n    broken (gh#python/cpython!4338 among others)\n  - time-static.patch make time module statically built into the\n    interpreter\n- Add s390-build.patch to skip failing test on s390.\n\n- Add CVE-2025-6075-expandvars-perf-degrad.patch avoid simple\n  quadratic complexity vulnerabilities of os.path.expandvars()\n  (CVE-2025-6075, bsc#1252974).\n- Add also two small patches:\n  - lchmod-non-support.patch adding @requires_lchmod operator\n    for skipping tests on platforms were changing the mode of\n    symbolic links is supported (which it isnât in SLE-12,\n    apparently).\n  - locale-test_float_with_commad.patch for decoding byte strings\n    in localeconv() for consistent output\n- Update pip wheel to pip-20.2.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl.\n\n- Add CVE-2025-8291-consistency-zip64.patch which checks\n  consistency of the zip64 end of central directory record, and\n  preventing obfuscation of the payload, i.e., you scanning for\n  malicious content in a ZIP file with one ZIP parser (let's say\n  a Rust one) then unpack it in production with another (e.g.,\n  the Python one) and get malicious content that the other parser\n  did not see (CVE-2025-8291, bsc#1251305)\n- Readjust patches while synchronizing between openSUSE and SLE trees:\n  - 99366-patch.dict-can-decorate-async.patch\n  - CVE-2007-4559-filter-tarfile_extractall.patch\n  - CVE-2020-10735-DoS-no-limit-int-size.patch\n  - CVE-2024-6232-ReDOS-backtrack-tarfile.patch\n  - CVE-2025-4435-normalize-lnk-trgts-tarfile.patch\n  - CVE-2025-8194-tarfile-no-neg-offsets.patch\n  - python-3.6.0-multilib-new.patch\n  - python3-sorted_tar.patch\n\nPackage curl was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1256105, CVE-2025-14017]  * call ldap_init() before setting the options\n  * Add patch curl-CVE-2025-14017.patch\n\n- Security fixes:\n  * [bsc#1255731, CVE-2025-14524] bearer token leak on cross-protocol redirect\n  * [bsc#1255733, CVE-2025-15079] set both knownhosts options to the same file\n  * [bsc#1255732, CVE-2025-14819] toggling CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN makes a different CA cache\n  * Add patches:\n  - curl-CVE-2025-14524.patch\n  - curl-CVE-2025-15079.patch\n  - curl-CVE-2025-14819.patch\n\nPackage pciutils was updated:\n\n- pciutils.spec: Add a strict dependency to libpci. [bsc#1252338]  Mixing different versions of pciutils and libpci could result in\n  a segmentation fault due to incompatible ABI.\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Add bmo1990242.patch to move NSS DB password hash away from SHA-1\n- update to NSS 3.112.2\n  * bmo#1970079 - Prevent leaks during pkcs12 decoding.\n  * bmo#1988046 - SEC_ASN1Decode* should ensure it has read as many bytes as each length field indicates\n- Adding patch bmo1980465.patch to fix bug on s390x (bmo#1980465)\n- Adding patch bmo1956754.patch to fix possible undefined behaviour (bmo#1956754)\n\n- update to NSS 3.112.1\n  * bmo#1982742 - restore support for finding certificates by decoded serial number.\n\nPackage docker was updated:\n\n- Enable SELinux in default daemon.json config (--selinux-enabled).

NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the specification and is passed forward to handlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npnode: terminate at peers of source\n\nThe propagate_mnt() function handles mount propagation when creating\nmounts and propagates the source mount tree @source_mnt to all\napplicable nodes of the destination propagation mount tree headed by\n@dest_mnt.\n\nUnfortunately it contains a bug where it fails to terminate at peers of\n@source_mnt when looking up copies of the source mount that become\nmasters for copies of the source mount tree mounted on top of slaves in\nthe destination propagation tree causing a NULL dereference.\n\nOnce the mechanics of the bug are understood it's easy to trigger.\nBecause of unprivileged user namespaces it is available to unprivileged\nusers.\n\nWhile fixing this bug we've gotten confused multiple times due to\nunclear terminology or missing concepts. So let's start this with some\nclarifications:\n\n* The terms \"master\" or \"peer\" denote a shared mount. A shared mount\n  belongs to a peer group.\n\n* A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.\n  They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available\n  in @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_group_id.\n  Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.\n  The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_share.\n\n* The terms \"slave mount\" or \"dependent mount\" denote a mount that\n  receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts\n  may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their\n  master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on\n  that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_slave_list.\n\n* The term \"master mount\" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it\n  denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term\n  \"master mount\" - or \"master\" for short - is mostly used when talking\n  in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master\n  mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a\n  slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can\n  be identified via @slave_mount-\u003emnt_master. Different slaves may point\n  to different masters in the same peer group.\n\n* Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty -\u003emnt_slave_lists.\n  Non-empty -\u003emnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to\n  ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the\n  -\u003emnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.\n\n* Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive\n  propagation from via @slave_mnt-\u003emnt_master (see above). Together with\n  these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest\n  peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id\n  @slave_mnt-\u003emnt_master-\u003emnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave\n  mount receives propagation from.\n\n* A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also\n  a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive\n  propagation from another peer group.\n\n  If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all\n  peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via\n  -\u003emnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same\n  -\u003emnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.\n\n* A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group\n  but is not a peer in another peer group.\n\n* A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single\n  peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point\n  to a peer in that peer group via -\u003emnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts\n  such that @slave_mnt-\u003emnt_master-\u003emnt_group_id is equal to\n  @shared_mnt-\u003emnt_group_id.\n\n  The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a\n  single propagation level in a propagation tree.\n\n  For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and\n  all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group pr\n---truncated---",

An openvswitch instance with one bridge and default flows\n2. two network namespaces \"server\" and \"client\"\n3. two ovs interfaces \"server\" and \"client\" on the bridge\n4. for each ovs interface a veth pair with a matching name and 32 rx and\n   tx queues\n5. move the ends of the veth pairs to the respective network namespaces\n6. assign ip addresses to each of the veth ends in the namespaces (needs\n   to be the same subnet)\n7. start some http server on the server network namespace\n8. test if a client in the client namespace can reach the http server\n\nwhen following the actions below the host has a chance of getting a cpu\nstuck in a infinite loop:\n1. send a large amount of parallel requests to the http server (around\n   3000 curls should work)\n2. in parallel delete the network namespace (do not delete interfaces or\n   stop the server, just kill the namespace)\n\nthere is a low chance that this will cause the below kernel cpu stuck\nmessage. If this does not happen just retry.\nBelow there is also the output of bpftrace for the functions mentioned\nin the output.\n\nThe series of events happening here is:\n1. the network namespace is deleted calling\n   `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` somewhere in the process\n2. this sets first `NETREG_UNREGISTERING` on both ends of the veth and\n   then runs `synchronize_net`\n3. it then calls `call_netdevice_notifiers` with `NETDEV_UNREGISTER`\n4. this is then handled by `dp_device_event` which calls\n   `ovs_netdev_detach_dev` (if a vport is found, which is the case for\n   the veth interface attached to ovs)\n5. this removes the rx_handlers of the device but does not prevent\n   packages to be sent to the device\n6. `dp_device_event` then queues the vport deletion to work in\n   background as a ovs_lock is needed that we do not hold in the\n   unregistration path\n7. `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` continues to call\n   `netdev_unregister_kobject` which sets `real_num_tx_queues` to 0\n8. port deletion continues (but details are not relevant for this issue)\n9. at some future point the background task deletes the vport\n\nIf after 7. but before 9. a packet is send to the ovs vport (which is\nnot deleted at this point in time) which forwards it to the\n`dev_queue_xmit` flow even though the device is unregistering.\nIn `skb_tx_hash` (which is called in the `dev_queue_xmit`) path there is\na while loop (if the packet has a rx_queue recorded) that is infinite if\n`dev-\u003ereal_num_tx_queues` is zero.\n\nTo prevent this from happening we update `do_output` to handle devices\nwithout carrier the same as if the device is not found (which would\nbe the code path after 9. is done).\n\nAdditionally we now produce a warning in `skb_tx_hash` if we will hit\nthe infinite loop.\n\nbpftrace (first word is function name):\n\n__dev_queue_xmit server: real_num_tx_queues: 1, cpu: 2, pid: 28024, tid: 28024, skb_addr: 0xffff9edb6f207000, reg_state: 1\nnetdev_core_pick_tx server: addr: 0xffff9f0a46d4a000 real_num_tx_queues: 1, cpu: 2, pid: 28024, tid: 28024, skb_addr: 0xffff9edb6f207000, reg_state: 1\ndp_device_event server: real_num_tx_queues: 1 cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024, event 2, reg_state: 1\nsynchronize_rcu_expedited: cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024\nsynchronize_rcu_expedited: cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024\nsynchronize_rcu_expedited: cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024\nsynchronize_rcu_expedited: cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024\ndp_device_event server: real_num_tx_queues: 1 cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024, event 6, reg_state: 2\novs_netdev_detach_dev server: real_num_tx_queues: 1 cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024, reg_state: 2\nnetdev_rx_handler_unregister server: real_num_tx_queues: 1, cpu: 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024, reg_state: 2\nsynchronize_rcu_expedited: cpu 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024\nnetdev_rx_handler_unregister ret server: real_num_tx_queues: 1, cpu: 9, pid: 21024, tid: 21024, reg_state: 2\ndp_\n---truncated---",

For this bug, jbd2_journal_restart() is\ncalled by ocfs2_split_extent() during defragmenting.\n\nHow to fix\n\nFor ocfs2_split_extent() can handle journal operations totally by itself. \nCaller doesn't need to call journal access/dirty pair, and caller only\nneeds to call journal start/stop pair.  The fix method is to remove\njournal access/dirty from __ocfs2_move_extent().\n\nThe discussion for this patch:\nhttps://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/ocfs2-devel/2023-February/000647.html",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX\n\nWhen sysctl_nr_open is set to a very high value (for example, 1073741816\nas set by systemd), processes attempting to use file descriptors near\nthe limit can trigger massive memory allocation attempts that exceed\nINT_MAX, resulting in a WARNING in mm/slub.c:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 44 at mm/slub.c:5027 __kvmalloc_node_noprof+0x21a/0x288\n\nThis happens because kvmalloc_array() and kvmalloc() check if the\nrequested size exceeds INT_MAX and emit a warning when the allocation is\nnot flagged with __GFP_NOWARN.\n\nSpecifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a\nprocess calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate:\n- File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes\n- Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB\n- Total allocation size: \u003e 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647)\n\nReproducer:\n1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816:\n   # echo 1073741816 \u003e /proc/sys/fs/nr_open\n\n2. Run a program that uses a high file descriptor:\n   #include \u003cunistd.h\u003e\n   #include \u003csys/resource.h\u003e\n\n   int main() {\n       struct rlimit rlim = {1073741824, 1073741824};\n       setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, \u0026rlim);\n       dup2(2, 1073741880);  // Triggers the warning\n       return 0;\n   }\n\n3. Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027\n\nsystemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the\nmaximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory\ncontrol groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits\nsince memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked\nthat:\n\n1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum\n   size regardless of memcg accounting\n2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can\n   inadvertently trigger massive allocations\n3. The resulting allocations (\u003e8GB) are impractical and will always fail\n\nsystemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value\nuntil the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open\nbeing set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file\ndescriptors.\n\nWhile processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal\noperation, certain selftests (like\ntools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file\ndescriptor limits can trigger this issue.\n\nFix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested\nallocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to\nfail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the\nimpractical \u003e8GB memory allocation request.",

Unfortunately, the lack of proper\nerror handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,\ncausing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].\n\nAvoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DT\nproperties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTs\nupstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,\nclearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in the\nkernel log was just ignored. It's safer to disable the crypto engine for\nthese broken DTBs.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CY01EKQVWE36.B9X5TDXAREPF@fairphone.com/\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230626145959.646747-1-krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org/",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncnic: Fix use-after-free bugs in cnic_delete_task\n\nThe original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw(),\nwhich does not guarantee that the delayed work item 'delete_task' has\nfully completed if it was already running. Additionally, the delayed work\nitem is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only\nblocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the\nworkqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after\nflush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the\nflush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have\nfinished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.\nThis leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated\nby cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to\ndereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\ncnic_netdev_event()          |\n  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()\n    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...\n      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()\n      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/\n                             | queue_delayed_work()\n  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance\n                             |   dev = cp-\u003edev; //use\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any\nongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is\ndeallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses\n__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently\nexecuting instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()\nbecomes redundant and should be removed.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue\nand validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and\nintroduced intentional delays - such as inserting calls to ssleep()\nwithin the cnic_delete_task() function - to increase the likelihood\nof triggering the bug.",

This setup causes the following mishap during the \u0026=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the \u0026 operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n\u0026 operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: rust bindgen wasn't able to handle BIT(), from Miguel]",

If the mask bit gets changed\nby the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,\nthe mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the\nuser-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.\n\nFor eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,\nthe host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.\nHowever, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a\nmessage in the inbound ring buffer.  So let's assume that happens,\nthe host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.\n\nSubsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring\nbuffer interrupt mask to 0, saying \"Hey, I'm ready for interrupts\".\nUser space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.\nThen one of two things happens:\n\n* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.\n* The host does send another message. But because there's already a\n  message in the ring buffer, it doesn't generate an interrupt.\n  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an\n  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to\n  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not\n  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.\n  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from\n  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.\n\nThis could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay\nsetting interrupt mask to 0.\n\nSimilarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,\nthere's a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring\nbuffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could\nput another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn't interrupt.\nThen the next pread() would hang.\n\nFix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,\nwhile keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace\ncontrol the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.",

This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively).

This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts.
