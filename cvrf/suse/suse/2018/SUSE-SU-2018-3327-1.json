(bsc#1108637)\n- CVE-2018-17101: There are two out-of-bounds writes in cpTags in tools/tiff2bw.c and tools/pal2rgb.c, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file. (bsc#1108627)\n- CVE-2018-17795: The function t2p_write_pdf in tiff2pdf.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9935.
