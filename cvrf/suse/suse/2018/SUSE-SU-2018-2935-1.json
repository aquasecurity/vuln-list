      "Text": "This update for the Linux Kernel 4.12.14-25_13 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-10938: It was found that a crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading to a denial-of-service. A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel should be set up on a system an attacker could leverage this flaw (bsc#1106191).\n- CVE-2018-15471: It was found that the netback driver allowed frontends to control mapping of requests to request queues. When processing a request to set or change this mapping, some input validation (e.g., for an integer overflow) was missing or flawed, leading to OOB access in hash handling. A malicious or buggy frontend may caused the (usually privileged) backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in one or more of privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), or information leaks (bsc#1105026).\n- CVE-2018-10853: It was found that the KVM hypervisor emulated instructions did not check current privilege(CPL) level while emulating unprivileged instructions. An unprivileged guest user/process could use this flaw to potentially escalate privileges inside guest (bsc#1097108).\n",
