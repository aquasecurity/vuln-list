      "Text": "This update for java-1_8_0-ibm to 8.0.5.20 fixes the following security issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-2952: Vulnerability in subcomponent: Concurrency. Difficult to\n  exploit vulnerability allowed unauthenticated attacker with network access via\n  multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful\n  attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a\n  partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit\n  (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2018-2940: Vulnerability in subcomponent: Libraries. Easily exploitable\n  vulnerability allowed unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple\n  protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require\n  human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of\n  this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java\n  SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2018-2973: Vulnerability in subcomponent: JSSE. Difficult to exploit\n  vulnerability allowed unauthenticated attacker with network access via SSL/TLS\n  to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification\n  access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data\n  (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2018-2964: Vulnerability in subcomponent: Deployment. Difficult to\n  exploit vulnerability allowed unauthenticated attacker with network access via\n  multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human\n  interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2016-0705: Prevent double free in the dsa_priv_decode function that\n  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or\n  possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed DSA private key\n  (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2017-3732: Prevent carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery\n  squaring procedure (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2017-3736: Prevent carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery\n  squaring procedure (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2018-1517: Unspecified vulnerability (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2018-1656: Unspecified vulnerability (bsc#1104668)\n- CVE-2018-12539: Users other than the process owner might have been able to\n  use Java Attach API to connect to an IBM JVM on the same machine and use Attach\n  API operations, which includes the ability to execute untrusted native code\n  (bsc#1104668)\n\n",

Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites. Note: This issue is very similar to CVE-2015-3193 but must be treated as a separate problem.",
