      "Text": "This update for quagga fixes the following security issues:\n\n- The Quagga BGP daemon contained a bug in the AS_PATH size calculation that\n  could have been exploited to facilitate a remote denial-of-service attack via\n  specially crafted BGP UPDATE messages. [CVE-2017-16227, bsc#1065641]\n\n- The Quagga BGP daemon did not check whether data sent to peers via NOTIFY had\n  an invalid attribute length. It was possible to exploit this issue and cause\n  the bgpd process to leak sensitive information over the network to a\n  configured peer. [CVE-2018-5378, bsc#1079798]\n\n- The Quagga BGP daemon used to double-free memory when processing certain\n  forms of UPDATE messages. This issue could be exploited by sending an\n  optional/transitive UPDATE attribute that all conforming eBGP speakers should\n  pass along. Consequently, a single UPDATE message could have affected many\n  bgpd processes across a wide area of a network. Through this vulnerability,\n  attackers could potentially have taken over control of affected bgpd\n  processes remotely. [CVE-2018-5379, bsc#1079799]\n\n- It was possible to overrun internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables in\n  the Quagga BGP daemon. Configured peers could have exploited this issue and\n  cause bgpd to emit debug and warning messages into the logs that would\n  contained arbitrary bytes. [CVE-2018-5380, bsc#1079800]\n\n- The Quagga BGP daemon could have entered an infinite loop if sent an invalid\n  OPEN message by a configured peer. If this issue was exploited, then bgpd\n  would cease to respond to any other events. BGP sessions would have been\n  dropped and not be reestablished. The CLI interface would have been\n  unresponsive. The bgpd daemon would have stayed in this state until\n  restarted. [CVE-2018-5381, bsc#1079801]\n\n- The Quagga daemon's telnet 'vty' CLI contains an unbounded memory allocation\n  bug that could be exploited for a denial-of-service attack on the daemon.\n  This issue has been fixed. [CVE-2017-5495, bsc#1021669]\n\n- The telnet 'vty' CLI of the Quagga daemon is no longer enabled by default,\n  because the passwords in the default 'zebra.conf' config file are now\n  disabled. The vty interface is available via 'vtysh' utility using pam\n  authentication to permit management access for root without password.\n  [bsc#1021669]\n",

      "Description": "All versions of Quagga, 0.93 through 1.1.0, are vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation in the telnet 'vty' CLI, leading to a Denial-of-Service of Quagga daemons, or even the entire host. When Quagga daemons are configured with their telnet CLI enabled, anyone who can connect to the TCP ports can trigger this vulnerability, prior to authentication. Most distributions restrict the Quagga telnet interface to local access only by default. The Quagga telnet interface 'vty' input buffer grows automatically, without bound, so long as a newline is not entered. This allows an attacker to cause the Quagga daemon to allocate unbounded memory by sending very long strings without a newline. Eventually the daemon is terminated by the system, or the system itself runs out of memory. This is fixed in Quagga 1.1.1 and Free Range Routing (FRR) Protocol Suite 2017-01-10.",
