Due to insufficient validation of administrator-supplied\n  configuration settings via the HTTP API, it was possible for a CouchDB\n  administrator user to escalate their privileges to that of the operating\n  system's user that CouchDB runs under, by bypassing the blacklist of\n  configuration settings that are not allowed to be modified via the HTTP API\n  (bsc#1100973).\n- CVE-2017-12636: CouchDB administrative users can configure the database\n  server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for\n  operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This\n  allowed an admin user in Apache CouchDB to execute arbitrary shell commands as\n  the CouchDB user (bsc#1068386).\n",
