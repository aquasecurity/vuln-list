A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel should be set up on a system an attacker could leverage this flaw.\n- CVE-2018-10902: It was found that the raw midi kernel driver did not protect against concurrent access which lead to a double realloc (double free) in snd_rawmidi_input_params() and snd_rawmidi_output_status(), allowing a malicious local attacker to use this for privilege escalation (bsc#1105323).\n",
