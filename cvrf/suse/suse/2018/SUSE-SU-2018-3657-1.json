A specially crafted ILBM image can cause a heap overflow resulting in code execution. (bsc#1084256).\n- CVE-2017-14440: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ILBM image rendering functionality. A specially crafted ILBM image can cause a stack overflow resulting in code execution. (bsc#1084257).\n- CVE-2017-14448: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image rendering functionality. A specially crafted XCF image can cause a heap overflow resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability. (bsc#1084303).\n- CVE-2018-3839: An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image rendering functionality.
