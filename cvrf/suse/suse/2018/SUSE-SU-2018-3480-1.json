      "Text": "This update for wpa_supplicant provides the following fixes:\n\nThis security issues was fixe:\n\n- CVE-2018-14526: Under certain conditions, the integrity of EAPOL-Key messages was not checked, leading to a decryption oracle. An attacker within range of the Access Point and client could have abused the vulnerability to recover sensitive information (bsc#1104205)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Fix reading private key passwords from the configuration file. (bsc#1099835)\n- Enable PWD as EAP method. This allows for password-based authentication, which is easier\n  to setup than most of the other methods, and is used by the Eduroam network. (bsc#1109209)\n- compile eapol_test binary to allow testing via radius proxy and server (note: this does not match CONFIG_EAPOL_TEST which sets -Werror and activates an assert call inside the code of wpa_supplicant) (bsc#1111873), (fate#326725)\n- Enabled timestamps in log file when being invoked by systemd service file (bsc#1080798).\n- Fixes the default file permissions of the debug log file to more sane values, i.e. it is no longer world-readable (bsc#1098854).\n- Open the debug log file with O_CLOEXEC, which will prevent file descriptor leaking to child processes (bsc#1098854).\n",
