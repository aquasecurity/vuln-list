rpm/kernel-binary.spec.in: Ignore return code from ksymtypes compare\n  When using suse-kabi-tools, the RPM build invokes 'ksymvers compare' to\n  compare the resulting symbol CRCs with the reference data. If the values\n  differ, it then invokes 'ksymtypes compare' to provide a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols differ. The build expects the latter\n  'ksymtypes compare' command to always return zero, even if the two\n  compared kABI corpuses are different.\n  This is currently the case for 'ksymtypes compare'. However, I plan to\n  update the command to return a non-zero code when the comparison detects\n  any differences. This should ensure consistent behavior with 'ksymvers\n  compare'.\n  Since the build uses 'ksymtypes compare' only for more detailed\n  diagnostics, ignore its return code.\n- commit 5ac1381\n\n-

During this operation, genksyms\n  is invoked for each source file. The tool determines type signatures of\n  all exports within the file, reports any differences compared to the\n  associated symref reference, calculates symbol CRCs from the signatures\n  and writes new type data into a symtypes file.\n  * The script rpm/modversions is invoked again, this time it packs all new\n  symtypes files to a consolidated kABI file.\n  * The downstream script rpm/kabi.pl checks symbol CRCs in the new build and\n  compares them to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking\n  kabi/severities into account.\n  suse-kabi-tools is a new set of tools to improve the kABI checking process.\n  The suite includes two tools, ksymtypes and ksymvers, which replace the\n  existing scripts rpm/modversions and rpm/kabi.pl, as well as the comparison\n  functionality previously provided by genksyms. The tools have their own\n  source repository and package.\n  The tools provide faster operation and more detailed, unified output. In\n  addition, they allow the use of the new upstream tool gendwarfksyms, which\n  lacks any built-in comparison functionality.\n  The updated workflow is as follows:\n  * The build performs a regular kernel make. During this operation, genksyms\n  (gendwarfksyms) is invoked as usual, determinining signatures and CRCs of\n  all exports and writing the type data to symtypes files. However,\n  genksyms no longer performs any comparison.\n  * 'ksymtypes consolidate' packs all new symtypes files to a consolidated\n  kABI file.\n  * 'ksymvers compare' checks symbol CRCs in the new build and compares them\n  to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking kabi/severities\n  into account. The tool writes its result in a human-readable form on\n  standard output and also writes a list of all changed exports (not\n  ignored by kabi/severities) to the changed-exports file.\n  * 'ksymtypes compare' takes the changed-exports file, the consolidated kABI\n  symtypes reference data from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symtypes-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt; and the new\n  consolidated data.

Because when reserving metadata space\nfor a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there is\nnot enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,\nwhich was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (\"btrfs: fix deadlock when\ncloning inline extent and low on free metadata space\").\n\nHowever when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroup\nspace, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is not\nenough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, since\nflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree\nand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone\noperation, before attempting to start the transaction.\n\nWhen this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:\n\n  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)\n  [72747.556271] Call Trace:\n  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40\n  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280\n  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70\n  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160\n  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210\n  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20\n  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0\n  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440\n  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0\n  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0\n  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50\n  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490\n  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0\n  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  [72747.566961] Call Trace:\n  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380\n  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0\n  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0\n  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0\n  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100\n  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    \n---truncated---",

For example:\n\n\t[80468.182258] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff8b6648b0\n\t  :\n\t[80468.191019] RIP: 0010:dl_cpu_busy+0x30/0x2b0\n\t  :\n\t[80468.207946] Call Trace:\n\t[80468.208947]  cpuset_can_attach+0xa0/0x140\n\t[80468.209953]  cgroup_migrate_execute+0x8c/0x490\n\t[80468.210931]  cgroup_update_dfl_csses+0x254/0x270\n\t[80468.211898]  cgroup_subtree_control_write+0x322/0x400\n\t[80468.212854]  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x11c/0x1b0\n\t[80468.213777]  new_sync_write+0x11f/0x1b0\n\t[80468.214689]  vfs_write+0x1eb/0x280\n\t[80468.215592]  ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0\n\t[80468.216463]  do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x80\n\t[80468.224287]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n\nFix that by using effective_cpus instead.

For v2, effective_cpus is the real cpumask\nto be used by tasks within the cpuset anyway.\n\nAlso update task_can_attach()'s 2nd argument name to cs_effective_cpus to\nreflect the change. In addition, a check is added to task_can_attach()\nto guard against the possibility that cpumask_any_and() may return a\nvalue \u003e= nr_cpu_ids.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: n_gsm: fix deadlock and link starvation in outgoing data path\n\nThe current implementation queues up new control and user packets as needed\nand processes this queue down to the ldisc in the same code path.\nThat means that the upper and the lower layer are hard coupled in the code.\nDue to this deadlocks can happen as seen below while transmitting data,\nespecially during ldisc congestion. Furthermore, the data channels starve\nthe control channel on high transmission load on the ldisc.\n\nIntroduce an additional control channel data queue to prevent timeouts and\nlink hangups during ldisc congestion. This is being processed before the\nuser channel data queue in gsm_data_kick(), i.e. with the highest priority.\nPut the queue to ldisc data path into a workqueue and trigger it whenever\nnew data has been put into the transmission queue. Change\ngsm_dlci_data_sweep() accordingly to fill up the transmission queue until\nTX_THRESH_HI. This solves the locking issue, keeps latency low and provides\ngood performance on high data load.\nNote that now all packets from a DLCI are removed from the internal queue\nif the associated DLCI was closed. This ensures that no data is sent by the\nintroduced write task to an already closed DLCI.\n\nBUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, test_v24_loop/124\n lock: serial8250_ports+0x3a8/0x7500, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: test_v24_loop/124, .owner_cpu: 0\nCPU: 0 PID: 124 Comm: test_v24_loop Tainted: G           O      5.18.0-rc2 #3\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x34/0x44\n do_raw_spin_lock+0x76/0xa0\n _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x72/0x80\n uart_write_room+0x3b/0xc0\n gsm_data_kick+0x14b/0x240 [n_gsm]\n gsmld_write_wakeup+0x35/0x70 [n_gsm]\n tty_wakeup+0x53/0x60\n tty_port_default_wakeup+0x1b/0x30\n serial8250_tx_chars+0x12f/0x220\n serial8250_handle_irq.part.0+0xfe/0x150\n serial8250_default_handle_irq+0x48/0x80\n serial8250_interrupt+0x56/0xa0\n __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x78/0x1f0\n handle_irq_event+0x34/0x70\n handle_fasteoi_irq+0x90/0x1e0\n __common_interrupt+0x69/0x100\n common_interrupt+0x48/0xc0\n asm_common_interrupt+0x1e/0x40\nRIP: 0010:__do_softirq+0x83/0x34e\nCode: 2a 0a ff 0f b7 ed c7 44 24 10 0a 00 00 00 48 c7 c7 51 2a 64 82 e8 2d\ne2 d5 ff 65 66 c7 05 83 af 1e 7e 00 00 fb b8 ff ff ff ff \u003c49\u003e c7 c2 40 61\n80 82 0f bc c5 41 89 c4 41 83 c4 01 0f 84 e6 00 00\nRSP: 0018:ffffc90000003f98 EFLAGS: 00000286\nRAX: 00000000ffffffff RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffffff82642a51 RDI: ffffffff825bb5e7\nRBP: 0000000000000200 R08: 00000008de3271a8 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000030 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n ? __do_softirq+0x73/0x34e\n irq_exit_rcu+0xb5/0x100\n common_interrupt+0xa4/0xc0\n \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n asm_common_interrupt+0x1e/0x40\nRIP: 0010:_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x2e/0x50\nCode: 00 55 48 89 fd 48 83 c7 18 53 48 89 f3 48 8b 74 24 10 e8 85 28 36 ff\n48 89 ef e8 cd 58 36 ff 80 e7 02 74 01 fb bf 01 00 00 00 \u003ce8\u003e 3d 97 33 ff\n65 8b 05 96 23 2b 7e 85 c0 74 03 5b 5d c3 0f 1f 44\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000020fd08 EFLAGS: 00000202\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000246 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000004 RSI: ffffffff8257fd74 RDI: 0000000000000001\nRBP: ffff8880057de3a0 R08: 00000008de233000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000100 R14: 0000000000000202 R15: ffff8880057df0b8\n ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x23/0x50\n gsmtty_write+0x65/0x80 [n_gsm]\n n_tty_write+0x33f/0x530\n ? swake_up_all+0xe0/0xe0\n file_tty_write.constprop.0+0x1b1/0x320\n ? n_tty_flush_buffer+0xb0/0xb0\n new_sync_write+0x10c/0x190\n vfs_write+0x282/0x310\n ksys_write+0x68/0xe0\n do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\nRIP: 0033:0x7f3e5e35c15c\nCode: 8b 7c 24 08 89 c5 e8 c5 ff ff ff 89 ef 89 44 24\n---truncated---",

On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in\n-\u003endo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to -\u003edisconnect() by historic\ncommit \"[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock\":\n\n  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c\n\nThe change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue\nimplementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait\nfor completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that\ncould deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex\nheld in -\u003endo_stop().\n\nThe commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a\nuse-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,\nax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:\n\n* If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before\n  disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)\n  -\u003estatus() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().\n* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's -\u003elink_reset() callback,\n  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().\n* That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().\n\nBecause usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),\nnetif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and\nlinkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.\n\nIn 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of\nusbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf\n(\"drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()\").\n\nUnfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to\n-\u003endo_stop().

However, during rollback, msg-\u003emsg_iter is reset, but since\nmsg_pl-\u003esg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the\nactual size of msg_iter.\n'''\niov_iter_revert(\u0026msg-\u003emsg_iter, msg_pl-\u003esg.size - orig_size);\n'''\n\nThe changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:\n\n1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is\npointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.\n\n2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.\n\nAssume the original data is \"abcdefgh\" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes\nby the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: \"abc?de?fgh?\".\nThen, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been\nprocessed, and the remaining 5 bytes \"?fgh?\" will be cached until the\nlength meets the cork_bytes requirement.\n\nHowever, some data in \"?fgh?\" is not within 'sg-\u003emsg_iter'\n(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data \"?\" we pushed.\n\nSo it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of\nmsg_iter.\n\n3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a \"cork\" situation occurs,\nthe user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is\nthe same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.\n\nAdditionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling\ncorking is written as:\n'''\nline 1177\nelse if (ret != -EAGAIN) {\n\tif (ret == -ENOSPC)\n\t\tret = 0;\n\tgoto send_end;\n'''\n\nSo it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a \"cork\" situation\noccurs.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/iwcm: Fix use-after-free of work objects after cm_id destruction\n\nThe commit 59c68ac31e15 (\"iw_cm: free cm_id resources on the last\nderef\") simplified cm_id resource management by freeing cm_id once all\nreferences to the cm_id were removed. The references are removed either\nupon completion of iw_cm event handlers or when the application destroys\nthe cm_id. This commit introduced the use-after-free condition where\ncm_id_private object could still be in use by event handler works during\nthe destruction of cm_id. The commit aee2424246f9 (\"RDMA/iwcm: Fix a\nuse-after-free related to destroying CM IDs\") addressed this use-after-\nfree by flushing all pending works at the cm_id destruction.\n\nHowever, still another use-after-free possibility remained. It happens\nwith the work objects allocated for each cm_id_priv within\nalloc_work_entries() during cm_id creation, and subsequently freed in\ndealloc_work_entries() once all references to the cm_id are removed.\nIf the cm_id's last reference is decremented in the event handler work,\nthe work object for the work itself gets removed, and causes the use-\nafter-free BUG below:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff88811f9cf800 by task kworker/u16:1/147091\n\n  CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 147091 Comm: kworker/u16:1 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc2+ #27 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-3.fc41 04/01/2014\n  Workqueue:  0x0 (iw_cm_wq)\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x90\n   print_report+0x174/0x554\n   ? __virt_addr_valid+0x208/0x430\n   ? __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   kasan_report+0xae/0x170\n   ? __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   pwq_dec_nr_in_flight+0x8c5/0xfb0\n   process_one_work+0xc11/0x1460\n   ? __pfx_process_one_work+0x10/0x10\n   ? assign_work+0x16c/0x240\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0xb0\n   ? _raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x24/0x50\n   ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0xb0\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  Allocated by task 147416:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_save_track+0x10/0x30\n   __kasan_kmalloc+0xa6/0xb0\n   alloc_work_entries+0xa9/0x260 [iw_cm]\n   iw_cm_connect+0x23/0x4a0 [iw_cm]\n   rdma_connect_locked+0xbfd/0x1920 [rdma_cm]\n   nvme_rdma_cm_handler+0x8e5/0x1b60 [nvme_rdma]\n   cma_cm_event_handler+0xae/0x320 [rdma_cm]\n   cma_work_handler+0x106/0x1b0 [rdma_cm]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\n  Freed by task 147091:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_save_track+0x10/0x30\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x37/0x60\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x4b/0x70\n   kfree+0x13a/0x4b0\n   dealloc_work_entries+0x125/0x1f0 [iw_cm]\n   iwcm_deref_id+0x6f/0xa0 [iw_cm]\n   cm_work_handler+0x136/0x1ba0 [iw_cm]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\n  Last potentially related work creation:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_record_aux_stack+0xa3/0xb0\n   __queue_work+0x2ff/0x1390\n   queue_work_on+0x67/0xc0\n   cm_event_handler+0x46a/0x820 [iw_cm]\n   siw_cm_upcall+0x330/0x650 [siw]\n   siw_cm_work_handler+0x6b9/0x2b20 [siw]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nThis BUG is reproducible by repeating the blktests test case nvme/061\nfor the rdma transport and the siw driver.\n\nTo avoid the use-after-free of cm_id_private work objects, ensure that\nthe last reference to the cm_id is decremented not in the event handler\nworks, but in the cm_id destruction context.

These operations are\ndone under atm_dev_mutex.\n\nHowever, when removing a device in atm_dev_deregister(), it releases the\nmutex just after removing the device from the list that __atm_dev_lookup()\niterates over.\n\nSo, there will be a small race window where the device does not exist on\nthe device list but procfs/sysfs are still not removed, triggering the\nsplat.\n\nLet's hold the mutex until procfs/sysfs are removed in\natm_dev_deregister().\n\n[0]:\nproc_dir_entry 'atm/atmtcp:0' already registered\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5919 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x455/0x5f0 fs/proc/generic.c:377\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5919 Comm: syz-executor284 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc2-syzkaller-00047-g52da431bf03b #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nRIP: 0010:proc_register+0x455/0x5f0 fs/proc/generic.c:377\nCode: 48 89 f9 48 c1 e9 03 80 3c 01 00 0f 85 a2 01 00 00 48 8b 44 24 10 48 c7 c7 20 c0 c2 8b 48 8b b0 d8 00 00 00 e8 0c 02 1c ff 90 \u003c0f\u003e 0b 90 90 48 c7 c7 80 f2 82 8e e8 0b de 23 09 48 8b 4c 24 28 48\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000466fa30 EFLAGS: 00010282\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: ffffffff817ae248\nRDX: ffff888026280000 RSI: ffffffff817ae255 RDI: 0000000000000001\nRBP: ffff8880232bed48 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffff888076ed2140\nR13: dffffc0000000000 R14: ffff888078a61340 R15: ffffed100edda444\nFS:  00007f38b3b0c6c0(0000) GS:ffff888124753000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f38b3bdf953 CR3: 0000000076d58000 CR4: 00000000003526f0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n proc_create_data+0xbe/0x110 fs/proc/generic.c:585\n atm_proc_dev_register+0x112/0x1e0 net/atm/proc.c:361\n atm_dev_register+0x46d/0x890 net/atm/resources.c:113\n atmtcp_create+0x77/0x210 drivers/atm/atmtcp.c:369\n atmtcp_attach drivers/atm/atmtcp.c:403 [inline]\n atmtcp_ioctl+0x2f9/0xd60 drivers/atm/atmtcp.c:464\n do_vcc_ioctl+0x12c/0x930 net/atm/ioctl.c:159\n sock_do_ioctl+0x115/0x280 net/socket.c:1190\n sock_ioctl+0x227/0x6b0 net/socket.c:1311\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:893 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x18b/0x210 fs/ioctl.c:893\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xcd/0x4c0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7f38b3b74459\nCode: 28 00 00 00 75 05 48 83 c4 28 c3 e8 51 18 00 00 90 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 b0 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007f38b3b0c198 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007f38b3bfe318 RCX: 00007f38b3b74459\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000006180 RDI: 0000000000000005\nRBP: 00007f38b3bfe310 R08: 65732f636f72702f R09: 65732f636f72702f\nR10: 65732f636f72702f R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f38b3bcb0ac\nR13: 00007f38b3b0c1a0 R14: 0000200000000200 R15: 00007f38b3bcb03b\n \u003c/TASK\u003e",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev-\u003edev-\u003edriver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev-\u003edestruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Always pass notifications when child class becomes empty\n\nCertain classful qdiscs may invoke their classes' dequeue handler on an\nenqueue operation. This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus\nmake an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not\nexpect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the\nclass eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThe referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC\ncase by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to\nbe incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.\nThe following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:\n\n    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr\n    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole\n\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n\nSince backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale\nclass pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes\na different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch\nensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when\nthe child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of\nqdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or\nqdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing\nthe following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note\nthat this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This\nis not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the\nclassful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.",

However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/d912cbd7-193b-4269-9857-525bee8bbb6a@gmail.com/",

There are a couple of\nproblems with the above scheme.\n\nThe first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled while the device is running:\n\n # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0\n # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off\n # ip link del dev bond1\n\nWhen the device is put administratively down the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the\nmemory will be leaked [1].\n\nAnother problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically\ndelete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not\nadding it when the device was put administratively up since during that\ntime the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or\nbug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount\nimbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:\n\n$ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0\n$ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off\n$ ifconfig bond0 up\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on\n$ ifconfig bond0 down\n$ ip link del vlan0\n\nRoot cause is as below:\nstep1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team.\nregister_vlan_dev\n    vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1\nstep2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev\nstep3: change filter from 0 to 1\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_filter_push_vids\n        ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0\nstep4: real_dev down\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0\n        vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0\nstep5: delete vlan0\nunregister_vlan_dev\n    BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null\n\nFix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was\nautomatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it\nshould be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the\n\"rx-vlan-filter\" feature.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880068e3100 (size 256):\n  comm \"ip\", pid 384, jiffies 4296130254\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 20 30 0d 80 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  . 0.............\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace (crc 81ce31fa):\n    __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2b5/0x340\n    vlan_vid_add+0x434/0x940\n    vlan_device_event.cold+0x75/0xa8\n    notifier_call_chain+0xca/0x150\n    __dev_notify_flags+0xe3/0x250\n    rtnl_configure_link+0x193/0x260\n    rtnl_newlink_create+0x383/0x8e0\n    __rtnl_newlink+0x22c/0xa40\n    rtnl_newlink+0x627/0xb00\n    rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x6fb/0xb70\n    netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x350\n    netlink_unicast+0x426/0x710\n    netlink_sendmsg+0x75a/0xc20\n    __sock_sendmsg+0xc1/0x150\n    ____sys_sendmsg+0x5aa/0x7b0\n    ___sys_sendmsg+0xfc/0x180\n\n[2]\nkernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.c:99!\nOops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 382 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.16.0-rc3 #61 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),\nBIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:unregister_vlan_dev (net/8021q/vlan.c:99 (discriminator 1))\nRSP: 0018:ffff88810badf310 EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88810da84000 RCX: ffffffffb47ceb9a\nRDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: ffff88810e8b43c8\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: fffffbfff6cefe80\nR10: ffffffffb677f407 R11: ffff88810badf3c0 R12: ffff88810e8b4000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffff88810642a5c0 R15: 000000000000017e\nFS:  00007f1ff68c20c0(0000) GS:ffff888163a24000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f1ff5dad240 CR3: 0000000107e56000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: prevent A-MSDU attacks in mesh networks\n\nThis patch is a mitigation to prevent the A-MSDU spoofing vulnerability\nfor mesh networks. The initial update to the IEEE 802.11 standard, in\nresponse to the FragAttacks, missed this case (CVE-2025-27558). It can\nbe considered a variant of CVE-2020-24588 but for mesh networks.\n\nThis patch tries to detect if a standard MSDU was turned into an A-MSDU\nby an adversary. This is done by parsing a received A-MSDU as a standard\nMSDU, calculating the length of the Mesh Control header, and seeing if\nthe 6 bytes after this header equal the start of an rfc1042 header. If\nequal, this is a strong indication of an ongoing attack attempt.\n\nThis defense was tested with mac80211_hwsim against a mesh network that\nuses an empty Mesh Address Extension field, i.e., when four addresses\nare used, and when using a 12-byte Mesh Address Extension field, i.e.,\nwhen six addresses are used. Functionality of normal MSDUs and A-MSDUs\nwas also tested, and confirmed working, when using both an empty and\n12-byte Mesh Address Extension field.\n\nIt was also tested with mac80211_hwsim that A-MSDU attacks in non-mesh\nnetworks keep being detected and prevented.\n\nNote that the vulnerability being patched, and the defense being\nimplemented, was also discussed in the following paper and in the\nfollowing IEEE 802.11 presentation:\n\nhttps://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/wisec2025.pdf\nhttps://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/25/11-25-0949-00-000m-a-msdu-mesh-spoof-protection.docx",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings\n\nThe perf mmap code is careful about mmap()'ing the user page with the\nringbuffer and additionally the auxiliary buffer, when the event supports\nit. Once the first mapping is established, subsequent mapping have to use\nthe same offset and the same size in both cases. The reference counting for\nthe ringbuffer and the auxiliary buffer depends on this being correct.\n\nThough perf does not prevent that a related mapping is split via mmap(2),\nmunmap(2) or mremap(2). A split of a VMA results in perf_mmap_open() calls,\nwhich take reference counts, but then the subsequent perf_mmap_close()\ncalls are not longer fulfilling the offset and size checks. This leads to\nreference count leaks.\n\nAs perf already has the requirement for subsequent mappings to match the\ninitial mapping, the obvious consequence is that VMA splits, caused by\nresizing of a mapping or partial unmapping, have to be prevented.\n\nImplement the vm_operations_struct::may_split() callback and return\nunconditionally -EINVAL.\n\nThat ensures that the mapping offsets and sizes cannot be changed after the\nfact. Remapping to a different fixed address with the same size is still\npossible as it takes the references for the new mapping and drops those of\nthe old mapping.",

On systems where the vulnerability CVE-2024-47176 (cups-filters 1.x/cups-browsed 2.x vulnerability) was not fixed, and the firewall on the machine does not reject incoming communication to IPP port, and the machine is set to be available to public internet, attack vector \"Network\" is possible. The current versions of CUPS and cups-browsed projects have the attack vector \"Adjacent\" in their default configurations. Version 2.4.13 contains a patch for CVE-2025-58364.",
