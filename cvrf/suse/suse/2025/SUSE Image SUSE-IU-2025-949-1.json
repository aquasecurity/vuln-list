      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp6-byos-v20250408-arm64 contains the following changes:\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- Allow dovecot-auth to execute unix_chkpwd from /sbin, not only from /usr/bin  (bsc#1234452)\n  * Update dovecot-unix_chkpwd.diff\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update named.root to latest version- Update to release 9.18.33\n  Security Fixes:\n  * DNS-over-HTTPS flooding fixes.\n    Fix DNS-over-HTTPS implementation issues that arise under heavy\n    query load. Optimize resource usage for named instances that\n    accept queries over DNS-over-HTTPS.\n    Previously, named processed all incoming HTTP/2 data at once,\n    which could overwhelm the server, especially when dealing with\n    clients that sent requests but did not wait for responses. That\n    has been fixed. Now, named handles HTTP/2 data in smaller\n    chunks and throttles reading until the remote side reads the\n    response data. It also throttles clients that send too many\n    requests at once.\n    In addition, named now evaluates excessive streams opened by\n    clients that include no DNS data, which is considered\n    âflooding.â It logs these clients and drops connections from\n    them.\n    In some cases, named could leave DNS-over-HTTPS connections in\n    the CLOSE_WAIT state indefinitely. That has also been fixed.\n    (CVE-2024-12705)\n    [bsc#1236597]\n  * Limit additional section processing for large RDATA sets.\n    When answering queries, donât add data to the additional\n    section if the answer has more than 13 names in the RDATA. This\n    limits the number of lookups into the database(s) during a\n    single client query, reducing the query-processing load.\n    (CVE-2024-11187)\n    [bsc#1236596]\n  New Features:\n  * Add a new option to configure the maximum number of outgoing\n    queries per client request.\n  * The configuration option max-query-count sets how many outgoing\n    queries per client request are allowed. The existing\n    max-recursion-queries value is the number of permissible\n    queries for a single name and is reset on every CNAME\n    redirection. This new option is a global limit on the client\n    request. The default is 200.\n  * The default for max-recursion-queries is changed from 32 to 50.\n    This allows named to send a few more queries while looking up a\n    single name.\n  * Print the full path of the working directory in startup log\n    messages.\n    named now prints its initial working directory during startup,\n    and the changed working directory when loading or reloading its\n    configuration file, if it has a valid directory option defined.\n  * Added WALLET type.\n    Add the new record type WALLET (262). This provides a mapping\n    from a domain name to a cryptographic currency wallet. Multiple\n    mappings can exist if multiple records exist.\n  * Update built-in bind.keys file with the new 2025 IANA root key.\n  * Add an initial-ds entry to bind.keys for the new root key, ID\n    38696, which is scheduled for publication in January 2025.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * Tighten max-recursion-queries and add max-query-restarts\n    configuration statement.\n    There were cases when the max-recursion-queries quota was\n    ineffective. It was possible to craft zones that would cause a\n    resolver to waste resources by sending excessive queries while\n    attempting to resolve a name. This has been addressed by\n    correcting errors in the implementation of\n    max-recursion-queries and by reducing the default value from\n    100 to 32.\n    In addition, a new max-query-restarts configuration statement\n    has been added, which limits the number of times a recursive\n    server will follow CNAME or DNAME records before terminating\n    resolution. This was previously a hard-coded limit of 16 but is\n    now configurable with a default value of 11.\n  * Raise the log level of priming failures.\n    When a priming query is complete, it was previously logged at\n    level DEBUG(1), regardless of success or failure. It is now\n    logged to NOTICE in the case of failure.\n  * Add a compatibility shim for older libuv versions (\u0026lt; 1.19.0)\n    The function uv_stream_get_write_queue_size() is supported only\n    in relatively new versions of libuv (1.19.0 or higher). Provide\n    a compatibility shim for this function so BIND 9 can be built\n    in environments with older libuv versions.\n  * Improve performance for queries that require an NSEC3 wildcard\n    proof.\n    Rather than starting from the longest matching part of the\n    requested name, lookup the shortest partial match. Most of the\n    time this will be the actual closest encloser.\n  * Follow the number of CPUs set by taskset/cpuset.\n    Administrators may wish to constrain the set of cores that\n    named runs on via the taskset, cpuset, or numactl programs (or\n    equivalents on other OSes).\n    If the admin has used taskset, named now automatically uses the\n    given number of CPUs rather than the system-wide count.\n  * Allow IXFR-to-AXFR fallback on DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.\n    This change allows fallback from an IXFR failure to AXFR when\n    the reason is DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.\n  * Emit more helpful log messages for exceeding\n    max-records-per-type.\n  * The new log message is emitted when adding or updating an RRset\n    fails due to exceeding the max-records-per-type limit. The log\n    includes the owner name and type, corresponding zone name, and\n    the limit value. It will be emitted on loading a zone file,\n    inbound zone transfer (both AXFR and IXFR), handling a DDNS\n    update, or updating a cache DB. Itâs especially helpful in the\n    case of zone transfer, since the secondary side doesnât have\n    direct access to the offending zone data.\n  * It could also be used for max-types-per-name, but this change\n    doesnât implement it yet as itâs much less likely to happen in\n    practice.\n  * Harden key management when key files have become unavailable.\n  * Prior to doing key management, BIND 9 will check if the key\n    files on disk match the expected keys. If key files for\n    previously observed keys have become unavailable, this will\n    prevent the internal key manager from running.\n  Removed Features:\n  * Move contributed DLZ modules into a separate repository. DLZ\n    modules should not be used except in testing. The DLZ modules\n    were not maintained, the DLZ interface itself is going to be\n    scheduled for removal, and the DLZ interface is blocking. Any\n    module that blocks the query to the database blocks the whole\n    server. The DLZ modules now live in\n    https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/dlz-modules repository.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  For a complete list of bug fixes, see:\n  * Bind Release Notes\n    https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9.18.33/notes.html\n  * The changelog in the doc rpm at\n    /usr/share/doc/packages/bind/arm/html/changelog.html\n\nPackage branding-SLE was updated:\n\n- Update plymouth theme to fix splash screen element placement issue.

Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

No\n   attempt will be made to access -\u003eusage after this as the\n   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.\n\nThanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/994410bb-89aa-d987-1f50-f514903c55aa@quicinc.com/\n\nOn Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL], we are able to see bunch of\nissues daily while testing on a device farm.\n\nFor this particular issue below is the log.

So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0697. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-\u003e ...\n   -\u003e dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -\u003e ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n         -\u003e lan9303_phy_read()\n            -\u003e chip-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n               -\u003e lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -\u003e dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp-\u003econduit-\u003edsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev-\u003edsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev-\u003edsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit-\u003edsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n(\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit-\u003edsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up).",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid\n\nThere is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations\nand a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the\nfollowint use-after-free KASAN warning:\n\nkernel: ==================================================================\nkernel: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in nfsd_breaker_owns_lease+0x140/0x160 [nfsd]\nkernel: Read of size 8 at addr ffff0000e73cd0c8 by task nfsd/6205\nkernel:\nkernel: CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 6205 Comm: nfsd Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #9\nkernel: Hardware name: Apple Inc.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.\n\nRecently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while\nreconnecting to a server.  [0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

When the network namespace is deleted, the net structure\naccessed by tcp's timer handler function causes problems.\n\nTo fix this problem, let's hold netns refcnt for the tcp kernel socket as\ndone in other modules. This is an ugly hack which can easily be backported\nto earlier kernels. A proper fix which cleans up the interfaces will\nfollow, but may not be so easy to backport.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix use-after-free of slot-\u003ebus on hot remove\n\nDennis reports a boot crash on recent Lenovo laptops with a USB4 dock.\n\nSince commit 0fc70886569c (\"thunderbolt: Reset USB4 v2 host router\") and\ncommit 59a54c5f3dbd (\"thunderbolt: Reset topology created by the boot\nfirmware\"), USB4 v2 and v1 Host Routers are reset on probe of the\nthunderbolt driver.\n\nThe reset clears the Presence Detect State and Data Link Layer Link Active\nbits at the USB4 Host Router's Root Port and thus causes hot removal of the\ndock.\n\nThe crash occurs when pciehp is unbound from one of the dock's Downstream\nPorts:  pciehp creates a pci_slot on bind and destroys it on unbind.  The\npci_slot contains a pointer to the pci_bus below the Downstream Port, but\na reference on that pci_bus is never acquired.  The pci_bus is destroyed\nbefore the pci_slot, so a use-after-free ensues when pci_slot_release()\naccesses slot-\u003ebus.\n\nIn principle this should not happen because pci_stop_bus_device() unbinds\npciehp (and therefore destroys the pci_slot) before the pci_bus is\ndestroyed by pci_remove_bus_device().\n\nHowever the stacktrace provided by Dennis shows that pciehp is unbound from\npci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  To understand\nthe significance of this, one needs to know that the PCI core uses a two\nstep process to remove a portion of the hierarchy:  It first unbinds all\ndrivers in the sub-hierarchy in pci_stop_bus_device() and then actually\nremoves the devices in pci_remove_bus_device().  There is no precaution to\nprevent driver binding in-between pci_stop_bus_device() and\npci_remove_bus_device().\n\nIn Dennis' case, it seems removal of the hierarchy by pciehp races with\ndriver binding by pci_bus_add_devices().  pciehp is bound to the\nDownstream Port after pci_stop_bus_device() has run, so it is unbound by\npci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  Because the\npci_bus has already been destroyed at that point, accesses to it result in\na use-after-free.\n\nOne might conclude that driver binding needs to be prevented after\npci_stop_bus_device() has run.  However it seems risky that pci_slot points\nto pci_bus without holding a reference.  Solely relying on correct ordering\nof driver unbind versus pci_bus destruction is certainly not defensive\nprogramming.\n\nIf pci_slot has a need to access data in pci_bus, it ought to acquire a\nreference.  Amend pci_create_slot() accordingly.  Dennis reports that the\ncrash is not reproducible with this change.\n\nAbridged stacktrace:\n\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: PME: Signaling with IRQ 156\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: pciehp: Slot #12 AttnBtn- PwrCtrl- MRL- AttnInd- PwrInd- HotPlug+ Surprise+ Interlock- NoCompl+ IbPresDis- LLActRep+\n  pci_bus 0000:20: dev 00, created physical slot 12\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: pciehp: Slot(12): Card not present\n  ...\n  pcieport 0000:21:02.0: pciehp: pcie_disable_notification: SLOTCTRL d8 write cmd 0\n  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 13 UID: 0 PID: 134 Comm: irq/156-pciehp Not tainted 6.11.0-devel+ #1\n  RIP: 0010:dev_driver_string+0x12/0x40\n  pci_destroy_slot\n  pciehp_remove\n  pcie_port_remove_service\n  device_release_driver_internal\n  bus_remove_device\n  device_del\n  device_unregister\n  remove_iter\n  device_for_each_child\n  pcie_portdrv_remove\n  pci_device_remove\n  device_release_driver_internal\n  bus_remove_device\n  device_del\n  pci_remove_bus_device (recursive invocation)\n  pci_remove_bus_device\n  pciehp_unconfigure_device\n  pciehp_disable_slot\n  pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change\n  pciehp_ist",

In the\nxenbus_dev_probe() function, within the if (err) branch at line 313, the\nprogram incorrectly returns err directly without releasing the resources\nallocated by err = drv-\u003eprobe(dev, id). As the return value is non-zero,\nthe upper layers assume the processing logic has failed. However, the probe\noperation was performed earlier without a corresponding remove operation.\nSince the probe actually allocates resources, failing to perform the remove\noperation could lead to problems.\n\nTo fix this issue, we followed the resource release logic of the\nxenbus_dev_remove() function by adding a new block fail_remove before the\nfail_put block. After entering the branch if (err) at line 313, the\nfunction will use a goto statement to jump to the fail_remove block,\nensuring that the previously acquired resources are correctly released,\nthus preventing the reference count leak.\n\nThis bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed\nby our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operations\nand detecting potential issues where resources are not properly managed.\nIn this case, the tool flagged the missing release operation as a\npotential problem, which led to the development of this patch.",

This crash\nhappens because during hot-unplug __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()\nattaching the default domain fails when the platform no longer\nrecognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up with\na NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to in\nthe second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as stated\nthere if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is prevented\nas this can handle the already removed device. Implement the blocking\ndomain to use this handling.  With this change, the crash is fixed but\nwe still hit a warning attempting to change DMA ownership on a blocked\ndevice.",

One of these cases is a loop device by\nusing ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWhile this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of\nhfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write\nout-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the\nlatter function reads a different io_size.\n\nUsing a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the\npurposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between\nHFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the\nmax between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not\ninitialized.\n\nTested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024\nand 4096.\n\nThe produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:\n\n[  419.944641] ==================================================================\n[  419.945655] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.946703] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800721fc00 by task repro/10678\n[  419.947612]\n[  419.947846] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10678 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00008-gdf56e0f2f3ca #84\n[  419.949007] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[  419.950035] Call Trace:\n[  419.950384]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  419.950676]  dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x78\n[  419.951212]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.951830]  print_report+0x14c/0x49e\n[  419.952361]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x267/0x278\n[  419.952979]  ? kmem_cache_debug_flags+0xc/0x1d\n[  419.953561]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.954231]  kasan_report+0x89/0xb0\n[  419.954748]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955367]  hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955948]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x10/0x10\n[  419.956618]  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x59/0x1a9\n[  419.957214]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1a/0x2e\n[  419.957772]  hfsplus_fill_super+0x348/0x1590\n[  419.958355]  ? hlock_class+0x4c/0x109\n[  419.958867]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.959499]  ? __pfx_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.960006]  ? lock_acquire+0x3e2/0x454\n[  419.960532]  ? bdev_name.constprop.0+0xce/0x243\n[  419.961129]  ? __pfx_bdev_name.constprop.0+0x10/0x10\n[  419.961799]  ? pointer+0x3f0/0x62f\n[  419.962277]  ? __pfx_pointer+0x10/0x10\n[  419.962761]  ? vsnprintf+0x6c4/0xfba\n[  419.963178]  ? __pfx_vsnprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.963621]  ? setup_bdev_super+0x376/0x3b3\n[  419.964029]  ? snprintf+0x9d/0xd2\n[  419.964344]  ? __pfx_snprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.964675]  ? lock_acquired+0x45c/0x5e9\n[  419.965016]  ? set_blocksize+0x139/0x1c1\n[  419.965381]  ? sb_set_blocksize+0x6d/0xae\n[  419.965742]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966179]  mount_bdev+0x12f/0x1bf\n[  419.966512]  ? __pfx_mount_bdev+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966886]  ? vfs_parse_fs_string+0xce/0x111\n[  419.967293]  ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.967702]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.968073]  legacy_get_tree+0x104/0x178\n[  419.968414]  vfs_get_tree+0x86/0x296\n[  419.968751]  path_mount+0xba3/0xd0b\n[  419.969157]  ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.969594]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x1e2/0x260\n[  419.970311]  do_mount+0x99/0xe0\n[  419.970630]  ? __pfx_do_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.971008]  __do_sys_mount+0x199/0x1c9\n[  419.971397]  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x135\n[  419.971761]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[  419.972233] RIP: 0033:0x7c3cb812972e\n[  419.972564] Code: 48 8b 0d f5 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d c2 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\n[  419.974371] RSP: 002b:00007ffe30632548 EFLAGS: 00000286 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n[  419.975048] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe306328d8 RCX: 00007c3cb812972e\n[  419.975701] RDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000020000c80 RDI:\n---truncated---",

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes\nidr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a\nsimilar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s-\u003ecpu_slab-\u003elock) is\nstill a spinlock.\n\nInstead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking\nhtab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring\nthe invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map\npointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.\nTherefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these\nto-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.\n\nThere are four callers for -\u003emap_fd_put_ptr:\n\n(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIt invokes -\u003emap_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of\nhtab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),\nbecause the old element has already been stashed in htab-\u003eextra_elems.\nIt may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the\ninvocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release\nthe newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer\nof the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and\nreleasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old\nelement, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old\nelement as well.\n\n(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIts caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),\nhtab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().\n\nFor htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after\nhtab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just\nlike lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list\nand invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe\nto reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these\nelements have been removed from the hash llist.\n\nBecause htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,\n__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept\nit as\n---truncated---",

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a\nslab-use-after-free error.\n\nMove the kref_put(\u0026sfp-\u003ef_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the\nopen_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper\nsequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the\nrisk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket\n\nDst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is\nexecuted for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There\nare several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur:\n* an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received,\n  resulting in an exception dst being created\n* a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must\n  start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions\n* after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run\n  before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst\n\nWhen TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has\nexpired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the\nrefcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment\nmade by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the\nconnection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never\nreleased. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but\nthat decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just\nbefore the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After\nip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the\ndst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is\nno longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked\nobject.\n\nAs a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the\nloopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do\nnot contain e5f80fcf869a (\"ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev\"):\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The\npatch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was\n92f1655aa2b22 (\"net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race\"). But 92f1655aa2b22\nmerely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue\nwas present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in\n54c1a859efd9f (\"ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually\nexpired.\") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache\nmember of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but\nthe refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced.\n\nThe IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug.\nWhen the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the\nsk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the\nexception dst.",

The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().\n2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an\n   interrupt.\n3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an\n   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has\n   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag\n   remains set.\n4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call\n   of req-\u003ecomplete(), as shown in the call trace above.\n5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)\n   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the\n   request before invoking the callback.\n6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware\n   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains\n   set.\n\nFor this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at\nsome point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet\ngadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the\ntask context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are\nre-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The\ngadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but\nthe first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,\ntriggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet\narrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from\nreceiving any further packets from the USB host.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This\nparticular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:\n\n1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to\n   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was\n   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.\n   Similar \"bugs\" could be hidden in other drivers as well.\n2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback\n   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),\n   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled\n   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow\n   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an\n   inelegant hack.\n3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request\n   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes\n   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is\n   not ready to process them.\n4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().\n   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at\n   least one request in the queue.

This\nmodification ensures that the value of fmdev-\u003eresp_skb does not change\nduring the validation process, thereby maintaining its validity.\n\nThis possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool\ndeveloped by our team.

This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",

By doing so, the patch ensures proper\nnode balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL,\nand prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused by\nallow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false.\n\n\nThe kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), caused\nby a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certain\nzones, such as ZONE_NORMAL.

Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]",

When performing a symlink lookup from a romfs filesystem, grub's romfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciously crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registers\n\nThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an -\u003eactive() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -\u003eactive() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The -\u003eactive() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the -\u003eget() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer.

This also has the benefit of improving\nreadability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into\nthese helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the\ncode (which was the cause of the original logic error).\n\nAs part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated\ninto a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the\nost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a\nsparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect\nof this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow\nstays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should\nnot make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth\ncomplicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function\n\nThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()\nand cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -\u003e\nlist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these\nfunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead\nto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the\nsubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a\nmodification.\n\nIn the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP\nfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list\nhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and\nturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the\nlist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this\noccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and\na UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,\nprior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it\nwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's\nsynchronize_rcu.\n\nThe thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins\nlist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just\nthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.\n\nFortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()\nfunction to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single\nREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.\n\nThis was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning\nsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",

It sets carrier ON\non start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.\nAnd it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.\nTherefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit\nthe infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There\nmight be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is\nimportant for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a\npacket sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the\nissue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.\n\nFix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running\nstate is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers\nunregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets\nto devices that are not running anyway.\n\nWhile only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier\ncheck is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined\nthroughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions\nlike __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit\na packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.",

As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job.

      "Description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.",

      "Description": "XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus command-line tools. In XZ Utils 5.3.3alpha to 5.8.0, the multithreaded .xz decoder in liblzma has a bug where invalid input can at least result in a crash. The effects include heap use after free and writing to an address based on the null pointer plus an offset. Applications and libraries that use the lzma_stream_decoder_mt function are affected. The bug has been fixed in XZ Utils 5.8.1, and the fix has been committed to the v5.4, v5.6, v5.8, and master branches in the xz Git repository. No new release packages will be made from the old stable branches, but a standalone patch is available that applies to all affected releases.",
