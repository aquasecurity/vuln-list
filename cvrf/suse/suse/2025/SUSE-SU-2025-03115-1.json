      "Text": "This update for go1.25-openssl fixes the following issues:\n\n\nUpdate to version 1.25.0 cut from the go1.25-fips-release\nbranch at the revision tagged go1.25.0-1-openssl-fips.\n( jsc#SLE-18320 )\n\n  * Rebase to 1.25.0\n  * Fix HKDF-Extract The latest OpenSSL in c9s/c10s requires nil\n    salt to be passed as a hash length buffer of zeros.\n\ngo1.25 (released 2025-08-12) is a major release of Go.\ngo1.25.x minor releases will be provided through August 2026.\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle\n\ngo1.25 arrives six months after Go 1.24. Most of its changes are\nin the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and\nlibraries. As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of\ncompatibility. We expect almost all Go programs to continue to\ncompile and run as before.\n\n( bsc#1244485 go1.25 release tracking )\n\n  * Language changes: There are no languages changes that affect Go\n    programs in Go 1.25. However, in the language specification the\n    notion of core types has been removed in favor of dedicated\n    prose. See the respective blog post for more information.\n  * go command: The go build -asan option now defaults to doing\n    leak detection at program exit. This will report an error if\n    memory allocated by C is not freed and is not referenced by any\n    other memory allocated by either C or Go. These new error\n    reports may be disabled by setting ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0\n    in the environment when running the program.\n  * go command: The Go distribution will include fewer prebuilt\n    tool binaries. Core toolchain binaries such as the compiler and\n    linker will still be included, but tools not invoked by build\n    or test operations will be built and run by go tool as needed.\n  * go command: The new go.mod ignore directive can be used to\n    specify directories the go command should ignore. Files in\n    these directories and their subdirectories will be ignored by\n    the go command when matching package patterns, such as all or\n    ./..., but will still be included in module zip files.\n  * go command: The new go doc -http option will start a\n    documentation server showing documentation for the requested\n    object, and open the documentation in a browser window.\n  * go command: The new go version -m -json option will print the\n    JSON encodings of the runtime/debug.BuildInfo structures\n    embedded in the given Go binary files.\n  * go command: The go command now supports using a subdirectory of\n    a repository as the path for a module root, when resolving a\n    module path using the syntax \u003cmeta name='go-import'\n    content='root-path vcs repo-url subdir'\u003e to indicate that the\n    root-path corresponds to the subdir of the repo-url with\n    version control system vcs.\n  * go command: The new work package pattern matches all packages\n    in the work (formerly called main) modules: either the single\n    work module in module mode or the set of workspace modules in\n    workspace mode.\n  * go command: When the go command updates the go line in a go.mod\n    or go.work file, it no longer adds a toolchain line specifying\n    the command’s current version.\n  * go vet: The go vet command includes new analyzers:\n  * go vet: waitgroup reports misplaced calls to\n    sync.WaitGroup.Add;\n  * go vet: hostport reports uses of fmt.Sprintf('%s:%d', host,\n    port) to construct addresses for net.Dial, as these will not\n    work with IPv6; instead it suggests using net.JoinHostPort.\n  * Runtime: Container-aware GOMAXPROCS. The default behavior of\n    the GOMAXPROCS has changed. In prior versions of Go, GOMAXPROCS\n    defaults to the number of logical CPUs available at startup\n    (runtime.NumCPU). Go 1.25 introduces two changes: On Linux, the\n    runtime considers the CPU bandwidth limit of the cgroup\n    containing the process, if any. If the CPU bandwidth limit is\n    lower than the number of logical CPUs available, GOMAXPROCS\n    will default to the lower limit. In container runtime systems\n    like Kubernetes, cgroup CPU bandwidth limits generally\n    correspond to the “CPU limit” option. The Go runtime does not\n    consider the “CPU requests” option.  On all OSes, the runtime\n    periodically updates GOMAXPROCS if the number of logical CPUs\n    available or the cgroup CPU bandwidth limit change.  Both of\n    these behaviors are automatically disabled if GOMAXPROCS is set\n    manually via the GOMAXPROCS environment variable or a call to\n    runtime.GOMAXPROCS. They can also be disabled explicitly with\n    the GODEBUG settings containermaxprocs=0 and updatemaxprocs=0,\n    respectively.  In order to support reading updated cgroup\n    limits, the runtime will keep cached file descriptors for the\n    cgroup files for the duration of the process lifetime.\n  * Runtime: garbage collector: A new garbage collector is now\n    available as an experiment. This garbage collector’s design\n    improves the performance of marking and scanning small objects\n    through better locality and CPU scalability. Benchmark result\n    vary, but we expect somewhere between a 10—40% reduction in\n    garbage collection overhead in real-world programs that heavily\n    use the garbage collector.  The new garbage collector may be\n    enabled by setting GOEXPERIMENT=greenteagc at build time. We\n    expect the design to continue to evolve and improve. To that\n    end, we encourage Go developers to try it out and report back\n    their experiences. See the GitHub issue for more details on the\n    design and instructions for sharing feedback.\n  * Runtime: trace flight recorder: Runtime execution traces have\n    long provided a powerful, but expensive way to understand and\n    debug the low-level behavior of an application. Unfortunately,\n    because of their size and the cost of continuously writing an\n    execution trace, they were generally impractical for debugging\n    rare events.  The new runtime/trace.FlightRecorder API provides\n    a lightweight way to capture a runtime execution trace by\n    continuously recording the trace into an in-memory ring\n    buffer. When a significant event occurs, a program can call\n    FlightRecorder.WriteTo to snapshot the last few seconds of the\n    trace to a file. This approach produces a much smaller trace by\n    enabling applications to capture only the traces that matter.\n    The length of time and amount of data captured by a\n    FlightRecorder may be configured within the\n    FlightRecorderConfig.\n  * Runtime: Change to unhandled panic output: The message printed\n    when a program exits due to an unhandled panic that was\n    recovered and repanicked no longer repeats the text of the\n    panic value.\n  * Runtime: VMA names on Linux: On Linux systems with kernel\n    support for anonymous virtual memory area (VMA) names\n    (CONFIG_ANON_VMA_NAME), the Go runtime will annotate anonymous\n    memory mappings with context about their purpose. e.g., [anon:\n    Go: heap] for heap memory. This can be disabled with the\n    GODEBUG setting decoratemappings=0.\n  * Compiler: nil pointer bug: This release fixes a compiler bug,\n    introduced in Go 1.21, that could incorrectly delay nil pointer\n    checks.\n  * Compiler: DWARF5 support: The compiler and linker in Go 1.25\n    now generate debug information using DWARF version 5. The newer\n    DWARF version reduces the space required for debugging\n    information in Go binaries, and reduces the time for linking,\n    especially for large Go binaries. DWARF 5 generation can be\n    disabled by setting the environment variable\n    GOEXPERIMENT=nodwarf5 at build time (this fallback may be\n    removed in a future Go release).\n  * Compiler: Faster slices: The compiler can now allocate the\n    backing store for slices on the stack in more situations, which\n    improves performance. This change has the potential to amplify\n    the effects of incorrect unsafe.Pointer usage, see for example\n    issue 73199. In order to track down these problems, the bisect\n    tool can be used to find the allocation causing trouble using\n    the -compile=variablemake flag. All such new stack allocations\n    can also be turned off using\n    -gcflags=all=-d=variablemakehash=n.\n  * Linker: The linker now accepts a -funcalign=N command line\n    option, which specifies the alignment of function entries. The\n    default value is platform-dependent, and is unchanged in this\n    release.\n  * Standard library: testing/synctest: The new testing/synctest\n    package provides support for testing concurrent code. This\n    package was first available in Go 1.24 under\n    GOEXPERIMENT=synctest, with a slightly different API. The\n    experiment has now graduated to general availability. The old\n    API is still present if GOEXPERIMENT=synctest is set, but will\n    be removed in Go 1.26.\n  * Standard library: testing/synctest: The Test function runs a\n    test function in an isolated “bubble”. Within the bubble, time\n    is virtualized: time package functions operate on a fake clock\n    and the clock moves forward instantaneously if all goroutines\n    in the bubble are blocked.\n  * Standard library: testing/synctest: The Wait function waits for\n    all goroutines in the current bubble to block.\n  * Standard library: encoding/json/v2: Go 1.25 includes a new,\n    experimental JSON implementation, which can be enabled by\n    setting the environment variable GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 at build\n    time. When enabled, two new packages are available: The\n    encoding/json/v2 package is a major revision of the\n    encoding/json package. The encoding/json/jsontext package\n    provides lower-level processing of JSON syntax. In addition,\n    when the “jsonv2” GOEXPERIMENT is enabled: The encoding/json\n    package uses the new JSON implementation. Marshaling and\n    unmarshaling behavior is unaffected, but the text of errors\n    returned by package function may change. The encoding/json\n    package contains a number of new options which may be used to\n    configure the marshaler and unmarshaler. The new implementation\n    performs substantially better than the existing one under many\n    scenarios. In general, encoding performance is at parity\n    between the implementations and decoding is substantially\n    faster in the new one. See the\n    github.com/go-json-experiment/jsonbench repository for more\n    detailed analysis. We encourage users of encoding/json to test\n    their programs with GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 enabled to help detect\n    any compatibility issues with the new implementation. We expect\n    the design of encoding/json/v2 to continue to evolve. We\n    encourage developers to try out the new API and provide\n    feedback on the proposal issue.\n  * archive/tar: The Writer.AddFS implementation now supports\n    symbolic links for filesystems that implement io/fs.ReadLinkFS.\n  * encoding/asn1: Unmarshal and UnmarshalWithParams now parse the\n    ASN.1 types T61String and BMPString more consistently. This may\n    result in some previously accepted malformed encodings now\n    being rejected.\n  * crypto: MessageSigner is a new signing interface that can be\n    implemented by signers that wish to hash the message to be\n    signed themselves. A new function is also introduced,\n    SignMessage, which attempts to upgrade a Signer interface to\n    MessageSigner, using the MessageSigner.SignMessage method if\n    successful, and Signer.Sign if not. This can be used when code\n    wishes to support both Signer and MessageSigner.\n  * crypto: Changing the fips140 GODEBUG setting after the program\n    has started is now a no-op. Previously, it was documented as\n    not allowed, and could cause a panic if changed.\n  * crypto: SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 are now slower on amd64\n    when AVX2 instructions are not available. All server processors\n    (and most others) produced since 2015 support AVX2.\n  * crypto/ecdsa: The new ParseRawPrivateKey,\n    ParseUncompressedPublicKey, PrivateKey.Bytes, and\n    PublicKey.Bytes functions and methods implement low-level\n    encodings, replacing the need to use crypto/elliptic or\n    math/big functions and methods.\n  * crypto/ecdsa: When FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, signing is now\n    four times faster, matching the performance of non-FIPS mode.\n  * crypto/ed25519: When FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, signing is now\n    four times faster, matching the performance of non-FIPS mode.\n  * crypto/elliptic: The hidden and undocumented Inverse and\n    CombinedMult methods on some Curve implementations have been\n    removed.\n  * crypto/rsa: PublicKey no longer claims that the modulus value\n    is treated as secret. VerifyPKCS1v15 and VerifyPSS already\n    warned that all inputs are public and could be leaked, and\n    there are mathematical attacks that can recover the modulus\n    from other public values.\n  * crypto/rsa: Key generation is now three times faster.\n  * crypto/sha1: Hashing is now two times faster on amd64 when\n    SHA-NI instructions are available.\n  * crypto/sha3: The new SHA3.Clone method implements hash.Cloner.\n  * crypto/sha3: Hashing is now two times faster on Apple M\n    processors.\n  * crypto/tls: The new ConnectionState.CurveID field exposes the\n    key exchange mechanism used to establish the connection.\n  * crypto/tls: The new Config.GetEncryptedClientHelloKeys callback\n    can be used to set the EncryptedClientHelloKeys for a server to\n    use when a client sends an Encrypted Client Hello extension.\n  * crypto/tls: SHA-1 signature algorithms are now disallowed in\n    TLS 1.2 handshakes, per RFC 9155. They can be re-enabled with\n    the GODEBUG setting tlssha1=1.\n  * crypto/tls: When FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, Extended Master\n    Secret is now required in TLS 1.2, and Ed25519 and\n    X25519MLKEM768 are now allowed.\n  * crypto/tls: TLS servers now prefer the highest supported\n    protocol version, even if it isn’t the client’s most preferred\n    protocol version.\n  * crypto/tls: Both TLS clients and servers are now stricter in\n    following the specifications and in rejecting off-spec\n    behavior. Connections with compliant peers should be\n    unaffected.\n  * crypto/x509: CreateCertificate, CreateCertificateRequest, and\n    CreateRevocationList can now accept a crypto.MessageSigner\n    signing interface as well as crypto.Signer. This allows these\n    functions to use signers which implement “one-shot” signing\n    interfaces, where hashing is done as part of the signing\n    operation, instead of by the caller.\n  * crypto/x509: CreateCertificate now uses truncated SHA-256 to\n    populate the SubjectKeyId if it is missing. The GODEBUG setting\n    x509sha256skid=0 reverts to SHA-1.\n  * crypto/x509: ParseCertificate now rejects certificates which\n    contain a BasicConstraints extension that contains a negative\n    pathLenConstraint.\n  * crypto/x509: ParseCertificate now handles strings encoded with\n    the ASN.1 T61String and BMPString types more consistently. This\n    may result in some previously accepted malformed encodings now\n    being rejected.\n  * debug/elf: The debug/elf package adds two new constants:\n    PT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES and SHT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES for RISC-V ELF\n    parsing.\n  * go/ast: The FilterPackage, PackageExports, and\n    MergePackageFiles functions, and the MergeMode type and its\n    constants, are all deprecated, as they are for use only with\n    the long-deprecated Object and Package machinery.\n  * go/ast: The new PreorderStack function, like Inspect, traverses\n    a syntax tree and provides control over descent into subtrees,\n    but as a convenience it also provides the stack of enclosing\n    nodes at each point.\n  * go/parser: The ParseDir function is deprecated.\n  * go/token: The new FileSet.AddExistingFiles method enables\n    existing Files to be added to a FileSet, or a FileSet to be\n    constructed for an arbitrary set of Files, alleviating the\n    problems associated with a single global FileSet in long-lived\n    applications.\n  * go/types: Var now has a Var.Kind method that classifies the\n    variable as one of: package-level, receiver, parameter, result,\n    local variable, or a struct field.\n  * go/types: The new LookupSelection function looks up the field\n    or method of a given name and receiver type, like the existing\n    LookupFieldOrMethod function, but returns the result in the\n    form of a Selection.\n  * hash: The new XOF interface can be implemented by “extendable\n    output functions”, which are hash functions with arbitrary or\n    unlimited output length such as SHAKE.\n  * hash: Hashes implementing the new Cloner interface can return a\n    copy of their state. All standard library Hash implementations\n    now implement Cloner.\n  * hash/maphash: The new Hash.Clone method implements hash.Cloner.\n  * io/fs: A new ReadLinkFS interface provides the ability to read\n    symbolic links in a filesystem.\n  * log/slog: GroupAttrs creates a group Attr from a slice of Attr\n    values.\n  * log/slog: Record now has a Source method, returning its source\n    location or nil if unavailable.\n  * mime/multipart: The new helper function FileContentDisposition\n    builds multipart Content-Disposition header fields.\n  * net: LookupMX and Resolver.LookupMX now return DNS names that\n    look like valid IP address, as well as valid domain\n    names. Previously if a name server returned an IP address as a\n    DNS name, LookupMX would discard it, as required by the\n    RFCs. However, name servers in practice do sometimes return IP\n    addresses.\n  * net: On Windows, ListenMulticastUDP now supports IPv6\n    addresses.\n  * net: On Windows, it is now possible to convert between an\n    os.File and a network connection. Specifcally, the FileConn,\n    FilePacketConn, and FileListener functions are now implemented,\n    and return a network connection or listener corresponding to an\n    open file. Similarly, the File methods of TCPConn, UDPConn,\n    UnixConn, IPConn, TCPListener, and UnixListener are now\n    implemented, and return the underlying os.File of a network\n    connection.\n  * net/http: The new CrossOriginProtection implements protections\n    against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by rejecting non-safe\n    cross-origin browser requests. It uses modern browser Fetch\n    metadata, doesn’t require tokens or cookies, and supports\n    origin-based and pattern-based bypasses.\n  * os: On Windows, NewFile now supports handles opened for\n    asynchronous I/O (that is, syscall.FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED is\n    specified in the syscall.CreateFile call). These handles are\n    associated with the Go runtime’s I/O completion port, which\n    provides the following benefits for the resulting File: I/O\n    methods (File.Read, File.Write, File.ReadAt, and File.WriteAt)\n    do not block an OS thread. Deadline methods (File.SetDeadline,\n    File.SetReadDeadline, and File.SetWriteDeadline) are\n    supported. This enhancement is especially beneficial for\n    applications that communicate via named pipes on Windows. Note\n    that a handle can only be associated with one completion port\n    at a time. If the handle provided to NewFile is already\n    associated with a completion port, the returned File is\n    downgraded to synchronous I/O mode. In this case, I/O methods\n    will block an OS thread, and the deadline methods have no\n    effect.\n  * os: The filesystems returned by DirFS and Root.FS implement the\n    new io/fs.ReadLinkFS interface. CopyFS supports symlinks when\n    copying filesystems that implement io/fs.ReadLinkFS. The Root\n    type supports the following additional methods: Root.Chmod,\n    Root.Chown, Root.Chtimes, Root.Lchown, Root.Link,\n    Root.MkdirAll, Root.ReadFile, Root.Readlink, Root.RemoveAll,\n    Root.Rename, Root.Symlink, and Root.WriteFile.\n  * reflect: The new TypeAssert function permits converting a Value\n    directly to a Go value of the given type. This is like using a\n    type assertion on the result of Value.Interface, but avoids\n    unnecessary memory allocations.\n  * regexp/syntax: The \\p{name} and \\P{name} character class\n    syntaxes now accept the names Any, ASCII, Assigned, Cn, and LC,\n    as well as Unicode category aliases like \\p{Letter} for\n    \\pL. Following Unicode TR18, they also now use case-insensitive\n    name lookups, ignoring spaces, underscores, and hyphens.\n  * runtime: Cleanup functions scheduled by AddCleanup are now\n    executed concurrently and in parallel, making cleanups more\n    viable for heavy use like the unique package. Note that\n    individual cleanups should still shunt their work to a new\n    goroutine if they must execute or block for a long time to\n    avoid blocking the cleanup queue.\n  * runtime: A new GODEBUG=checkfinalizers=1 setting helps find\n    common issues with finalizers and cleanups, such as those\n    described in the GC guide. In this mode, the runtime runs\n    diagnostics on each garbage collection cycle, and will also\n    regularly report the finalizer and cleanup queue lengths to\n    stderr to help identify issues with long-running finalizers\n    and/or cleanups. See the GODEBUG documentation for more\n    details.\n  * runtime: The new SetDefaultGOMAXPROCS function sets GOMAXPROCS\n    to the runtime default value, as if the GOMAXPROCS environment\n    variable is not set. This is useful for enabling the new\n    GOMAXPROCS default if it has been disabled by the GOMAXPROCS\n    environment variable or a prior call to GOMAXPROCS.\n  * runtime/pprof: The mutex profile for contention on\n    runtime-internal locks now correctly points to the end of the\n    critical section that caused the delay. This matches the\n    profile’s behavior for contention on sync.Mutex values. The\n    runtimecontentionstacks setting for GODEBUG, which allowed\n    opting in to the unusual behavior of Go 1.22 through 1.24 for\n    this part of the profile, is now gone.\n  * sync: The new WaitGroup.Go method makes the common pattern of\n    creating and counting goroutines more convenient.\n  * testing: The new methods T.Attr, B.Attr, and F.Attr emit an\n    attribute to the test log. An attribute is an arbitrary key and\n    value associated with a test.\n  * testing: With the -json flag, attributes appear as a new “attr”\n    action.\n  * testing: The new Output method of T, B and F provides an\n    io.Writer that writes to the same test output stream as\n    TB.Log. Like TB.Log, the output is indented, but it does not\n    include the file and line number.\n  * testing: The AllocsPerRun function now panics if parallel tests\n    are running. The result of AllocsPerRun is inherently flaky if\n    other tests are running. The new panicking behavior helps catch\n    such bugs.\n  * testing/fstest: MapFS implements the new io/fs.ReadLinkFS\n    interface. TestFS will verify the functionality of the\n    io/fs.ReadLinkFS interface if implemented. TestFS will no\n    longer follow symlinks to avoid unbounded recursion.\n  * unicode: The new CategoryAliases map provides access to\n    category alias names, such as “Letter” for “L”.\n  * unicode: The new categories Cn and LC define unassigned\n    codepoints and cased letters, respectively. These have always\n    been defined by Unicode but were inadvertently omitted in\n    earlier versions of Go. The C category now includes Cn, meaning\n    it has added all unassigned code points.\n  * unique: The unique package now reclaims interned values more\n    eagerly, more efficiently, and in parallel. As a consequence,\n    applications using Make are now less likely to experience\n    memory blow-up when lots of truly unique values are interned.\n  * unique: Values passed to Make containing Handles previously\n    required multiple garbage collection cycles to collect,\n    proportional to the depth of the chain of Handle values. Now,\n    once unused, they are collected promptly in a single cycle.\n  * Darwin port: As announced in the Go 1.24 release notes, Go 1.25\n    requires macOS 12 Monterey or later. Support for previous\n    versions has been discontinued.\n  * Windows port: Go 1.25 is the last release that contains the\n    broken 32-bit windows/arm port (GOOS=windows GOARCH=arm). It\n    will be removed in Go 1.26.\n  * Loong64 port: The linux/loong64 port now supports the race\n    detector, gathering traceback information from C code using\n    runtime.SetCgoTraceback, and linking cgo programs with the\n    internal link mode.\n  * RISC-V port: The linux/riscv64 port now supports the plugin\n    build mode.\n  * RISC-V port: The GORISCV64 environment variable now accepts a\n    new value rva23u64, which selects the RVA23U64 user-mode\n    application profile.\n\nFixed during development:\n\n  * go#74466 bsc#1247719 security: fix CVE-2025-47906 os/exec: LookPath bug: incorrect expansion of '', '.' and '..' in some PATH configurations\n  * go#74831 bsc#1247720 security: fix CVE-2025-47907 database/sql: incorrect results returned from Rows.Scan\n\n  CVE-2025-4674\n  * go#74380 bsc#1246118 security: fix CVE-2025-4674 cmd/go: disable support for multiple vcs in one module\n\n",
