PED-12534\n  When this patchset was first added in 2013 (and rewritten over the years),\n  there was no upstream way to easily provide SLE customers with a way to build\n  container images based on SLE using the host subscription. However, with\n  docker-buildx you can now define secrets for builds (this is not entirely\n  transparent, but we can easily document this new requirement for SLE-16).\n  Users should use\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n  when doing their builds.\n- Now that the only blocker for docker-buildx support was removed for SLE-16,\n  enable docker-buildx for SLE-16 as well. PED-8905\n\n- Don't use the new container-selinux conditional requires on SLE-12, as the\n  RPM version there doesn't support it. Arguably the change itself is a bit\n  suspect but we can fix that later. bsc#1237367\n\n- Add backport for golang.org/x/oauth2 CVE-2025-22868 fix. bsc#1239185\n  + 0006-CVE-2025-22868-vendor-jws-split-token-into-fixed-num.patch\n- Add backport for golang.org/x/crypto CVE-2025-22869 fix. bsc#1239322\n  + 0007-CVE-2025-22869-vendor-ssh-limit-the-size-of-the-inte.patch\n- Refresh patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n\n- Make container-selinux requirement conditional on selinux-policy\n  (bsc#1237367)\n\nPackage python-kiwi was updated:\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.28 â 10.2.29\n- Fix return from repart stage\n  If we return from the repart stage it's important to wait\n  for the root device to appear. This is because the device\n  setup from udev might still be held back due to a former\n  lock on the device. This means if we return fast after\n  locking for example when check_repart_possible() quickly\n  finds out that it's not possible, then udev has not yet\n  got the time to create the device nodes.\n  This Fixes #2863\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.27 â 10.2.28\n\n- Fix dracut code to be POSIX compliant\n  The redirect type \u0026quot;\u0026lt; \u0026lt;(...)\u0026quot; is not POSIX complians and leads\n  to a syntax error in dracut which calls bash as \u0026quot;sh\u0026quot; leading\n  it to be restricted to POSIX only\n\n- Extend test-image-lvm integration test\n  For testing a bit more complex resize procedure, update\n  the lvm integration test to run more resize actions\n  with required device locking\n\n- Apply proper udev locking\n  Several commands during repart, resize and other actions\n  require a proper lock to be set for udev such that other\n  events knows about the locked state of a device and do\n  not mess with it until the command for which the lock\n  persists has completed. This commit applies proper udev\n  locks to all commands that requires it. In addition\n  incorrect code that was expected to prevent such race\n  conditions got dropped from the implementation.\n  This is related to bsc#1242987\n\n- relocate GPT at the end of disk using sfdisk\n  Using sfdisk for relocation and verification makes this\n  part more consistent. We also want to move away from gdisk.\n  This is related to #2851\n\n- Do not strictly require config.partids in repart\n  The kiwi-repart implementation requires a metadata file\n  named config.partids which holds information about\n  partition ids and more stored at the time the image was\n  built. Depending on the complexity of the image and the\n  resize request some of the information can be rebuilt\n  in case the metadata file is missing. This commit adds\n  the rebuild of the minimum required information to run\n  a standard resize and therefore allows the kiwi-repart\n  dracut module to work also without config.partids to be\n  present in the system\n\n- Do not drop /config.partids\n  The partition id metadata file is used in the kiwi-repart\n  module. If a user wants to use the kiwi repart module\n  permanently, this metadata file needs to stay in the system.\n  Therefore it should not be automatically deleted by the\n  cleanup. A disk.sh hook script can be used to force the\n  deletion of the file though. This is related #2851\n\n- Fix centos/test-image-live-disk-v10\n  There is no package named iprutils\n\n- Fix centos/test-image-live-disk-v10\n  Update package names\n\n- Added centos/test-image-live-disk-v10 build test\n\n- Fix tumbleweed/test-image-gce integration test\n  Drop obsolete growpart\n\n- Followup fix to support older apt versions for bootstrap\n  There are apt versions that do not create missing state files.\n  Make sure the intermediate bootstrap state file is created in\n  any case. This Fixes #2857\n\n- Fixed integration test builds\n  Next round of fixes for integration tests. Missing\n  or wrong service activations\n\n- Fix arm/tumbleweed/test-image-rpi\n  Fix snapper setup for this integration test\n\n- Fixed test-image-live-disk\n  Added missing openssh-server package\n\n- Fixed test-image-azure\n  Add missing python-azure-agent-config-default package\n\n- Fixed debian integration test builds\n  secure shell service is named ssh and not sshd there\n\n- Fixed integration test builds\n  Second round of fixes for integration tests. Again errors\n  now became visible due to the refactoring of the script code\n\n- Fixed integration test builds\n  Errors from scripts were no longer ignored due to the last\n  cleanup of the integration test script code. This commit\n  fixes the now exposed build errors\n\n- Fix check_target_dir_on_unsupported_filesystem\n  Find the first existing path in the target path and\n  check the filesystem capabilities for this path.\n  This Fixes #2858\n\n- Cleanup integration tests config.sh script code\n  Add script code to shellcheck and fix all reported issues.\n  Get rid of suseXX and baseXX methods as much as possible.\n  Add set -ex for all script code. Do not allow any script\n  code to fail.\n\n- defaults: Add patterns for shim/grub2 on riscv64\n  A recent commit changed the way these are looked up and\n  accidentally broke image building on riscv64, with\n  KiwiBootLoaderGrubSecureBootError: Signed grub2 efi loader not found\n  now being raised for kiwi recipes that worked just fine\n  before that moment.\n  Fixes: 197572378cf4f25103934beac2ceca4fbbcfcbc0\n  Thanks: David Abdurachmanov \u0026lt;davidlt@rivosinc.com\u0026gt;\n  Thanks: Marcus SchÃ¤fer \u0026lt;marcus.schaefer@gmail.com\u0026gt;\n  Signed-off-by: Andrea Bolognani \u0026lt;abologna@redhat.com\u0026gt;\n\n- Add SLFO test-image-disk-simple integration test\n  Add simple disk test and allow for testing the new\n  transparent container idea for the aws toolchain. also\n  add SLFO builds to the helper script\n\n- Fixed check for unallocated space on disk\n  So far the check for unallocated space was only working for GPT\n  and there it was also not really stable. The check was based on\n  verifying if the backup GPT table is really at the end of the\n  disk. Depending on which tool was used to dump the image on the\n  target this \u0026quot;mistake\u0026quot; often got corrected by the tools that\n  dumped the image. In this case the check no longer worked.\n  This commit improves the check by another test which looks\n  for the real free bytes on disk compared to the current\n  partition geometry.\n\n- Move to neutral directory for calling osc\n  When calling the helper/build_status.sh script to get an\n  overview about the results of the integration tests, there\n  is a stupid new behavior from the osc tool that it assumes\n  a package name according to the name of the directory you\n  are in probably connected to the fact that the data in this\n  directory is a git checkout or some other strange assumption.\n  This commit moves to a neutral directory where none of the\n  osc internal assumptions applies and it just does what it\n  should do... showing results of the given project.\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.26 â 10.2.27\n\n- Fix regression in get_partition_node_name\n  backwards compat for lsblk before 2.38\n  if START column not supported, fall back to default sort\n\n- Add global option --setenv\n  Allow to set environment variables in the caller environment\n  via the commandline, e.g --setenv SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=42\n\n- Seed filesystem UUIDs with SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH\n  For reproducible builds the calculation of the filesystem UUID\n  should be persistent with each rebuild of the image. To achieve\n  this the UUID is calculated using the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH from\n  the environment plus a char-number representation of the filesystem\n  label name as random seed. In kiwi every filesystem is created\n  with a label, thus only in case there is no SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH\n  available we continue to create the UUID as random data.\n  This Fixes #2761\n\n- Add label attribute for \u0026lt;partition\u0026gt; section\n  Allow to specify a filesystem label as part of a \u0026lt;partition\u0026gt;\n  definition. So far the label was set by the name of the\n  partition. With the new label attribute, a filesystem label\n  different from the partition name can be set. This commit\n  also updates/fixes the documentation in this regard.\n\n- Improve log message in SystemIdentifier\n  Add some scope information such that we know from where\n  this log information originates from.\n\n- Add rd.kiwi.install.devicepersistency\n  Allow to specify which type of persistent device name should\n  be used to build up the list of installation disk devices.\n  For example rd.kiwi.install.devicepersistency=by-path would\n  use the by-path representations for the available disk\n  devices. The default (by-id) stays untouched. In case an\n  invalid or not present device representation is selected, kiwi\n  falls back to the non persistent unix node names.\n\n- Update test-image-disk\n  Add NetworkManager for better remote debugging capabilities\n\n- Make mbr-id deterministic\n  Log the value of SDE so it is available to review,\n  even if the build system does not tell about it.\n  Update the tests to cover the new code-path.\n  Co-Authored-By: Marcus SchÃ¤fer \u0026lt;marcus.schaefer@gmail.com\u0026gt;\n\n- Ensure dracut initrd is reproducible\n  This helps a bit with issue #2358\n  Add reproducible flag for UKI too\n  Update tests accordingly\n  Co-Authored-By: Marcus SchÃ¤fer \u0026lt;marcus.schaefer@gmail.com\u0026gt;\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.25 â 10.2.26\n\n- Add kernel parameter support for dm-verity options\n  Implement rd.kiwi.verity_options= parameter to allow runtime customization of veritysetup options\n  Closes #2837\n\n- Fix shim lookup for arm on SUSE\n  Add missing search path for shim binary on arm based SUSE\n  systems. Also update the tumbleweed/test-image-live-disk\n  integration test for arm to build with secure boot enabled\n  to actually test a secure boot enabled ISO build.\n  This Fixes #2842\n\n- Add container_import template test\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.24 â 10.2.25\n\n- Fixed get_partition_node_name\n  The function get_partition_node_name takes the disk device\n  and the partition index as arguments to match against the\n  respective device node for this partition index. The partition\n  index is the position of the partition in the partition table\n  according to their start offset. For the code to function\n  properly it is required that the list of partitions provided\n  by lsblk is ordered according to the start address of the\n  partitions in the table. The way lsblk was called did not\n  enforce this ordering. This commit enforces the order to\n  be done against the start offset and fixes bsc#1245190\n\n- Add support for container-snap as a container-image engine\n  With this commit, we can now pre-load images using container-snap directly\n  during the kiwi image build\n\n- Update test-image-MicroOS for local build\n  Fix bootstrap setup such that micro-os patterns can resolve\n\n- Fix logging of stderr data in command calls\n  The stderr data was presented as one blob without line\n  breaks. Hard to read and smells like a bug. This commit\n  fixes the output to become readable\n\n- Update test-image-MicroOS/disk.sh\n  Add a findmnt for / to check if there is a proper root\n  device reference\n\n- Fix mount system for root_is_snapper_snapshot\n  If root is a snapper snapshot we have to tell the\n  chroot a proper root mount point which can be achieved\n  by a bind mount pointing to itself. This Fixes\n  bsc#1244668\n\n- There is no shim for aarch64 on SUSE\n  Fix integration test for standard EFI (no secure boot)\n  setup on arm\n\n- Add driver configuration support for dracut initrd\n  Add driver configuration support for dracut initrd\n  Add support for specifying kernel drivers to be included or omitted\n  in the dracut initrd configuration. This extends the existing dracut\n  configuration capabilities like in the following example\n  \u0026lt;initrd action=\u0026quot;add\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;dracut driver=\u0026quot;erofs\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;/initrd\u0026gt;\n\n- Fixed rootfs size calculation with spare part\n  In case a spare_part setup is combined with the root_clone feature,\n  the size calculation for the rootfs did not take the cloning into\n  account and lead to the wrong value. In addition when requesting\n  the spare part to be last and no size information was given, the\n  partition was not created at all. This commit fixes both defects\n  and Fixes #2831\n\n- Add dependency for isomd5sum for iso images and set in kiwi-settings\n  This ensures that isomd5sum is pulled into the environment for ISO image\n  builds, and the updated settings makes it so that kiwi boxes will use it.\n\n- Allow /boot to be a btrfs subvolume\n  In a btrfs based design, allow to put /boot as subvolume.\n  This required a small fix in the mount order in a way that\n  boot/efi gets mounted after the subvolume mounts are done.\n  The respective integration test has been updated to test\n  this functionality. This Fixes #2824\n\n- Use f-strings where feasible\n  This is a slightly shorter and easier to read syntax\n\n- Allow multiple EFI arch binaries/modules\n  Allow to lookup and included EFI binaries/modules for\n  multiple architectures. For testing the integration\n  test in rawhide/test-image-live-disk has been adapted\n  accordingly to install 32bit and 64bit EFI binaries.\n  This Fixes #2822\n\n- Log warning message for disabled runtime checks\n  Complete type hints for RuntimeConfig class and log\n  a warning message for each disabled runtime check\n\n- Fix static type argument int vs. str\n\n- Move it inside the context that actually uses it\n  also rename it to \u0026quot;supported\u0026quot; as that seems to closer match\n  what it resembles\n\n- Add overlayfs as supporting xattr/ACLs as well\n\n- Fix disk_type validation for zipl loader\n  If the targettype is set to GPT in combination with plain\n  zipl as loader, the code to validate the targettype against\n  the targetgeometry was not effective and zipl failed.\n  This Fixes #2821\n\n- Fixup overlay unit enablement\n\n- Fixup overlay mount dependencies\n\n- Update test-image-overlayroot integration test\n  Use proper systemd mount units to setup the custom overlay.\n  The handling of fstab entries by systemd is limited and\n  should be better handled by self managed mount units\n\n- Use proper mount units for overlay setup\n  Instead of manual mounting create a proper systemd mount\n  unit. This allows to manage mount dependencies and the order\n  of nested mounts in a clean way\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.23 â 10.2.24\n\n- Cleanup build metadata\n  Make sure the final image rootfs does not contain unneeded\n  metadata files used during build time. The respective cleanup\n  call is performed after the root sync and after all initrd/boot\n  processing has been done. This is because up to that point it's\n  still possible that the information is required. This means\n  when building images with a read-only rootfs, it might not be\n  possible that the metadata can be deleted due to a chicken\u0026amp;egg\n  situation. Furthermore the cleanup is applied to the disk\n  builder only as other builders do not really suffer from\n  this data and for the container builder the metadata can\n  also be used for the stackbuild feature when building images\n  derived from containers. This Fixes #2668\n\n- Update overlay integration test for partial write\n  Update the sdboot_uki_verity_erofs profile of the\n  test-image-overlayroot integration test with a custom\n  fstab example to overlay only parts of the system\n  for writing. This Fixes #2815\n\n- bootloader setup without overlay write partition\n  If overlayroot_write_partition=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; is set, no system\n  indicator was stored. This cause the bootloader setup to\n  be skipped completely which is not required for e.g.\n  systemd-boot.\n\n- Make sure to create overlay directories\n  Create overlay directories even if rd.root.overlay.readonly\n  is set. This allows individual fstab overlays mounts to be\n  performed\n\n- Fixed rd.root.overlay.readonly overlay mode\n  When booting an overlayroot image with rd.root.overlay.readonly\n  set, the system will boot with only the read-only root mounted.\n  There was a bug in the dracut code which prevented this mount\n  from succeeding when the read-only rootfs is different from\n  squashfs. This commit changes the mount to be a simple bind\n  mount, independent of the origin filesystem. This works because\n  the read-only mount is performed in the dracut overlay code\n  anyway. This is related to Issue #2815\n\n- The way we build debs requires setuptools\n  debbuild doesn't work when setuptools is not there\n\n- Drop use of setuptools\n  Since we moved to poetry and no code using setuptools anymore,\n  this requirement can be dropped. The commit also updates the\n  plugin documentation which was still based on setup.py\n\n- Update live boot remote boot features\n  Like the upstream module also support the root=live:http://...\n  remote boot options. The kiwi-live dracut module is scheduled\n  to become obsolete, but it's still in use and should support\n  remote boot not only for AoE. As we got more issue reports than\n  working AoE remote boot success, this commit also updates the\n  documentation and switches to the capabilities of this PR.\n\n- Add UKI support for the grub bootloader\n  In addition to systemd_boot also add support for UKI creation\n  when grub is used. This includes the creation of a UKI image\n  via dracut in the same way as it's done for systemd_boot.\n  In addition an earlyboot grub script chainloads the UKI and\n  bypasses any written grub configuration. In Theory this should\n  also allow to use the shim loader for chainloading an UKI.\n  However I haven't done testing in this direction and I also\n  expect security issues with this approach because loading\n  any non signed data by shim is not expected to work. A new\n  profile named grub_uki_verity_erofs has been added to the\n  integration test that experiments with UKIs\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.22 â 10.2.23\n\n- Add support for \u0026lt;initrd\u0026gt; section as part of \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;\n  Extend scope and content of the \u0026lt;initrd\u0026gt; section to be allowed\n  as part of the \u0026lt;type\u0026gt; section. This allows to specify custom\n  call options and modules for the dracut tool. In particular\n  this commit implementes support for passing the uefi option\n  to dracut to enable building an UKI EFI binary as follows:\n  \u0026lt;initrd action=\u0026quot;setup\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;dracut uefi=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;/initrd\u0026gt;\n  This Fixes #2809 and Fixes #2408\n\n- Fix systemd-boot loader setup\n  To make sure only loader entries from /boot/efi/loader/entries\n  kiwi deleted eventually existing entry files from /boot/loader.\n  However that is a problem for read-only systems and should actually\n  also not performed by kiwi. This Fixes #2805\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.21 â 10.2.22\n\n- Apply security context on writable root only\n  Make sure to perform setfiles only on a writable target. In case\n  of a read-only root it is expected that the security context set\n  by kiwi in an earlier stage is complete. As there is no way to\n  modify data when root is read-only, there is also no way to change\n  the security context of any file such that we skip setfiles\n  in this case. Should there be a read-only system that has writable\n  partitions such as /boot and their content changes while the rest\n  of the root system is read-only it is in the responsibility of\n  the author of the image description to call setfiles only on\n  the affected and still writable files via a custom disk.sh\n  script. Along with the fix the respective integration test was\n  modified to enable selinux such that this change is actually\n  integration tested. This Fixes #2805\n\n- Docs: fix typo in users.rst\n\n- Docs: minor punctuation and grammar fixes\n\n- Give test-image-overlayroot enough space\n\n- Allow ext2/ext3 as valid build target\n  stat reports the value 'ext2/ext3' which is a valid target\n\n- Added check_target_dir_on_unsupported_filesystem\n  Add runtime check to make sure the selected target directory\n  for the image and/or the image rootfs lives on a filesystem\n  that provides all required features like extended permissions,\n  ACLs or xattrs.\n\n- Fix rd.kiwi.oem.luks.reencrypt_randompass workflow\n  When requesting a new random key prior reencryption, make\n  sure that this new key is referenced in the current in\n  memory initrd crypttab such that all subsequent\n  tasks e.g. luks resize have permissions to complete while\n  inside of this initrd instance\n\n- Add support for new tarball-based WSL format\n  With the new image=\u0026quot;wsl\u0026quot; type one can build a WSL container\n  image that uses the new tarball format. This Fixes #2678\n\n- Update SL-Micro build test\n  For details see: https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1272418\n\n- Required read-only-root-fs for SL-Micro test build\n  Changes from the SL-Micro team requires adaptions to the\n  integration test description\n\n- Delete fstab.script from SL-Micro test build\n  This was only needed when /var was an extra partition, but\n  it's a volume with copy-on-write disabled for some time\n\n- Add systemd-resolved to TW integration tests\n  For some reason it's not longer part of the systemd standard\n  installation\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.20 â 10.2.21\n\n- Add dkms to test-image-embedded integration test\n\n- Fixed access issue to etc/kernel for sdboot\n  In case of an overlayroot setup we have to make sure\n  that etc/kernel is writable. This is done by a bind\n  mount of the ESP\n\n- Update test-image-overlayroot\n  Add another build using grub instead of systemd-boot and use\n  btrfs as write partition instead of xfs. Please note this test\n  requires a boot partition because grub cannot read from erofs\n  and unlike systemd-boot grub does not read all boot data from\n  the ESP.\n\n- Fixed get_volume_management\n  If a volume capable filesystem like btrfs is requested, there\n  must also be a volume definition available to report that\n  the volume management is actively used. Just the request of\n  the filesystem can also mean it's being used without volumes\n  like it could be the case for an overlayroot setup that\n  requests btrfs as write partition.\n\n- Update test-image-overlayroot\n  Move to systemd-boot as bootloader, activate secure boot\n  and drop the extra boot partition. Use XFS for the write\n  space\n\n- Allow initrd updates on read-only devices\n  Move initrd to ESP for boot loaders that reads data\n  from there\n\n- Fix ordering issue for device assignment\n  wrong assignment of a boot partition in overlayroot setup\n  without boot partition\n\n- Add kiwi-settings package for TW\n  de-blacklist erofs to allow building integration tests\n  with this filesystem\n\n- Switch to dracut-kiwi-verity\n  So far no luck with the systemd verity generator. This\n  commit adds the parsing of /etc/veritytab in the existing\n  kiwi-verity dracut module and uses it in the overlayroot\n  integration test.\n\n- Update test-image-overlayroot integration test\n  Switch to erofs for overlay testing. Additionally split the build\n  into two profiles. The first one just builds a simple overlayroot\n  oem disk based on erofs. The second one adds a veritysetup layer\n  and configures the systemd-veritysetup-generator for use in dracut.\n  This Fixes #2799\n\n- Add documentation for new attribute\n  Add details how to use the new overlayroot_readonly_filesystem attribute\n\n- Add support for selecting the overlay read-only fs\n  Add new overlayroot_readonly_filesystem attribute which allows\n  to select for either squashfs or erofs as the read-only filesystem\n  in an OEM overlay disk setup.\n\n- Fixed root setup for verity overlay disk\n  When building an image with overlayroot set to true and\n  activated verity data, the root= parameter must be\n  set to root=overlay:MAPPER=verityroot instead of the standard\n  overlay:PARTUUID mapping.\n\n- Make sure the verity record has a superblock\n\n- Drop distro specific runtime check\n  The check_efi_mode_for_disk_overlay_correctly_setup exists because\n  shim-install does not work on read-only devices. However, shim-install\n  is a SUSE only tool that runs a SUSE specific secure boot setup.\n  For other secure boot processes this runtime check is not useful.\n  As runtime checks aims to be generally useful, this one gets\n  dropped.\n\n- Fix root clone size setup\n  If the root_clone attribute is specified without providing a\n  fixed size for the system, kiwi estimates the size needed for\n  the root part and assigns the rest to the clone. This leads to\n  different partition sizes for the root clones. As per definition\n  of a clone the expectation is that the size is the same, this\n  commit changes the behavior such that the calculated size for\n  the system is applied to the origin root and all its clones.\n  As a consequence this can leave unpartitioned space free in\n  the image. This Fixes #2463\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.19 â 10.2.20\n\n- Fix reencryption master key passphrase\n  Make sure to use the correct passphrase for the master\n  key such that it can be decrypted with the same credentials\n  as before. The credentials reset is a subsequent task\n  after reencryption.\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.18 â 10.2.19\n\n- Fixed targettype setup in zipl.conf\n  The special targettype set to GPT still indicates SCSI for\n  the zipl.conf but tells kiwi to create a GPT disk layout\n\n- Fixed s390 integration test\n  targettype attribute in wrong section\n\n- Add support for GPT targettype on s390\n  Allow to build s390 images using GPT instead of the old DOS\n  partition table. zipl has added support to read from GPT.\n  This Fixes #2694\n\n- Add --no-compress option to bundler\n  Allow to skip the compression for bundle files marked\n  to become compressed. This Fixes #2736\n\n- Rawhide (F43) has removed basesystem package\n  The basesystem package was retired with rawhide (F43).\n  https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/filesystem/pull-request/20\n\n- rawhide install shadow-utils for usermod\n  Using `kiwi-ng` version 10.2.18 (EL9)\n  Currently with:\n  ```\n  sudo kiwi-ng system build \\\n  - -description kiwi/build-tests/x86/fedora/test-image-docker\n  - -set-repo http://ftp.fau.de/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/Everything/x86_64/os/ \\\n  - -target-dir /tmp/myimage1\n  ```\n  This fails with:\n  ```\n  [ INFO    ]: 09:46:38 | Setting up user root\n  [ INFO    ]: 09:46:38 | --\u0026gt; Modifying user: root\n  [ INFO    ]: 09:46:38 | --\u0026gt; Primary group for user root: root\n  [ ERROR   ]: 09:46:38 | KiwiCommandError: chroot: stderr: /sbin/chroot: failed to run command âusermodâ: No such file or directory\n  ```\n  Install the package `shadow-utils` to provide `usermod`.\n\n- Fixed default bls value setup\n  Fixed get_build_type_bootloader_bls behavior in case the bls\n  attribute is not set. In this case get_bls() returns a None value\n  which was returned. However in this case the attribute value\n  should not be taken into account and the method defined default\n  value for bls should be returned. This Fixes #2542\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.17 â 10.2.18\n\n- Fix setup of use_disk_password for random secret\n  When using luks=\u0026quot;random\u0026quot; in combination with use_disk_password=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;\n  the resulting cryptomount call in grub is wrong. This commit fixes it\n\n- Drop copying GRUB2 modules to /boot with Secure Boot UEFI images\n  Copying the modules creates a situation where future updates\n  applied to a running system can cause GRUB to crash due to mixed\n  modules and GRUB EFI binaries.\n  It is not needed anyway since GRUB EFI binaries for Secure Boot have\n  all modules compiled into the binaries.\n  Fixes: https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/issues/2790\n\n- Make sure editbootinstall runs offline\n  editbootinstall expects the system to be umounted\n\n- Make sure post sync actions are in scope\n\n- Follow up fix for overlayroot builds for EFI path\n  Only perform the boot overlay if there is an extra boot partition\n\n- Only remove entries from exclude list if present\n\n- Fix overlayroot builds for EFI path\n  make sure to keep boot/efi mountpoint directories\n  in the read-only area as they can't be created later\n\n- doc: overview: Add list of supported Linux distributions\n  These are the Linux distributions that are developed and actively\n  tested for with the latest kiwi releases.\n  This should offer greater clarity about what we're able to support\n  as an upstream project.\n\n- Fixed mount of image system for volume managers\n  The ImageSystem.mount() method implemented its own handling\n  for mounting the volumes of a volume manager based system.\n  First and foremost this duplicates code that already exists\n  in the respective VolumeManager implementation and second\n  the code behaved wrong in case of btrfs when there is no\n  default subvolume configured\n\n- Handle grub fix functions less strict\n  If called on full read-only systems, log the information\n  that the files can't be modified but do not fail. On\n  such systems the expectation is that no fix code must\n  be applied and as such the fix function can be considered\n  an optional step.\n\n- Fixed root setup for encrypted overlay disk\n  When building an image with overlayroot set to true and\n  activated luks encryption, the root= parameter must be\n  set to root=overlay:MAPPER=luks instead of the standard\n  overlay:PARTUUID mapping. This Fixes #2776\n\n- Change suffix for package manager config files\n  Use .config instead of .conf for the temporary package\n  manager config files. Reason for this change is a bug in\n  dracut which reads and executes all /*.conf files from\n  the system. This Fixes #2780\n\n- Set security context after root sync\n  On selinux enabled image builds we call setfiles initially\n  after the root tree is complete and after each script invocation\n  that might change the system. However the security context\n  also applies to mount points e.g volumes which only exists\n  at the time when the root tree gets synced to the actual image\n  binary. Thus this commit also calls setfiles on the mounted\n  root tree after data sync. This Fixes rh#2333743\n\n- Fix broken doc link\n  Rephrase chapter pointing to a documentation side at VMware.\n  They are constantly changing their documentation URLs that\n  I'm tired of fixing this. This Fixes #2782\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.16 â 10.2.17\n\n- Fix key slot selection for luks reencrypt\n  Depending on the type setup for a luks encrypted image, there\n  might be one or two key slots available. When kiwi is requested\n  to perform the reencryption process at least one key-slot and\n  the proper keyfile/passphrase must be provided. This commit\n  stores the information about the key-slot number for which\n  a decryption information exists in the initrd. In addition to\n  the code change also the corresponding integration test image\n  was updated.\n\n- Fixed test-image-gce integration test\n  python3-gcemetadata was renamed to python-gcemetadata\n\n- Fixed integration test builds for TW\n  Request dracut explicitly when needed\n\n- Add support for filtering out files from the ESP image for GRUB\n  Prior to this change, KIWI blindly synced the ESP directory into the\n  embedded ESP image. Depending on the distribution and packages included\n  for the created image, this can have undesirable side-effects.\n  For image builds that need some more fine-grained control over the\n  creation of the embedded ESP image (particularly for ISO images),\n  this change introduces the ability to inject an exclusion list\n  similar to what is used to filter out files for the root filesystem.\n  Fixes: https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/issues/2008\n  Fixes: https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/issues/2777\n\n- Fix bundle extension for container types\n  When building result files that use container types like oci or docker,\n  kiwi creates them as archive tarballs with an extension prefix to\n  indicate the special nature of the archive. However, the bundler\n  code does not retain the prefix, which results in the wrong file\n  extension for these archives.\n  This change adds exceptions for these types and refactors the\n  exception handling to unify it with the Vagrant image filename\n  handling, which operates similarly.\n  Fixes: https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/issues/2628\n\n- Update LOADER_TYPE setup for grub\n  If the bootloader attribute: bls is set to true, make sure\n  the LOADER_TYPE changes to grub2-bls. This is related to\n  Issue #2773\n\n- Fix Agama PXE build\n  A bootloader setup is needed to create config.bootoptions\n  Even though a ramdisk deployment does not require a bootloader\n  setup we need it because part of the setup is the root device\n  reference which is still needed to pivot root into the\n  system\n\n- Fix firmware setting for Agama PXE image\n\n- Added obs BUILD_FLAVOR for agama\n  Required for multibuild (multiple profiles) build\n\n- Update Agama integration test\n  Split the build into two profiles ISO and PXE to differentiate\n  the build results into a small Agama for remote installations\n  and a standard Agama for iso based installations\n\n- Prevent loading unused data in oem deployment\n  In case rd.kiwi.ramdisk is used as part of a remote deployment\n  setup, it's not needed to load the system kernel and initrd\n  because it's not used as kexec is not called with the system\n  deployed into memory. For ramdisk deployments the system is\n  booted using the currently active kernel and initrd and as\n  such we can avoid loading an extra kernel and initrd for\n  booting the system via kexec.\n\n- Update Agama integration test\n  Make use of \u0026lt;oem-ramdisk-size\u0026gt; in the Agama integration test\n\n- Added \u0026lt;oem-ramdisk-size\u0026gt; element\n  So far it was only possible to specify the size of the ramdisk\n  via the kernel commandline option: ramdisk_size. In a remote\n  deployment it was therefore required to carry this size as a\n  mandatory information to the deployment server. With this commit\n  we allow to specify the size for the ramdisk to be configured as\n  part of the image configuration which makes this information\n  also available inside of the initrd. If provided the ramdisk_size\n  kernel commandline option still takes precedence over the\n  \u0026lt;oem-ramdisk-size\u0026gt; setting to avoid any behavior change and to\n  still allow dynamic overrides of the ramdisk size.\n\n- reinstall bootstrap packs in image phase for apt\n  Due to the special bootstrap process, the packages unpacked\n  during bootstrap are not properly listed in the apt index.\n  Therefore the bootstrap packages are added to the install\n  phase which causes an install of this packages again to\n  fix the apt index and provide a consistent system from\n  an apt perspective. This Fixes #2768\n\n- Fixed restore of keyfile after reencryption\n  When kiwi runs the reencryption it also restores an eventual\n  existing keyfile. However if the option rd.kiwi.oem.luks.reencrypt_randompass\n  is specified no former keyfile should be restored. The purpose\n  of reencrypt_randompass is to make sure only this in memory\n  passphrase can access the luks pool such that tooling at boot\n  time gets the opportunity to work with the luks pool for e.g.\n  setting up a TPM key or set a passphrase only known to the user.\n\n- Update dracut kiwi-lib module setup\n  Make sure all tools used in code are requested for inclusion\n\n- keep /usr/bin/sha256sum\n  dropping md5sum was okay, but now we need\n  the current tool to verify the checksum\n\n- Restrict keyfile permissions\n  For reencrypt in combination with rd.kiwi.oem.luks.reencrypt_randompass\n  make sure that the temporary random pass keyfile has 0400 root\n  owned access permissions set\n\n- package: Add kiwi-image:oci Provides to -systemdeps-containers\n  This allows the Open Build Service to correctly resolve dependencies\n  when building OCI images.\n\n- Better logging which kiwi file is read\n  Improve the log message that tells about reading the\n  kiwi config file to actually show the file path that\n  is read in. This is especially an issue if more than\n  one kiwi file is read in during the build process.\n\n- also keep the ts binary, might be needed to provide timestamped logfiles\n\n- Update documentation\n  Add information about new apk (Alpine) support\n\n- Add support for Alpine\n  Add apk repository and package manager support and provide\n  an integration test build for the Alpine distribution\n\n- Fix F824 flake check for global assignments\n\n- Use metalink repos for local test builds\n\n- schema: Allow C as a valid locale\n  It should be permitted to set the \u0026quot;C.UTF-8\u0026quot; locale for minimal images\n  that are not preloaded with locales. The \u0026quot;C.UTF-8\u0026quot; locale has been\n  supported in Linux distributions for many years.\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.15 â 10.2.16\n\n- Support sourcetype setting on the commandline\n  Allow to specifiy the sourcetype(metalink|baseurl|mirrorlist)\n  also on the commandline via --set-repo/--add-repo options. So\n  far this was only possible as part of the kiwi description file\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.14 â 10.2.15\n\n- Fix gh-pages deployment\n  poetry install was not called, thus sphinx was not present\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.13 â 10.2.14\n\n- Drop use of travis-sphinx\n  According to the documentation of peaceiris/actions-gh-pages\n  the sphinx-build output can be directly consumed to publish\n  to github pages\n\n- Allow stderr data in CommandProcess\n  Enhance poll_show_progress() method to allow polling on\n  stderr data too. The new parameter with_stderr is used\n  together with the dnf5 package manager. dnf5 has changed\n  in a way that a lot of useful information during the\n  install of packages is printed to stderr. From my perspective\n  a clear regression to former behavior but we can fix this\n  in kiwi to poll on both channels. This Fixes #2748\n\n- Support arch attribute for \u0026lt;users\u0026gt; section\n  Allow to setup users per arch. This Fixes #2737\n\n- Add Debian_12_update repo for testing with typer\n  Even though we will add support for the typer Cli with kiwi-11\n  I want our integration test images to be able to build with the\n  open PR #2751. Debian 12 is the only target in the support matrix\n  which uses a too old veryion of typer. Therefore to be able to\n  test this target I built a newer version of typer in an update\n  repo for Debian 12 and added it to the integration test\n  description\n\n- Fixed python3_sitelib for debbuild in OBS\n\n- Fixed test-image-agama\n  Service setup-systemd-proxy-env.path no longer exists\n\n- Explicitly request shadow-utils\n  Make sure shadow-utils gets installed for rawhide\n  integration tests\n\n- Drop test-image-suse-on-dnf test\n  This was just a \u0026quot;can this work\u0026quot; test but has no real\n  relevance for users since nobody would use dnf to build\n  a suse image, there is also no help when it does not\n  work. So let's drop this test build\n\n- distutils sysconfig is deprecated\n  Move to sysconfig module\n\n- Make integration tests to build outside of OBS\n  Update and extend all integration tests such that they also\n  build outside of the Open Build Service. Along with the changes\n  on the descriptions a simple build-tests.sh script was added\n  to drive the build process. The build is based on the kiwi\n  boxbuild plugin in container mode to build the tests\n  from a given build-tests directory. A new chapter to document\n  how to Build the Build Tests is also provided and referenced\n  on the github main page.\n\n- Add rd.kiwi.oem.luks.reencrypt_randompass\n  For OEM LUKS2 encrypted disk images in combination\n  with rd.kiwi.oem.luks.reencrypt. Reset insecure built time\n  passphrase with a random onetime passphrase\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.12 â 10.2.13\n\n- Lookup CHRP loader instead of using a static name\n  On ppc the CHRP loader name can vary between distributions.\n  This commit adds a search method to lookup different ELF\n  loader names. In addition an integration test image for\n  Fedora was added. This Fixes #2741\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2025-4373.patch: carefully handle gssize parameters  (bsc#1242844 CVE-2025-4373 glgo#GNOME/glib#3677).\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2025-3360.patch:\n  Backport 8d60d7dc from upstream, Fix integer overflow when\n  parsing very long ISO8601 inputs. This will only happen with\n  invalid (or maliciously invalid) potential ISO8601 strings,\n  but `g_date_time_new_from_iso8601()` needs to be robust against\n  that.\n  (CVE-2025-3360, bsc#1240897)\n\n- Have the glib2-tools postun trigger exit normally if\n  glib2-compile-schemas can't be run.

During this operation, genksyms\n  is invoked for each source file. The tool determines type signatures of\n  all exports within the file, reports any differences compared to the\n  associated symref reference, calculates symbol CRCs from the signatures\n  and writes new type data into a symtypes file.\n  * The script rpm/modversions is invoked again, this time it packs all new\n  symtypes files to a consolidated kABI file.\n  * The downstream script rpm/kabi.pl checks symbol CRCs in the new build and\n  compares them to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking\n  kabi/severities into account.\n  suse-kabi-tools is a new set of tools to improve the kABI checking process.\n  The suite includes two tools, ksymtypes and ksymvers, which replace the\n  existing scripts rpm/modversions and rpm/kabi.pl, as well as the comparison\n  functionality previously provided by genksyms. The tools have their own\n  source repository and package.\n  The tools provide faster operation and more detailed, unified output. In\n  addition, they allow the use of the new upstream tool gendwarfksyms, which\n  lacks any built-in comparison functionality.\n  The updated workflow is as follows:\n  * The build performs a regular kernel make. During this operation, genksyms\n  (gendwarfksyms) is invoked as usual, determinining signatures and CRCs of\n  all exports and writing the type data to symtypes files. However,\n  genksyms no longer performs any comparison.\n  * 'ksymtypes consolidate' packs all new symtypes files to a consolidated\n  kABI file.\n  * 'ksymvers compare' checks symbol CRCs in the new build and compares them\n  to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking kabi/severities\n  into account. The tool writes its result in a human-readable form on\n  standard output and also writes a list of all changed exports (not\n  ignored by kabi/severities) to the changed-exports file.\n  * 'ksymtypes compare' takes the changed-exports file, the consolidated kABI\n  symtypes reference data from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symtypes-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt; and the new\n  consolidated data. Based on this data, it produces a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols changed.\n  The patch enables the use of suse-kabi-tools via rpm/config.sh, providing\n  explicit control to each branch. To enable the support, set\n  USE_SUSE_KABI_TOOLS=Yes in the config file.\n- commit a2c6f89\n\n- rpm/kernel-source.changes.old: Drop bogus bugzilla reference (bsc#1244725)\n- commit 5432961\n\n-

An\n  alternative to package links is multibuild. However, for multibuild\n  packages package meta cannot be used to set which spec file gets built.\n  Use prjcon buildflags instead, and remove this conditional.

Square brackets\n    are only valid for IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts according to RFC\n    3986 Section 3.2.2 (bsc#1236705, CVE-2025-0938,\n    gh#python/cpython#105704).\n  - gh-121284: Fix bug in the folding of rfc2047 encoded-words\n    when flattening an email message using a modern email\n    policy. Previously when an encoded-word was too long for\n    a line, it would be decoded, split across lines, and\n    re-encoded. But commas and other special characters in the\n    original text could be left unencoded and unquoted. This\n    could theoretically be used to spoof header lines using a\n    carefully constructed encoded-word if the resulting rendered\n    email was transmitted or re-parsed.\n  - gh-80222: Fix bug in the folding of quoted strings\n    when flattening an email message using a modern email\n    policy. Previously when a quoted string was folded so that\n    it spanned more than one line, the surrounding quotes and\n    internal escapes would be omitted. This could theoretically\n    be used to spoof header lines using a carefully constructed\n    quoted string if the resulting rendered email was transmitted\n    or re-parsed.\n  - gh-119511: Fix a potential denial of service in the imaplib\n    module. When connecting to a malicious server, it could\n    cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. On many\n    systems this is harmless as unused virtual memory is only\n    a mapping, but if this hit a virtual address size limit\n    it could lead to a MemoryError or other process crash. On\n    unusual systems or builds where all allocated memory is\n    touched and backed by actual ram or storage it couldâve\n    consumed resources doing so until similarly crashing.\n  - gh-127257: In ssl, system call failures that OpenSSL reports\n    using ERR_LIB_SYS are now raised as OSError.\n  - gh-121277: Writers of CPythonâs documentation can now use\n    next as the version for the versionchanged, versionadded,\n    deprecated directives.\n  - gh-106883: Disable GC during the _PyThread_CurrentFrames()\n    and _PyThread_CurrentExceptions() calls to avoid the\n    interpreter to deadlock.\n- Remove upstreamed patch:\n  - CVE-2025-0938-sq-brackets-domain-names.patch\n- Add gh-126572-test_ssl-no-stop-ThreadedEchoServer-OSError.patch\n  which makes test_ssl not to stop ThreadedEchoServer on OSError,\n  which makes test_ssl pass with OpenSSL 3.5 (bsc#1241067,\n  gh#python/cpython!126572)\n\n- Allow to disable PGO\n\n- Skip PGO with %want_reproducible_builds (bsc#1239210)\n\n- Add CVE-2025-0938-sq-brackets-domain-names.patch which\n  disallows square brackets ([ and ]) in domain names for parsed\n  URLs (bsc#1236705, CVE-2025-0938, gh#python/cpython#105704)\n\n- Configure externally_managed with a bcond\n  https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Python:Externally_managed\n  bsc#1228165\n\n- Update to 3.11.11:\n  - Tools/Demos\n  - gh-123418: Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.15\n    and multissltests to use 3.0.15, 3.1.7, and 3.2.3.\n  - Tests\n  - gh-125041: Re-enable skipped tests for zlib on the\n    s390x architecture: only skip checks of the compressed\n    bytes, which can be different between zlibâs software\n    implementation and the hardware-accelerated implementation.\n  - Security\n  - gh-126623: Upgrade libexpat to 2.6.4\n  - gh-122792: Changed IPv4-mapped ipaddress.IPv6Address to\n    consistently use the mapped IPv4 address value for deciding\n    properties. Properties which have their behavior fixed are\n    is_multicast, is_reserved, is_link_local, is_global, and\n    is_unspecified.\n  - Library\n  - gh-124651: Properly quote template strings in venv\n    activation scripts (bsc#1232241, CVE-2024-9287).\n- Removed upstreamed patches:\n  - CVE-2024-9287-venv_path_unquoted.patch\n\n- Add add-loongarch64-support.patch to support loongarch64\n\nPackage rpm was updated:\n\n- fix --runposttrans not working correctly with the --root  option [bnc#1216091]\n  * updated patch: posttrans.diff\n  * added \u0026quot;rpm_fixed_runposttrans\u0026quot; provides for libzypp\n- print scriptlet messages in --runposttrans\n  * needed to fix leaking tmp files [bsc#1218459]\n  * updated patch: posttrans.diff\n- fix memory leak in str2locale [bsc#1241052]\n  * updated patch: localetag.diff\n\nPackage libsolv was updated:\n\n- add support for product-obsoletes() provides in the product  autopackage generation code\n- bump version to 0.7.34\n\n- improve transaction ordering by allowing more uninst-\u0026gt;uninst\n  edges [bsc#1243457]\n- implement color filtering when adding update targets\n- support orderwithrequires dependencies in susedata.xml\n- bump version to 0.7.33\n\n- build both static and dynamic libraries on new suse distros\n- support the apk package and repository format (both v2 and v3)\n- new dataiterator_final_{repo,solvable} functions\n- bump version to 0.7.32\n\n- Provide a symbol specific for the ruby-version\n  so yast does not break across updates (boo#1235598)\n\n- fix replaces_installed_package using the wrong solvable id\n  when checking the noupdate map\n- make POOL_FLAG_ADDFILEPROVIDESFILTERED behaviour more standard\n- add rpm_query_idarray query function\n- support rpm's \u0026quot;orderwithrequires\u0026quot; dependency\n- bump version to 0.7.31\n\nPackage sqlite3 was updated:\n\n- Mark build recipe as POSIX-sh-incompatible- Run mkdir/rm with verbose mode for the build log\n\n- Update to release 3.49.1:\n  * Improve portability of makefiles and configure scripts.\n  * CVE-2025-29087, bsc#1241020: Fix a bug in the concat_ws()\n    function, introduced in version 3.44.0, that could lead to a\n    memory error if the separator string is very large (hundreds\n    of megabytes).\n  * CVE-2025-29088, bsc#1241078: Enhanced the\n    SQLITE_DBCONFIG_LOOKASIDE interface to make it  more robust\n    against misuse.\n\n- Update to release 3.49.0:\n  * Enhancements to the query planner:\n  - Improve the query-time index optimization so that it works on\n    WITHOUT ROWID tables.\n  - Better query plans for large star-query joins. This fixes\n    three different performance regressions that were reported\n    on the SQLite Forum.\n  - When two or more queries have the same estimated cost, use\n    the one with the fewer bytes per row.\n  * Enhance the iif() SQL function so that it can accept any number\n    of arguments greater than or equal to two.\n  * Enhance the session extension so that it works on databases\n    that make use of generated columns.\n  * Omit the SQLITE_USE_STDIO_FOR_CONSOLE compile-time option which\n    was not implemented correctly and never worked right. In its place\n    add the SQLITE_USE_W32_FOR_CONSOLE_IO compile-time option. This\n    option applies to command-line tools like the CLI only, not to the\n    SQLite core. It causes Win32 APIs to be used for console I/O\n    instead of stdio. This option affects Windows builds only.\n  * Three new options to sqlite3_db_config(). All default \u0026quot;on\u0026quot;.\n    SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_ATTACH_CREATE\n    SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_ATTACH_WRITE\n    SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_COMMENTS\n\n- Re-enable SONAME which got disabled by default in 3.48.0.\n  * https://www.sqlite.org/src/forumpost/5a3b44f510df8ded\n  * https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/ab8f15697a\n\n- Update to release 3.48.0:\n  * Improved EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output for covering indexes.\n  * Allow a two-argument version of the iif() SQL function.\n  * Also allow if() as an alternative spelling for iif().\n  * Add the \u0026quot;.dbtotxt\u0026quot; command to the CLI.\n  * Add the SQLITE_IOCAP_SUBPAGE_READ property to the\n    xDeviceCharacteristics method of the sqlite3_io_methods object.\n  * Add the SQLITE_PREPARE_DONT_LOG option to sqlite3_prepare_v3()\n    that prevents warning messages being sent to the error log if\n    the SQL is ill-formed. This allows sqlite3_prepare_v3() to be\n    used to do test compiles of SQL to check for validity without\n    polluting the error log with false messages.\n  * Increase the minimum allowed value of SQLITE_LIMIT_LENGTH from\n    1 to 30.\n  * Added the SQLITE_FCNTL_NULL_IO file control.\n  * Extend the FTS5 auxiliary API xInstToken() to work with prefix\n    queries via the insttoken configuration option and the\n    fts5_insttoken() SQL function.\n  * Increase the maximum number of arguments to an SQL function\n    from 127 to 1000.\n  * Obsoletes sqlite3-6216bfcb.patch .\n\n- Add sqlite3-6216bfcb.patch to fix a test suite regression in\n  3.47.0 on s390x. Only the test was broken, not the code itself.\n  https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/7b2bab04c5\n\n- Update to release 3.47.2:\n  * Fix a problem in text-to-floating-point conversion that affects\n    text values where the first 16 significant digits are\n    '1844674407370955'. This issue was introduced in 3.47.0 and\n    only arises on x64 and i386 hardware.\n  * Other minor bug fixes.\n- Enable the session extension, because NodeJS 22 needs it.\n\n- Update to release 3.47.1:\n  * Fix the makefiles so that they once again honored DESTDIR for\n    the \u0026quot;install\u0026quot; target.\n  * Add the SQLITE_IOCAP_SUBPAGE_READ capability to the VFS, to\n    work around issues on some non-standard VFSes caused by making\n    SQLITE_DIRECT_OVERFLOW_READ the default in version 3.45.0.\n  * Fix incorrect answers to certain obscure IN queries caused by\n    new query optimizations added in the 3.47.0 release.\n  * Other minor bug fixes.\n\n- Update to release 3.47.0:\n  * Allow arbitrary expressions in the second argument to the RAISE\n    function.\n  * If the RHS of the -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; operator is negative, then access array\n    elements counting from the right.\n  * Fix a problem with rolling back hot journal files in the\n    seldom-used unix-dotfile VFS.\n  * FTS5 tables can now be dropped even if they use a non-standard\n    tokenizer that has not been registered.\n  * Fix the group_concat() aggregate function so that it returns an\n    empty string, not a NULL, if it receives a single input value\n    which is an empty string.\n  * Enhance the generate_series() table-valued function so that it\n    is able to recognize and use constraints on its output value.\n    Preupdate hooks now recognize when a column added by ALTER\n    TABLE ADD COLUMN has a non-null default value.\n  * Improved reuse of subqueries associated with the IN operator,\n    especially when the IN operator has been duplicated due to\n    predicate push-down.\n  * Use a Bloom filter on subqueries on the right-hand side of the\n    IN operator, in cases where that seems likely to improve\n    performance.\n  * Ensure that queries like \u0026quot;SELECT func(a) FROM tab GROUP BY 1\u0026quot;\n    only invoke the func() function once per row.\n  * No attempt is made to create automatic indexes on a column\n    that is known to be non-selective because of its use in other\n    indexes that have been analyzed.\n  * Adjustments to the query planner so that it produces better\n    plans for star queries with a large number of dimension\n    tables.\n  * Add the \u0026quot;order-by-subquery\u0026quot; optimization, that seeks to\n    disable sort operations in outer queries if the desired order\n    is obtained naturally due to ORDER BY clauses in subqueries.\n  * The \u0026quot;indexed-subtype-expr\u0026quot; optimization strives to use\n    expressions that are part of an index rather than recomputing\n    the expression based on table values, as long as the query\n    planner can prove that the subtype of the expression will\n    never be used.\n  * Miscellaneous coding tweaks for faster runtimes.\n  * Add the experimental sqlite3_rsync program.\n  * Add extension functions median(), percentile(),\n    percentile_cont(), and percentile_disc() to the CLI.\n  * Add the .www dot-command to the CLI.\n  * The sqlite3_analyzer utility now provides a break-out of\n    statistics for WITHOUT ROWID tables.\n  * The sqldiff utility avoids creating an empty database if its\n    second argument does not exist.\n  * Enhance the sqlite_dbpage table-valued function such that\n    INSERT can be used to increase or decrease the size of the\n    database file.\n  * SQLite no longer makes any use of the \u0026quot;long double\u0026quot; data type,\n    as hardware support for long double is becoming less common\n    and long double creates challenges for some compiler tool\n    chains. Instead, SQLite uses Dekker's algorithm when extended\n    precision is needed.\n  * The TCL Interface for SQLite supports TCL9. Everything\n    probably still works for TCL 8.5 and later, though this is not\n    guaranteed. Users are encouraged to upgrade to TCL9.\n  * Fix a corruption-causing bug in the JavaScript \u0026quot;opfs\u0026quot; VFS.\n    Correct \u0026quot;mode=ro\u0026quot; handling for the \u0026quot;opfs\u0026quot; VFS.  Work around a\n    couple of browser-specific OPFS quirks.\n  * Add the fts5_tokenizer_v2 API and the locale=1 option, for\n    creating custom locale-aware tokenizers and fts5 tables that\n    may take advantage of them.\n  * Add the contentless_unindexed=1 option, for creating\n    contentless fts5 tables that store the values of any UNINDEXED\n    columns persistently in the database.\n  * Allow an FTS5 table to be dropped even if it uses a custom\n    tokenizer whose implementation is not available.\n\n- Update to release 3.46.1:\n  * Improved robustness while parsing the tokenize= arguments in\n    FTS5.\n  * Enhancements to covering index prediction in the query planner.\n  * Do not let the number of terms on a VALUES clause be limited by\n    SQLITE_LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT, even if the VALUES clause\n    contains elements that appear to be variables due to\n    double-quoted string literals.\n  * Fix the window function version of group_concat() so that it\n    returns an empty string if it has one or more empty string\n    inputs.\n  * In FTS5 secure-delete mode, fix false-positive integrity-check\n    reports about corrupt indexes.\n  * Syntax errors in ALTER TABLE should always return SQLITE_ERROR.\n    In some cases, they were formerly returning SQLITE_INTERNAL.\n  * Other minor fixes.\n\n- Update to release 3.46.0:\n  * https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_46_0.html\n  * Enhance PRAGMA optimize in multiple ways.\n  * Enhancements to the date and time functions.\n  * Add support for underscore (\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;) characters between digits in\n    numeric literals.\n  * Add the json_pretty() SQL function.\n  * Query planner improvements.\n  * Allocate additional memory from the heap for the SQL parser\n    stack if that stack overflows, rather than reporting a \u0026quot;parser\n    stack overflow\u0026quot; error.\n  * Allow ASCII control characters within JSON5 string literals.\n  * Fix the -\u0026gt; and -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; JSON operators so that when the right-hand\n    side operand is a string that looks like an integer it is still\n    treated as a string, because that is what PostgreSQL does.\n  * Obsoletes sqlite3-float-i586.patch.\n\n- Update to release 3.45.3:\n  * Fix a long-standing bug (going back to version 3.24.0) that\n    might (rarely) cause the \u0026quot;old.*\u0026quot; values of an UPDATE trigger\n    to be incorrect if that trigger fires in response to an UPSERT.\n  * Reduce the scope of the NOT NULL strength reduction\n    optimization that was added as item 8e in version 3.35.0. The\n    optimization was being attempted in some contexts where it did\n    not work, resulting in incorrect query results.\n- Add SQLITE_STRICT_SUBTYPE=1 as recommended by upstream.\n\n- Update to release 3.45.2:\n  * Added the SQLITE_RESULT_SUBTYPE property for application-\n    defined SQL functions.\n  * Enhancements to the JSON SQL functions\n  * Add the FTS5 tokendata option to the FTS5 virtual table.\n  * The SQLITE_DIRECT_OVERFLOW_READ optimization is now enabled by\n    default.\n  * Query planner improvements\n  * Increase the default value for SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_COUNT from\n    1073741824 to 4294967294.\n  * Enhancements to the CLI\n  * Restore the JSON BLOB input bug, and promise to support the\n    anomaly in subsequent releases, for backward compatibility.\n  * Fix the PRAGMA integrity_check command so that it works on\n    read-only databases that contain FTS3 and FTS5 tables.\n  * Fix issues associated with processing corrupt JSONB inputs.\n  * Fix a long-standing bug in which a read of a few bytes past the\n    end of a memory-mapped segment might occur when accessing a\n    craftily corrupted database using memory-mapped database.\n  * Fix a long-standing bug in which a NULL pointer dereference\n    might occur in the bytecode engine due to incorrect bytecode\n    being generated for a class of SQL statements that are\n    deliberately designed to stress the query planner but which\n    are otherwise pointless.\n  * Fix an error in UPSERT, introduced in version 3.35.0.\n  * Reduce the scope of the NOT NULL strength reduction\n    optimization that was added in version 3.35.0.\n- Add sqlite3-float-i586.patch to fix build on i586.\n- sqlite3-rtree-i686.patch is not needed anymore.\n- Abort build when %version and %tarversion don't match.\n\nPackage libssh was updated:\n\n- Fix CVE-2025-5372: ssh_kdf() returns a success code on certain failures (bsc#1245314)  * Add patch libssh-CVE-2025-5372.patch\n- Fix CVE-2025-5987: Invalid return code for chacha20 poly1305 with OpenSSL backend (bsc#1245317)\n  * Add patch libssh-CVE-2025-5987.patch\n- Fix CVE-2025-4877: Write beyond bounds in binary to base64 conversion functions (bsc#1245309)\n  * Add patch libssh-CVE-2025-4877.patch\n- Fix CVE-2025-4878: Use of uninitialized variable in privatekey_from_file() (bsc#1245310)\n  * Add patches:\n  - libssh-CVE-2025-4878-1.patch\n  - libssh-CVE-2025-4878-2.patch\n- Fix CVE-2025-5318: Likely read beyond bounds in sftp server handle management (bsc#1245311)\n  * Add patch libssh-CVE-2025-5318.patch\n- Fix CVE-2025-5351: Double free in functions exporting keys (bsc#1245312)\n  * Add patch libssh-CVE-2025-5351.patch\n\nPackage systemd was updated:\n\n- Remove the script used to help migrating the language and locale settings  located in /etc/sysconfig/language on old systems to the systemd default\n  locations (bsc#1247074)\n  The script was introduced more than 7 years ago and all systems running TW\n  should have been migrated since then. Moreover the installer supports the\n  systemd default locations since approximately SLE15.\n\n- triggers.systemd: skip update of hwdb, journal-catalog if executed during an\n  offline update.\n\n- Import commit 247091bc99ba506cee501b520d1d0a11d772fc13 (merge of v254.27)\n  For a complete list of changes, visit:\n  https://github.com/openSUSE/systemd/compare/aa12f501ae4749c542a091028d848796da4ef51b...247091bc99ba506cee501b520d1d0a11d772fc13\n\n- Import commit aa12f501ae4749c542a091028d848796da4ef51b\n  aa12f501ae logs-show: get timestamp and boot ID only when necessary (bsc#1242827)\n  e8b17d11bc sd-journal: drop to use Hashmap to manage journal files per boot ID\n  ea80273738 tree-wide: set SD_JOURNAL_ASSUME_IMMUTABLE where appropriate\n  a5b3b5344f sd-journal: introduce SD_JOURNAL_ASSUME_IMMUTABLE flag\n  5fa0600b34 sd-journal: make journal_file_read_tail_timestamp() notify to the caller that some new journal entries added\n  737e8193e7 sd-journal: cache last entry offset and journal file state\n  057dca426f sd-journal: fix typo in function name\n\n- Import commit 656494acfaf4b7ac5f3137c09b96b8c4bf08f7d0 (merge of v254.25)\n  This merge includes the following fix:\n    7fc7aa5a4d coredump: use %d in kernel core pattern (bsc#1243935 CVE-2025-4598)\n  For a complete list of changes, visit:\n  https://github.com/openSUSE/systemd/compare/41d2be2fb502e62e671db2b22ee330af8fade7e2...656494acfaf4b7ac5f3137c09b96b8c4bf08f7d0\n\n- Import commit 41d2be2fb502e62e671db2b22ee330af8fade7e2\n  41d2be2fb5 Revert \u0026quot;macro: terminate the temporary VA_ARGS_FOREACH() array with a sentinel\u0026quot; (SUSE specific)\n\n- Import commit 806c21e22ba4e3038817c20da19633b483b3ee80\n  806c21e22b umount: do not move busy network mounts (bsc#1236177)\n\n- Import commit ebdfa3e44e0c85febfa3b35fc8843f8db6f3fb10\n  ebdfa3e44e man/pstore.conf: pstore.conf template is not always installed in /etc\n  304ed20aab man: coredump.conf template is not always installed in /etc (bsc#1237496)\n\n- Add 1003-journal-again-create-user-journals-for-users-with-hi.patch (bsc#1242938)\n  Don't write messages sent from users with UID falling into the container UID\n  range to the system journal. Daemons in the container don't talk to the\n  outside journald as they talk to the inner one directly, which does its\n  journal splitting based on shifted uids.\n\n- Add 1002-udev-persistent-net-rule-generator-support.patch (bsc#1241190)\n  This re-adds back the support for the persistent net name rules as well as\n  their generator since predictable naming scheme is still disabled by default\n  on Micro (via the `net.ifnames=0` boot option).\n\nPackage tpm2.0-abrmd was updated:\n\n- sync with Factory package to fix SELinux issues in SLE Micro 6.1 (bsc#1246460)\n- also enable SELinux features for SLE-16 (bsc#1240070). On SLE-16 abrmd does\n  not work, because the SELinux configuration is missing and thus its\n  operations are denied. Include SLE-16 to fix this.\n\n- Drop rcFOO symlinks for CODE16 (PED-266).\n\n- Fix SELinux sbin/bin merge (bsc#1229047)\n  1229047-fix-bin-sbin-selinux.patch\n  Can be dropped once https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd/pull/846\n  is merged upstream\n\nPackage libxml2 was updated:\n\n- security update- added patches\n  CVE-2024-40896 [bsc#1234812], XXE vulnerability\n  + libxml2-CVE-2024-40896.patch\n\n- security update\n- added patches\n  CVE-2025-32414 [bsc#1241551], out-of-bounds read when parsing text via the Python API\n  + libxml2-CVE-2025-32414.patch\n  CVE-2025-32415 [bsc#1241453], a crafted XML document may lead to a heap-based buffer under-read\n  + libxml2-CVE-2025-32415.patch\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Fix evaluation of libproxy results (bsc#1247690)- Replace URL variables inside mirrorlist/metalink files\n  (fixes #667)\n- version 17.37.16 (35)\n\n- Append RepoInfo::path() to the mirror URLs in Preloader\n  (bsc#1247054)\n- version 17.37.15 (35)\n\n- During installation indicate the backend being used (bsc#1246038)\n  If some package actually needs to know, it should test for\n  ZYPP_CLASSIC_RPMTRANS being set in the environment.\n  Otherwise the transaction is driven by librpm.\n- version 17.37.14 (35)\n\n- Workaround 'rpm -vv' leaving scriptlets /var/tmp (bsc#1218459)\n- Verbose log libproxy results if PX_DEBUG=1 is set.\n- BuildRequires:  cmake \u0026gt;= 3.17.\n- version 17.37.13 (35)\n\n- Allow explicit request to probe an added repo's URL\n  (bsc#1246466)\n- Fix tests with -DISABLE_MEDIABACKEND_TESTS=1 (fixes #661)\n- version 17.37.12 (35)\n\n- Add runtime check for a broken rpm-4.18.0 --runpostrans\n  (bsc#1246149)\n- Add regression test for bsc#1245220 and some other filesize\n  related tests.\n- version 17.37.11 (35)\n\n- BuildRequires: %{libsolv_devel_package} \u0026gt;= 0.7.34 (bsc#1243486)\n  Newer rpm versions no longer allow a ':' in rpm package names or\n  obsoletes. So injecting an\n    Obsoletes: product:oldproductname \u0026lt; oldproductversion\n  into the -release package to indicate a product rename is no longer\n  possible.\n  Since libsolv-0.7.34 you can and should use:\n    Provides: product-obsoletes(oldproductname) \u0026lt; oldproductversion\n  in the -release package. libsolv will then inject the appropriate\n  Obsoletes into the Product.\n- version 17.37.10 (35)\n\n- Ignore DeltaRpm download errors (bsc#1245672)\n  DeltaRpms are in fact optional resources. In case of a failure\n  the full rpm is downloaded.\n- Improve fix for incorrect filesize handling (bsc#1245220)\n- version 17.37.9 (35)\n\n- Do not trigger download data exceeded errors on HTTP non data\n  responses (bsc#1245220)\n  In some cases a HTTP 401 or 407 did trigger a \u0026quot;filesize exceeded\u0026quot;\n  error, because the response payload size was compared against the\n  expected filesize. This patch adds some checks if the response\n  code is in the success range and only then takes expected\n  filesize into account. Otherwise the response content-length is\n  used or a fallback of 2Mb if no content-length is known.\n- version 17.37.8 (35)\n\n- Fix SEGV in MediaDISK handler (bsc#1245452)\n- Explicitly selecting DownloadAsNeeded also selects the\n  classic_rpmtrans backend.\n  DownloadAsNeeded can not be combined with the rpm singletrans\n  installer backend because a rpm transaction requires all package\n  headers to be available the the beginning of the transaction. So\n  explicitly selecting this mode also turns on the classic_rpmtrans\n  backend.\n- Fix evaluation of libproxy results (bsc#1244710)\n- version 17.37.7 (35)\n\n- Enhancements regarding mirror handling during repo refresh.\n  Added  means to disable the use of mirrors when downloading\n  security relevant files. Requires updaing zypper to 1.14.91.\n- Fix autotestcase writer if ZYPP_FULLLOG=1 (bsc#1244042)\n  If ZYPP_FULLLOG=1 a solver testcase to\n  \u0026quot;/var/log/YaST2/autoTestcase\u0026quot; should be written for each solver\n  run. There was no testcase written for the very first solver run.\n  This is now fixed.\n- Pass $1==2 to %posttrans script if it's an update (bsc#1243279)\n- version 17.37.6 (35)\n\n- Fix credential handling in HEAD requests (bsc#1244105)\n- version 17.37.5 (35)\n\n- RepoInfo: use pathNameSetTrailingSlash (fixes #643)\n- Fix wrong userdata parameter type when running zypp with debug\n  verbosity (bsc#1239012)\n- version 17.37.4 (35)\n\n- Do not warn about no mirrors if mirrorlist was switched on\n  automatically. (bsc#1243901)\n- Relax permission of cached packages to 0644 \u0026amp; ~umask\n  (bsc#1243887)\n- version 17.37.3 (35)\n\n- Add a note to service maintained .repo file entries (fixes #638)\n- Support using %{url} variable in a RIS service's repo section.\n- version 17.37.2 (35)\n\n- Use a cookie file to validate mirrorlist cache.\n  This patch extends the mirrorlist code to use a cookie file to\n  validate the contents of the cache against the source URL, making\n  sure that we do not accidentially use a old cache when the\n  mirrorlist url was changed. For example when migrating a system\n  from one release to the next where the same repo alias might just\n  have a different URL.\n- Let Service define and update gpgkey, mirrorlist and metalink.\n- Preserve a mirrorlist file in the raw cache during refresh.\n- version 17.37.1 (35)\n\n- Code16: Enable curl2 backend and parallel package download by\n  default. In Code15 it's optional.\n  Environment variables ZYPP_CURL2=\u0026lt;0|1\u0026gt; and ZYPP_PCK_PRELOAD=\u0026lt;0|1\u0026gt;\n  can be used to turn the features on or off.\n- Make gpgKeyUrl the default source for gpg keys.\n  When refreshing zypp now primarily uses gpgKeyUrl information\n  from the repo files and only falls back to a automatically\n  generated key Url if a gpgKeyUrl was not specified.\n- Introduce mirrors into the Media backends (bsc#1240132)\n- Drop MediaMultiCurl backend.\n- Throttle progress updates when preloading packages (bsc#1239543)\n- Check if request is in valid state in CURL callbacks (fixes\n  openSUSE/zypper#605)\n- spec/CMake: add conditional build\n  '--with[out] classic_rpmtrans_as_default'.\n  classic_rpmtrans is the current builtin default for SUSE,\n  otherwise it's single_rpmtrans.\n  The `enable_preview_single_rpmtrans_as_default_for_zypper` switch\n  was removed from the spec file.  Accordingly the CMake option\n  ENABLE_PREVIEW_SINGLE_RPMTRANS_AS_DEFAULT_FOR_ZYPPER was removed.\n- version 17.37.0 (35)\n\n- fixed build with boost 1.88.\n- XmlReader: Fix detection of bad input streams (fixes #635)\n  libxml2 2.14 potentially reads the complete stream, so it may\n  have the 'eof' bit set. Which is not 'good' but also not 'bad'.\n- rpm: Fix detection of %triggerscript starts (bsc#1222044)\n- RepoindexFileReader: add more \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt; related attributes a\n  service may set.\n  Add optional attributes gpgcheck, repo_gpgcheck, pkg_gpgcheck,\n  keeppackages, gpgkey, mirrorlist, and metalink with the same\n  semantic as in a .repo file.\n- version 17.36.7 (35)\n\n- Drop workaround for broken rpm-4.18 in Code16 (bsc#1237172)\n- BuildRequires:  %{libsolv_devel_package} \u0026gt;= 0.7.32.\n  Code16 moved static libs to libsolv-devel-static.\n- Drop usage of SHA1 hash algorithm because it will become\n  unavailable in FIPS mode (bsc#1240529)\n- Fix zypp.conf dupAllowVendorChange to reflect the correct\n  default (false).\n  The default was true in Code12 (libzypp-16.x) and changed to\n  false with Code15 (libzypp-17.x). Unfortunately this was done by\n  shipping a modified zypp.conf file rather than fixing the code.\n- zypp.conf: Add `lock_timeout` ($ZYPP_LOCK_TIMEOUT) (bsc#1239809)\n- version 17.36.6 (35)\n\n- Fix computation of RepStatus if Repo URLs change.\n- Fix lost double slash when appending to an absolute FTP url\n  (bsc#1238315)\n  Ftp actually differs between absolute and relative URL paths.\n  Absolute path names begin with a double slash encoded as '/%2F'.\n  This must be preserved when manipulating the path.\n- version 17.36.5 (35)\n\n- Add a transaction package preloader (fixes openSUSE/zypper#104)\n  This patch adds a preloader that concurrently downloads files\n  during a transaction commit. It's not yet enabled per default.\n  To enable the preview set ZYPP_CURL2=1 and ZYPP_PCK_PRELOAD=1\n  in the environment.\n- RpmPkgSigCheck_test: Exchange the test package signingkey\n  (fixes #622)\n- Exclude MediaCurl tests if DISABLE_MEDIABACKEND_TESTS (fixes #626)\n- Strip a mediahandler tag from baseUrl querystrings.\n- version 17.36.4 (35)\n\n- Disable zypp.conf:download.use_deltarpm by default (fixes #620)\n  Measurements show that you don't benefit from using deltarpms\n  unless your network connection is very slow.

Square brackets\n    are only valid for IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts according to RFC\n    3986 Section 3.2.2 (bsc#1236705, CVE-2025-0938,\n    gh#python/cpython#105704).\n  - gh-121284: Fix bug in the folding of rfc2047 encoded-words\n    when flattening an email message using a modern email\n    policy. Previously when an encoded-word was too long for\n    a line, it would be decoded, split across lines, and\n    re-encoded. But commas and other special characters in the\n    original text could be left unencoded and unquoted. This\n    could theoretically be used to spoof header lines using a\n    carefully constructed encoded-word if the resulting rendered\n    email was transmitted or re-parsed.\n  - gh-80222: Fix bug in the folding of quoted strings\n    when flattening an email message using a modern email\n    policy. Previously when a quoted string was folded so that\n    it spanned more than one line, the surrounding quotes and\n    internal escapes would be omitted. This could theoretically\n    be used to spoof header lines using a carefully constructed\n    quoted string if the resulting rendered email was transmitted\n    or re-parsed.\n  - gh-119511: Fix a potential denial of service in the imaplib\n    module. When connecting to a malicious server, it could\n    cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. On many\n    systems this is harmless as unused virtual memory is only\n    a mapping, but if this hit a virtual address size limit\n    it could lead to a MemoryError or other process crash. On\n    unusual systems or builds where all allocated memory is\n    touched and backed by actual ram or storage it couldâve\n    consumed resources doing so until similarly crashing.\n  - gh-127257: In ssl, system call failures that OpenSSL reports\n    using ERR_LIB_SYS are now raised as OSError.\n  - gh-121277: Writers of CPythonâs documentation can now use\n    next as the version for the versionchanged, versionadded,\n    deprecated directives.\n  - gh-106883: Disable GC during the _PyThread_CurrentFrames()\n    and _PyThread_CurrentExceptions() calls to avoid the\n    interpreter to deadlock.\n- Remove upstreamed patch:\n  - CVE-2025-0938-sq-brackets-domain-names.patch\n- Add gh-126572-test_ssl-no-stop-ThreadedEchoServer-OSError.patch\n  which makes test_ssl not to stop ThreadedEchoServer on OSError,\n  which makes test_ssl pass with OpenSSL 3.5 (bsc#1241067,\n  gh#python/cpython!126572)\n\n- Allow to disable PGO\n\n- Skip PGO with %want_reproducible_builds (bsc#1239210)\n\n- Add CVE-2025-0938-sq-brackets-domain-names.patch which\n  disallows square brackets ([ and ]) in domain names for parsed\n  URLs (bsc#1236705, CVE-2025-0938, gh#python/cpython#105704)\n\n- Configure externally_managed with a bcond\n  https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Python:Externally_managed\n  bsc#1228165\n\n- Update to 3.11.11:\n  - Tools/Demos\n  - gh-123418: Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.15\n    and multissltests to use 3.0.15, 3.1.7, and 3.2.3.\n  - Tests\n  - gh-125041: Re-enable skipped tests for zlib on the\n    s390x architecture: only skip checks of the compressed\n    bytes, which can be different between zlibâs software\n    implementation and the hardware-accelerated implementation.\n  - Security\n  - gh-126623: Upgrade libexpat to 2.6.4\n  - gh-122792: Changed IPv4-mapped ipaddress.IPv6Address to\n    consistently use the mapped IPv4 address value for deciding\n    properties.

      "Description": "Allows modifying some file metadata (e.g. last modified) with filter=\"data\"  or file permissions (chmod) with filter=\"tar\"  of files outside the extraction directory.\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile  module to extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall()  or TarFile.extract()  using the filter=  parameter with a value of \"data\"  or \"tar\". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter   for more information. Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don't include the extraction filter feature.\n\nNote that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter=  changed from \"no filtering\" to `\"data\", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.\n\nNote that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.",

In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb\n    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.\n\n    The clone skb-\u003e_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the\n    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.\n 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.\n\nThe Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.\n\nThis race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that\ncase later steps perform skb_clone() with skb-\u003e_nfct already confirmed (in\nhash table).  This works fine.\n\nBut such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the\npackets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.\n\nPablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful\nnat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call\nconntrack again.\n\nThis doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat\ntransformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting\nvia 'sabotage_in' hook.\n\nWork around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN\ntime, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.\n\nThe downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.\n\nAlternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with\nunconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this\nopens up other problems, for example:\n\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5\n\nFor multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be\ncreated, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.\n\nUsers should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic\nNOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass\nthem, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,\nso user-visible behaviour would change.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid\n\nThere is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations\nand a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

However, in certain cases,\na raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this\nissue is available in [0].\n\nThus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments\ncan actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never\nNULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such\npointers potentially crashing the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special\ncase the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow\npassing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp\nprograms only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id \u003e 0, as in\nthat case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment.\n\nThe reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will\nrecheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then\nconsider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the\nPTR_MAYBE_NULL flag.\n\nTo allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads\ninto trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL.\n\nWhile trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs\nwhere such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will\ntackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can\nalready be passed into helpers and causes similar problems. Thus, they\nare left alone for now.\n\nIt is possible that these checks also permit passing non-raw_tp args\nthat are trusted PTR_TO_BTF_ID with null marking. In such a case,\nallowing dereference when pointer is NULL expands allowed behavior, so\nwon't regress existing programs, and the case of passing these into\nhelpers is the same as above and will be dealt with later.\n\nAlso update the failure case in tp_btf_nullable selftest to capture the\nnew behavior, as the verifier will no longer cause an error when\ndirectly dereference a raw tracepoint argument marked as __nullable.\n\n  [0]: https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/ZrCZS6nisraEqehw@jlelli-thinkpadt14gen4.remote.csb",

For example, consider the\nfollowing program:\n\n    __attribute__((__noinline__))\n    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)\n    {\n        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);\n    }\n\n    SEC(\"tc\")\n    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)\n    {\n        int *p = (void *)(long)sk-\u003edata;\n        if ((void *)(p + 1) \u003e (void *)(long)sk-\u003edata_end) return TCX_DROP;\n        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);\n        *p = 42;\n        return TCX_PASS;\n    }\n\nAfter a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used\nsafely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list\nof such helpers.\n\nAt the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing\nhelper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when\nprocessing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to\nhelpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in\nthe caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not\nrejected by verifier.\n\nThis commit fixes the omission by computing field\nbpf_subprog_info-\u003echanges_pkt_data for each sub-program before main\nverification pass.\nchanges_pkt_data should be set if:\n- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data\n  returns true;\n- subprogram calls a global function,\n  for which bpf_subprog_info-\u003echanges_pkt_data should be set.\n\nThe verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this\ninformation. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal\ndone by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:\n- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a\n  state when S is fully explored;\n- when S is fully explored:\n  - every direct helper call within S is explored\n    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);\n  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully\n    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).\n\nThe downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not\ntaken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead\nbecause of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume\nthat the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data\ncomputation.",

However, there is an edge case\nwhere an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned\ntransport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.\n\nAnother design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any\ntransport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the\nsockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before\nswitching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a\nfailed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a\nsockmap, which blows up quickly:\n\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000120-0x0000000000000127]\nCPU: 7 UID: 0 PID: 56 Comm: kworker/7:0 Not tainted 6.14.0-rc1+\nWorkqueue: vsock-loopback vsock_loopback_work\nRIP: 0010:vsock_read_skb+0x4b/0x90\nCall Trace:\n sk_psock_verdict_data_ready+0xa4/0x2e0\n virtio_transport_recv_pkt+0x1ca8/0x2acc\n vsock_loopback_work+0x27d/0x3f0\n process_one_work+0x846/0x1420\n worker_thread+0x5b3/0xf80\n kthread+0x35a/0x700\n ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x70\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nFor connectible sockets, instead of relying solely on the state of\nvsk-\u003etransport, tell sockmap to only allow those representing established\nconnections.

Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and\nthe task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory\nfault or access garbage data.\n\nThe issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both\ncfs_rq-\u003eleaf_cfs_rq_list and rq-\u003eleaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same\nleaf list. Also, rq-\u003etmp_alone_branch can be set to rq-\u003eleaf_cfs_rq_list.\n\nThis adds a check `if (prev == \u0026rq-\u003eleaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main\nconditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of\noperation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.\n\nThis check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added\nto the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list\nhead is enough.\n\nFixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct\nlayout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable\nbehavior when the layout changes.",

Then socket_match() can correctly check whether\nthe socket was transparent.\n\nHowever, the IPv6 counterpart (nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6) lacks this\nconntrack lookup, making xt_socket fail to match on the socket when the\npacket was SNATed. Add the same logic to nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6.\n\nIPv6 SNAT is used in Kubernetes clusters for pod-to-world packets, as\npods' addresses are in the fd00::/8 ULA subnet and need to be replaced\nwith the node's external address. Cilium leverages Envoy to enforce L7\npolicies, and Envoy uses transparent sockets. Cilium inserts an iptables\nprerouting rule that matches on `-m socket --transparent` and redirects\nthe packets to localhost, but it fails to match SNATed IPv6 packets due\nto that missing conntrack lookup.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: fix crypto_free_acomp() deadlock in zswap_cpu_comp_dead()\n\nCurrently, zswap_cpu_comp_dead() calls crypto_free_acomp() while holding\nthe per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.  crypto_free_acomp() then holds scomp_lock\n(through crypto_exit_scomp_ops_async()).\n\nOn the other hand, crypto_alloc_acomp_node() holds the scomp_lock (through\ncrypto_scomp_init_tfm()), and then allocates memory.  If the allocation\nresults in reclaim, we may attempt to hold the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.\n\nThe above dependencies can cause an ABBA deadlock.  For example in the\nfollowing scenario:\n\n(1) Task A running on CPU #1:\n    crypto_alloc_acomp_node()\n      Holds scomp_lock\n      Enters reclaim\n      Reads per_cpu_ptr(pool-\u003eacomp_ctx, 1)\n\n(2) Task A is descheduled\n\n(3) CPU #1 goes offline\n    zswap_cpu_comp_dead(CPU #1)\n      Holds per_cpu_ptr(pool-\u003eacomp_ctx, 1))\n      Calls crypto_free_acomp()\n      Waits for scomp_lock\n\n(4) Task A running on CPU #2:\n      Waits for per_cpu_ptr(pool-\u003eacomp_ctx, 1) // Read on CPU #1\n      DEADLOCK\n\nSince there is no requirement to call crypto_free_acomp() with the per-CPU\nacomp_ctx mutex held in zswap_cpu_comp_dead(), move it after the mutex is\nunlocked.  Also move the acomp_request_free() and kfree() calls for\nconsistency and to avoid any potential sublte locking dependencies in the\nfuture.\n\nWith this, only setting acomp_ctx fields to NULL occurs with the mutex\nheld.  This is similar to how zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() only initializes\nacomp_ctx fields with the mutex held, after performing all allocations\nbefore holding the mutex.\n\nOpportunistically, move the NULL check on acomp_ctx so that it takes place\nbefore the mutex dereference.",

This issue can be reproduced if puting a\n'mdelay(10)' after 'mutex_unlock(\u0026trace_types_lock)' in s_start(),\nand executing the following script:\n\n  $ echo function_graph \u003e current_tracer\n  $ cat trace \u003e /dev/null \u0026\n  $ sleep 5  # Ensure the 'cat' reaches the 'mdelay(10)' point\n  $ echo timerlat \u003e current_tracer\n\nThe root cause lies in the two calls to print_graph_function_flags\nwithin print_trace_line during each s_show():\n\n  * One through 'iter-\u003etrace-\u003eprint_line()';\n  * Another through 'event-\u003efuncs-\u003etrace()', which is hidden in\n    print_trace_fmt() before print_trace_line returns.\n\nTracer switching only updates the former, while the latter continues\nto use the print_line function of the old tracer, which in the script\nabove is print_graph_function_flags.\n\nMoreover, when switching from the 'function_graph' tracer to the\n'timerlat' tracer, s_start only calls graph_trace_close of the\n'function_graph' tracer to free 'iter-\u003eprivate', but does not set\nit to NULL. This provides an opportunity for 'event-\u003efuncs-\u003etrace()'\nto use an invalid 'iter-\u003eprivate'.\n\nTo fix this issue, set 'iter-\u003eprivate' to NULL immediately after\nfreeing it in graph_trace_close(), ensuring that an invalid pointer\nis not passed to other tracers. Additionally, clean up the unnecessary\n'iter-\u003eprivate = NULL' during each 'cat trace' when using wakeup and\nirqsoff tracers.\n\n [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231112150030.84609-1-ryncsn@gmail.com/",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudp: Fix memory accounting leak.\n\nMatt Dowling reported a weird UDP memory usage issue.\n\nUnder normal operation, the UDP memory usage reported in /proc/net/sockstat\nremains close to zero.  However, it occasionally spiked to 524,288 pages\nand never dropped.  Moreover, the value doubled when the application was\nterminated.  Finally, it caused intermittent packet drops.\n\nWe can reproduce the issue with the script below [0]:\n\n  1. /proc/net/sockstat reports 0 pages\n\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 0\n\n  2. Run the script till the report reaches 524,288\n\n    # python3 test.py \u0026 sleep 5\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 3 mem 524288  \u003c-- (INT_MAX + 1) \u003e\u003e PAGE_SHIFT\n\n  3. Kill the socket and confirm the number never drops\n\n    # pkill python3 \u0026\u0026 sleep 5\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 524288\n\n  4. (necessary since v6.0) Trigger proto_memory_pcpu_drain()\n\n    # python3 test.py \u0026 sleep 1 \u0026\u0026 pkill python3\n\n  5. The number doubles\n\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 1048577\n\nThe application set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUF, which triggered an integer\noverflow in udp_rmem_release().\n\nWhen a socket is close()d, udp_destruct_common() purges its receive\nqueue and sums up skb-\u003etruesize in the queue.  This total is calculated\nand stored in a local unsigned integer variable.\n\nThe total size is then passed to udp_rmem_release() to adjust memory\naccounting.  However, because the function takes a signed integer\nargument, the total size can wrap around, causing an overflow.\n\nThen, the released amount is calculated as follows:\n\n  1) Add size to sk-\u003esk_forward_alloc.\n  2) Round down sk-\u003esk_forward_alloc to the nearest lower multiple of\n      PAGE_SIZE and assign it to amount.\n  3) Subtract amount from sk-\u003esk_forward_alloc.\n  4) Pass amount \u003e\u003e PAGE_SHIFT to __sk_mem_reduce_allocated().\n\nWhen the issue occurred, the total in udp_destruct_common() was 2147484480\n(INT_MAX + 833), which was cast to -2147482816 in udp_rmem_release().\n\nAt 1) sk-\u003esk_forward_alloc is changed from 3264 to -2147479552, and\n2) sets -2147479552 to amount.  3) reverts the wraparound, so we don't\nsee a warning in inet_sock_destruct().  However, udp_memory_allocated\nends up doubling at 4).\n\nSince commit 3cd3399dd7a8 (\"net: implement per-cpu reserves for\nmemory_allocated\"), memory usage no longer doubles immediately after\na socket is close()d because __sk_mem_reduce_allocated() caches the\namount in udp_memory_per_cpu_fw_alloc.  However, the next time a UDP\nsocket receives a packet, the subtraction takes effect, causing UDP\nmemory usage to double.\n\nThis issue makes further memory allocation fail once the socket's\nsk-\u003esk_rmem_alloc exceeds net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min, resulting in packet\ndrops.\n\nTo prevent this issue, let's use unsigned int for the calculation and\ncall sk_forward_alloc_add() only once for the small delta.\n\nNote that first_packet_length() also potentially has the same problem.\n\n[0]:\nfrom socket import *\n\nSO_RCVBUFFORCE = 33\nINT_MAX = (2 ** 31) - 1\n\ns = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\ns.bind(('', 0))\ns.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUFFORCE, INT_MAX)\n\nc = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\nc.connect(s.getsockname())\n\ndata = b'a' * 100\n\nwhile True:\n    c.send(data)",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs\nfound by Haoran Zhang:\n\n1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:\n\nThis fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is\ncalled more than once and calls after the first call do not find any\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:\n\nvhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);\n...\n\nkfree(vs-\u003evs_tpg);\nvs-\u003evs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found\nmatch=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the\npointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:\n\nkfree(vs-\u003evs_tpg);\nvs-\u003evs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf a scsi request is then sent we do:\n\nvhost_scsi_handle_vq -\u003e vhost_scsi_get_req -\u003e vhost_vq_get_backend\n\nwhich sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.\n\n2. Tpg dir removal hang:\n\nThis patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer\ntpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount\ndropping to -1.\n\nThe problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already\nin the vs-\u003evs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so\ntarget_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their\nrefcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added\nin the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in\nprevious calls which are also in vs-\u003evs_tpg.\n\nLater, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs-\u003evs_tpg which will drop\ntheir refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg\nand will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.\n\n3. Tpg leak:\n\nThis fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be\nun-removable because the target name is overwritten when\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different\ntarget names.\n\nThe bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup\na vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls\nVHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we\nhaven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this\nhappens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite\nthe target name and the vs-\u003evs_tpg array. Later when we do\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's\nname and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the\nvs-\u003evs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing\ntarget_undepend_item on the tpgs.\n\nBecause of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major\nuser, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the\nissues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called\nif it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the\ntpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint\nfirst.",

Since it does not use the\nunused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:\n\nbtrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused\n                                           if list_empty // false\n        list_del_init\n        clear_bit\n                                           else if (test_bit) // true\n                                                list_move_tail\n\nAnd we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs\nstate for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to\nprevent.\n\nThe broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like:\n\n  [1272.943527] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\n  [1272.943967] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 61 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.944731] Modules linked in: btrfs virtio_net xor zstd_compress raid6_pq null_blk [last unloaded: btrfs]\n  [1272.945550] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 61 Comm: kworker/u32:1 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.14.0-rc5+ #108\n  [1272.946368] Tainted: [W]=WARN\n  [1272.946585] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014\n  [1272.947273] Workqueue: btrfs_discard btrfs_discard_workfn [btrfs]\n  [1272.947788] RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.949532] RSP: 0018:ffffbf1200247df0 EFLAGS: 00010282\n  [1272.949901] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa14b00e3f800 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  [1272.950437] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffbf1200247c78 RDI: 00000000ffffdfff\n  [1272.950986] RBP: ffffa14b00dc2860 R08: 00000000ffffdfff R09: ffffffff90526268\n  [1272.951512] R10: ffffffff904762c0 R11: 0000000063666572 R12: ffffa14b00dc28c0\n  [1272.952024] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffa14b00dc2868 R15: 000001285dcd12c0\n  [1272.952850] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffffa14d33c40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  [1272.953458] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  [1272.953931] CR2: 00007f838cbda000 CR3: 000000010104e000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n  [1272.954474] Call Trace:\n  [1272.954655]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n  [1272.954812]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955173]  ? __warn.cold+0x93/0xd7\n  [1272.955487]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955816]  ? report_bug+0xe7/0x120\n  [1272.956103]  ? handle_bug+0x53/0x90\n  [1272.956424]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x13/0x60\n  [1272.956700]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n  [1272.957011]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.957399]  btrfs_discard_cancel_work.cold+0x26/0x2b [btrfs]\n  [1272.957853]  btrfs_put_block_group.cold+0x5d/0x8e [btrfs]\n  [1272.958289]  btrfs_discard_workfn+0x194/0x380 [btrfs]\n  [1272.958729]  process_one_work+0x130/0x290\n  [1272.959026]  worker_thread+0x2ea/0x420\n  [1272.959335]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.959644]  kthread+0xd7/0x1c0\n  [1272.959872]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960172]  ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n  [1272.960474]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960745]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n  [1272.961035]  \u003c/TASK\u003e\n  [1272.961238] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nThough we have seen them in the async discard workfn as well.

This can happen if the send\nbuffer is full, during the period when the sender thread temporarily\nreleases the socket lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf().\n\nThis causes the access to the transport data in\nsctp_outq_select_transport(), when the association outqueue is flushed,\nto result in a use-after-free read.\n\nThis change avoids this scenario by having sctp_transport_free() signal\nthe freeing of the transport, tagging it as \"dead\". In order to do this,\nthe patch restores the \"dead\" bit in struct sctp_transport, which was\nremoved in\ncommit 47faa1e4c50e (\"sctp: remove the dead field of sctp_transport\").\n\nThen, in the scenario where the sender thread has released the socket\nlock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf(), the bit is checked again after\nre-acquiring the socket lock to detect the deletion.

      "Description": "OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva attack, exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign API, and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics\n\nDriver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and\nstandalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir\n\nMounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir\nentry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later\non, when the corrupted directory is removed).\n\next4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.'\nand '..' as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads\nthe '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()\nand then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir\nentry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the\nsame data block.\n\nIf the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the\nsanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data\nblock) and leaves \"struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de\" point exactly past the\nmemory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to\next4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer\nwhich results in out-of-bounds mem access.\n\nFix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir\nentries that reach the end of data block.

The code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding\n   the class to vttree\n4. This breaks HFSC scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes\n   are in vttree\n5. Later, when the class is destroyed, this can lead to a Use-After-Free\n\nThe fix adds a second queue length check after qdisc_peek_len() to verify\nthe queue wasn't emptied.",

A simple curl to a HTTP\nbackend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large\npacket sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)\nwhile others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.\n\nIn fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the\nnode with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire\nfor the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been\n152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes\nwas padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we\nsaw user/payload data from prior processed packets).\n\nWe only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and\nthe backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request\ngot dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even\nthough the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to\nthe MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let\nthe curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the\npadding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).\n\nCommit e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") was too eager\nto also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd-\u003elen to rbi-\u003elen. It really needs\nto stick to rcd-\u003elen which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.\nThe latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and\nit indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp-\u003e{data,data_end}\nparts. For e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") the\nrelevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the\nxdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp-\u003eframe_sz.

The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put()\nnot exit early:\n\n\tif (!sid)\n\t\treturn 0;\n\nAnd the answer seems to be simple: the sid comes from vlan.sid which\nsupposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get().\nBut some chip-\u003einfo-\u003eops-\u003evtu_getnext() implementations do not populate\nvlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case,\nlater in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a garbage sid which is\njust residual stack memory.\n\nTesting for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge\nVLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and\ninstalled by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the\nSTU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI,\nso although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to\nzero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the\ncoincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to\nthe same (correct) behavior.\n\nAnother option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for\nmv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one\nwhich already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means\nthe caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access\nuninitialized memory, which is not nice even if it ignores it later.\n\nSo we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the\nsid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure\nfields which might get temporarily accessed.",

The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming\nthat checking for cl-\u003eqdisc-\u003eq.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted\nthe class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem\nduplicate case).\n\nThis patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code\nwon't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the\nreentrant case.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",

The segment list is then DMA'ed by\nthe FW and the length of the DMA is returned by FW.  The driver then\ncopies this DMA'ed segment list to info-\u003edest_buf.\n\nIn some cases, this DMA length may exceed the info-\u003edest_buf length\nand cause the above BUG condition.  Fix it by capping the copy\nlength to not exceed the length of info-\u003edest_buf.  The extra\nDMA data contains no useful information.\n\nThis code path is shared for the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST and the\nHWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE FW commands.  The buffering is different\nfor these 2 FW commands.  To simplify the logic, we need to move\nthe line to adjust the buffer length for HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE\nup, so that the new check to cap the copy length will work for both\ncommands.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize\n\nWhen running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started\nseeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info-\u003esectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb-\u003estart turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb-\u003estart 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info-\u003esectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb-\u003estart 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info-\u003esectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 \u003e\u003e 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix\nit simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.",

Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in\nrunning the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use\nPEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply\nlooking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host\nuserspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.\n\nRunning the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as\ncrashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't\nwritten MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when\ntrying to record PEBS events.\n\nThe issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before\ncommit 7b100989b4f6 (\"perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default\") (after\nwhich, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).\tThe userspace side\nof perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs()\nmisconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.\n\nArguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events\nsimply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there\nis no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad\nuserspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to\nguest-owned events.\n\nNote, commit 854250329c02 (\"KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily\nin two rare situations\") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling\nKVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only\nKVM.",

Those who call dsa_switch_suspend() and dsa_switch_resume() from\n   their device PM ops: qca8k-8xxx, bcm_sf2, microchip ksz\n2. Those who don't: all others. The above methods should be optional.\n\nFor type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -\u003e phylink_stop(),\nand dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -\u003e phylink_start().\nThese seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because\nthat is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the\nbiggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.\n\nTalking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which\ndo not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),\nI have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is\ntriggered:\n\n\tWARN_ON(phydev-\u003estate != PHY_HALTED \u0026\u0026 phydev-\u003estate != PHY_READY \u0026\u0026\n\t\tphydev-\u003estate != PHY_UP);\n\nbecause the PHY state machine is running.\n\nIt's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -\u003e ... -\u003e\nphylink_start() -\u003e phy_start() having been initiated by the user.\n\nThe previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called\nphy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state\nPHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.\n\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for\nphylink, the phydev-\u003eadjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a\ntechnicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (\"phylib: fix PAL state\nmachine restart on resume\"). That commit was written before phylink\nexisted, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which\ndon't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.\nBut phylink itself has historically not been developed with\nsuspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that\nscenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior\nto the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.\n\nThis issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to\nthe above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC\ndriver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where\nthe issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a\nquick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:\n\n$ grep -Zlr PHYLINK_NETDEV drivers/ | xargs -0 grep -L mac_managed_pm\ndrivers/net/ethernet/atheros/ag71xx.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/sparx5/sparx5_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan966x/lan966x_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa2/dpaa2-mac.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fs_enet/fs_enet-main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa/dpaa_eth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/ucc_geth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/enetc/enetc_pf_common.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/prestera/prestera_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mediatek/mtk_eth_soc.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/altera/altera_tse_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/wangxun/txgbe/txgbe_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/meta/fbnic/fbnic_phylink.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/tehuti/tn40_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot_net.c\n\nMake the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a\nphydev-\u003ephy_link_change() implementation equal to the default\nphy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that\nthe phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and\nwhen phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/\nstarted on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that\nif phydev-\u003ephy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the\nkernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.\n\nThus, for the situation where the PM is not managed b\n---truncated---",

This makes it\nso the client drivers cannot simultaneously post adminq commands.\nHowever, the completions happen in a different context, which means\nmultiple adminq commands can be posted sequentially and all waiting\non completion.\n\nOn the FW side, the backing adminq request queue is only 16 entries\nlong and the retry mechanism and/or overflow/stuck prevention is\nlacking. This can cause the adminq to get stuck, so commands are no\nlonger processed and completions are no longer sent by the FW.\n\nAs an initial fix, prevent more than 16 outstanding adminq commands so\nthere's no way to cause the adminq from getting stuck. This works\nbecause the backing adminq request queue will never have more than 16\npending adminq commands, so it will never overflow. This is done by\nreducing the adminq depth to 16.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: tegra: xusb: Use a bitmask for UTMI pad power state tracking\n\nThe current implementation uses bias_pad_enable as a reference count to\nmanage the shared bias pad for all UTMI PHYs. However, during system\nsuspension with connected USB devices, multiple power-down requests for\nthe UTMI pad result in a mismatch in the reference count, which in turn\nproduces warnings such as:\n\n[  237.762967] WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 1618 at tegra186_utmi_pad_power_down+0x160/0x170\n[  237.763103] Call trace:\n[  237.763104]  tegra186_utmi_pad_power_down+0x160/0x170\n[  237.763107]  tegra186_utmi_phy_power_off+0x10/0x30\n[  237.763110]  phy_power_off+0x48/0x100\n[  237.763113]  tegra_xusb_enter_elpg+0x204/0x500\n[  237.763119]  tegra_xusb_suspend+0x48/0x140\n[  237.763122]  platform_pm_suspend+0x2c/0xb0\n[  237.763125]  dpm_run_callback.isra.0+0x20/0xa0\n[  237.763127]  __device_suspend+0x118/0x330\n[  237.763129]  dpm_suspend+0x10c/0x1f0\n[  237.763130]  dpm_suspend_start+0x88/0xb0\n[  237.763132]  suspend_devices_and_enter+0x120/0x500\n[  237.763135]  pm_suspend+0x1ec/0x270\n\nThe root cause was traced back to the dynamic power-down changes\nintroduced in commit a30951d31b25 (\"xhci: tegra: USB2 pad power controls\"),\nwhere the UTMI pad was being powered down without verifying its current\nstate. This unbalanced behavior led to discrepancies in the reference\ncount.\n\nTo rectify this issue, this patch replaces the single reference counter\nwith a bitmask, renamed to utmi_pad_enabled. Each bit in the mask\ncorresponds to one of the four USB2 PHYs, allowing us to track each pad's\nenablement status individually.\n\nWith this change:\n  - The bias pad is powered on only when the mask is clear.\n  - Each UTMI pad is powered on or down based on its corresponding bit\n    in the mask, preventing redundant operations.\n  - The overall power state of the shared bias pad is maintained\n    correctly during suspend/resume cycles.\n\nThe mutex used to prevent race conditions during UTMI pad enable/disable\noperations has been moved from the tegra186_utmi_bias_pad_power_on/off\nfunctions to the parent functions tegra186_utmi_pad_power_on/down. This\nchange ensures that there are no race conditions when updating the bitmask.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV\n\nRLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU\nregisters in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and\nregister reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex.

If not, it logs\n\"ea_get: invalid extended attribute\" and calls print_hex_dump().\n\nHere, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-\u003exattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds\nINT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:\n\n\tint size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf-\u003exattr));\n\nAlthough clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper\nlimit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads\n\"size\" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).\n\nThe \"size\" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called \"len\" in\nprint_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned\ntype), this is then stored inside a variable called\n\"int remaining\", which is then assigned to \"int linelen\" which\nis then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()\nthe for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is\n18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()\non each iteration:\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i \u003c len; i += rowsize) {\n\t\tlinelen = min(remaining, rowsize);\n\t\tremaining -= rowsize;\n\n\t\thex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,\n\t\t\t\t   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);\n\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nThe expected stopping condition (i \u003c len) is effectively broken\nsince len is corrupted and very large.

      "Description": "A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.\n\nA SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.",
