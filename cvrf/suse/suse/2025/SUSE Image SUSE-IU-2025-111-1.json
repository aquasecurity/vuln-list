This has been fixed.\n  * Using rndc flush inadvertently caused cache cleaning to become\n    less effective. This could ultimately lead to the configured\n    max-cache-size limit being exceeded and has now been fixed.\n  * The logic for cleaning up expired cached DNS records was\n    tweaked to be more aggressive. This change helps with enforcing\n    max-cache-ttl and max-ncache-ttl in a timely manner.\n  * It was possible to trigger a use-after-free assertion when the\n    overmem cache cleaning was initiated. This has been fixed.\n  New Features:\n  * Added RESOLVER.ARPA to the built in empty zones.\n- Security Fixes:\n  * It is possible to craft excessively large numbers of resource\n    record types for a given owner name, which has the effect of\n    slowing down database processing. This has been addressed by\n    adding a configurable limit to the number of records that can\n    be stored per name and type in a cache or zone database. The\n    default is 100, which can be tuned with the new\n    max-types-per-name option. (CVE-2024-1737)\n    [bsc#1228256, bind-9.16-CVE-2024-1737.patch]\n  * Validating DNS messages signed using the SIG(0) protocol (RFC\n    2931) could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a\n    denial-of-service condition. Support for SIG(0) message\n    validation was removed from this version of named.\n    (CVE-2024-1975)\n    [bsc#1228257, bind-9.16-CVE-2024-1975.patch]\n  * When looking up the NS records of parent zones as part of\n    looking up DS records, it was possible for named to trigger an\n    assertion failure if serve-stale was enabled. This has been\n    fixed. (CVE-2024-4076)\n    [bsc#1228258, bind-9.16-CVE-2024-4076.patch]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Update to current 2.43.1 branch [PED-10254, PED-10306]:  * s390 - Add arch15 instructions\n  * various fixes from upstream: PR32153, PR32171, PR32189,\n    PR32196, PR32191, PR32109, PR32372, PR32387\n- Adjusted binutils-2.43-branch.diff.gz.\n- Disable zstd-by-default again (needs adjustments in at least\n  golang,llvm15,llvm17 first)\n- Add binutils-fix-branch.diff.\n- Check non-changing of flex/bison inputs only after applying\n  branch and fix-branch diffs.\n\n- drop ld-relro.diff (relro is the default for some time)\n  and it warns on avr spuriously (bsc#1233520)\n\n- Add loongarch64 as new target\n\n- Enable zstd compression algorithm (instead of zlib)\n  for debug info sections by default.\n\n- Update to current 2.43.1 branch [PED-10474]:\n  * PR32109 - fuzzing problem\n  * PR32083 - LTO vs overridden common symbols\n  * PR32067 - crash with LTO-plugin and --oformat=binary\n  * PR31956 - LTO vs wrapper symbols\n  * riscv - add Zimop and Zcmop extensions\n- Adjusted binutils-2.43-branch.diff.gz.\n\n- Update to version 2.43:\n  * new .base64 pseudo-op, allowing base64 encoded data as strings\n  * Intel APX: add support for CFCMOV, CCMP, CTEST, zero-upper, NF\n    (APX_F now fully supported)\n  * x86 Intel syntax now warns about more mnemonic suffixes\n  * macros and .irp/.irpc/.rept bodies can use \\+ to get at number\n    of times the macro/body was executed\n  * aarch64: support 'armv9.5-a' for -march, add support for LUT\n    and LUT2\n  * s390: base register operand in D(X,B) and D(L,B) can now be\n    omitted (ala 'D(X,)');

In order to re-enable them, just do\n    echo 1 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Add docker-integration-tests-devel subpackage for building and running the\n  upstream Docker integration tests on machines to test that Docker works\n  properly. Users should not install this package.\n- docker-rpmlintrc updated to include allow-list for all of the integration\n  tests package, since it contains a bunch of stuff that wouldn't normally be\n  allowed.\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u0026gt;\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. bsc#1231348\n  bsc#1232999\n\n- Add %{_sysconfdir}/audit/rules.d to filelist.\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic \u0026quot;docker build\u0026quot; has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. bsc#1230331\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  bsc#1230333\n- Make some minor name macro updates to help with the docker-stable package\n  fork.\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615\u0026gt;\n  bsc#1230294\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n  * 0006-bsc1221916-update-to-patched-buildkit-version-to-fix.patch\n  * 0007-bsc1214855-volume-use-AtomicWriteFile-to-save-volume.patch\n  * cli-0001-docs-include-required-tools-in-source-tree.patch\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- Update to version 055+suse.359.geb85610b:  * fix(convertfs): error in conditional expressions (bsc#1228847)\n\nPackage e2fsprogs was updated:\n\n- resize2fs-Check-number-of-group-descriptors-only-if-.patch: resize2fs: Check  number of group descriptors only if meta_bg is disabled (bsc#1230145)\n\nPackage expat was updated:\n\n- security update- added patches\n  fix CVE-2024-50602 [bsc#1232579], DoS via XML_ResumeParser\n  + expat-CVE-2024-50602.patch\n\n- Security fix (bsc#1229932, CVE-2024-45492): detect integer\n  overflow in function nextScaffoldPart\n  * Added expat-CVE-2024-45492.patch\n- Security fix (bsc#1229931, CVE-2024-45491): detect integer\n  overflow in dtdCopy\n  * Added expat-CVE-2024-45491.patch\n- Security fix (bsc#1229930, CVE-2024-45490): reject negative\n  len for XML_ParseBuffer\n  * Added expat-CVE-2024-45490.patch\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2024-52533.patch: fix a single byte buffer overflow  (boo#1233282 CVE-2024-52533 glgo#GNOME/glib#3461).\n\n- Add glib2-gdbusmessage-cache-arg0.patch: cache the arg0 value in\n  a dbus message.

The first colon separates header-name from\n  header-value, so escaping in the header-value is not needed\n  anyway.\n  Escaping in the header-value affects especially the urlresolver\n  plugins. The input URL is passed in a header, but sent back as\n  raw data in the frames body. If the plugin receiver does not\n  correctly unescape the URL we may get back a \u0026quot;https\\c//\u0026quot; which is\n  not usable.\n- Do not ignore return value of std::remove_if in MediaSyncFacade\n  (fixes #579)\n- Fix hang in curl code with no network connection (bsc#1230912)\n- version 17.35.12 (35)\n\n- Deprecate librpmDb::db_const_iterator default ctor (bsc#1230267)\n  It's preferred to explicitly tell the root directory of the\n  system whose database you want to query.\n- version 17.35.11 (35)\n\n- API refactoring.

But it appears it\ndoes.  Suspicious.\n\nHowever, regardless of that, the condition for enabling NUMA faults in\nchange_pte_range() is nonsensical.  It uses \"page_mapcount(page)\" to\ndecide if a COW page should be NUMA-protected or not, and that makes\nabsolutely no sense.\n\nThe number of mappings a page has is irrelevant: not only does GUP get a\nreference to a page as in Oded's case, but the other mappings migth be\npaged out and the only reference to them would be in the page count.\n\nSince we should never try to NUMA-balance a page that we can't move\nanyway due to other references, just fix the code to use 'page_count()'.\nOded confirms that that fixes his issue.\n\nNow, this does imply that something in NUMA balancing ends up changing\npage protections (other than the obvious one of making the page\ninaccessible to get the NUMA faulting information).  Otherwise the COW\nsimplification wouldn't matter - since doing the GUP on the page would\nmake sure it's writable.\n\nThe cause of that permission change would be good to figure out too,\nsince it clearly results in spurious COW events - but fixing the\nnonsensical test that just happened to work before is obviously the\nCorrectThing(tm) to do regardless.",

The client as\n\u003e a result indefinitely retries the request.\n\nThe Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all\nNFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a\nREAD.\n\nInstead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed\nand return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent\nthe client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to\nbe consistent with Solaris NFS servers.\n\nNote that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These\nmust be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit\ntype cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks\nagainst sb-\u003es_maxbytes do not work properly.",

This causes a regression\nin reboot/shutdown scenario because in this case callback\niavf_shutdown() is called and this callback detaches the device,\nmakes it down if it is running and sets its state to __IAVF_REMOVE.\nLater shutdown callback of associated PF driver (e.g. ice_shutdown)\nis called. That callback calls among other things sriov_disable()\nthat calls indirectly iavf_remove() (see stack trace below).\nAs the adapter state is already __IAVF_REMOVE then the mentioned\nloop is end-less and shutdown process hangs.\n\nThe patch fixes this by checking adapter's state at the beginning\nof iavf_remove() and skips the rest of the function if the adapter\nis already in remove state (shutdown is in progress).\n\nReproducer:\n1. Create VF on PF driven by ice or i40e driver\n2. Ensure that the VF is bound to iavf driver\n3.

This cause edid corruption.\n\nFollows are the signature at kernel logs when problem happen,\nEDID has corrupt header\npanel-simple-dp-aux aux-aea0000.edp: Couldn't identify panel via EDID\n\nChanges in v2:\n-- do complete if (ret == IRQ_HANDLED) ay dp-aux_isr()\n-- add more commit text\n\nChanges in v3:\n-- add Stephen suggested\n-- dp_aux_isr() return IRQ_XXX back to caller\n-- dp_ctrl_isr() return IRQ_XXX back to caller\n\nChanges in v4:\n-- split into two patches\n\nChanges in v5:\n-- delete empty line between tags\n\nChanges in v6:\n-- remove extra \"that\" and fixed line more than 75 char at commit text\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/516121/",

Since d7dac083414eb5bb99a6d2ed53dc2c1b405224e5\n(\"net-sysfs: update the queue counts in the unregistration path\"),\nunregister_netdev() indirectly sets real_num_tx_queues to 0.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity\n\nSyzbot found a GPF in reweight_entity. This has been bisected to\ncommit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (\"kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid\nsched_task_group\")\n\nThere  is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)\nwithin a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref  in\nreweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawns\nnumber of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),\nwait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets\ninvoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()\nfor it.\n\nIn the above scenario there is a possibility that\nsetpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread\nin the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for\nwhich the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This will\ntrigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(),  as it will\ntry to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.\n\nBefore the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has been\nset in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),\nbefore the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done in\nthe sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issue\nthe remove the update_load param from the update_load param() function\nand call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have the\nTASK_NEW flag set.",

This results in the VF potentially removing\nits DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.\n\nAdditionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within\nthe ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior\nto the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task\nconcurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in\nsimilar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.\n\nFix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and\nremoval flows using the existing VF cfg_lock. This ensures that we\ncannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a\nvirtchnl message or a reset are occurring.\n\nThis locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit\nc503e63200c6 (\"ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown\"), so we\ncan simply revert it.\n\nNote that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the\noriginal commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race\nconditions.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removed\n\nAfter 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the \"type\" field\nof the event then uses the first type number that is available (not\ncurrently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of the\nbinary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them to\nlogic that can parse the binary blob.\n\nThe issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced and\nis in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it is\ndynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamic\nevent is created that has the same number that new event's logic on\nparsing the binary blob will be used.\n\nTo show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing\n # for i in `seq 65536`; do\n     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' \u003e kprobe_events\n # done\n\nFor every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events will\nremove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) and\nincrease the type number to the next available on until the type number\nreaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After it\nreaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks for\nthe next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that number\nis then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,\nonce the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event in\nthat loop will remain the same.\n\nNow that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reuse\nthe previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.\nAfter the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads the\ndo_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer.\n\n # echo 1 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n # cat /etc/passwd \u003e /dev/null\n # cat trace\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849620: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849838: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849880: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n # echo 0 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n\nNow if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string:\n\n # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' \u003e kprobe_events\n\nAnd now we can the trace:\n\n # cat trace\n        sendmail-1942    [002] .....   530.136320: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930817: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930961: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934278: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934563: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"���������������������������������������\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go. A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent. An attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for requests. Version 0.46.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can be used.

Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent\n\nThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan\nand Christian Rossow.\n\nACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:\n\n   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if\n   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c=\n   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\n   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\n   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\n   duplicate (SEG.ACK \u003c SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK\n   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK \u003e SND.NXT) then send an\n   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that\n   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means\n   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the\n   ACK check more stringent since any ACK \u003c SND.UNA wouldn't be\n   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -\n   MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c= SND.NXT) get through.\n\nThis can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,\nby not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.\n\nThis greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.\n\nI added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,\neven if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.\n\ntp-\u003ebytes_acked was added in linux-4.2\n\nFollowing packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows\nthe issue at hand:\n\n0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3\n+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0\n+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0\n+0 listen(3, 1024) = 0\n\n// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //\n\n// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to\n// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.

The steps for\nthis are the following:\n\n1) Quotas are enabled;\n\n2) Task A calls the quota rescan ioctl and enters btrfs_qgroup_rescan().\n   It calls qgroup_rescan_init() which returns 0 (success) and then joins a\n   transaction and commits it;\n\n3) Task B calls the quota disable ioctl and enters btrfs_quota_disable().\n   It clears the bit BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED from fs_info-\u003eflags and calls\n   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which returns immediately since the\n   rescan worker is not yet running.\n   Then it starts a transaction and locks fs_info-\u003eqgroup_ioctl_lock;\n\n4) Task A queues the rescan worker, by calling btrfs_queue_work();\n\n5) The rescan worker starts, and calls rescan_should_stop() at the start\n   of its while loop, which results in 0 iterations of the loop, since\n   the flag BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED was cleared from fs_info-\u003eflags by\n   task B at step 3);\n\n6) Task B sets fs_info-\u003equota_root to NULL;\n\n7) The rescan worker tries to start a transaction and uses\n   fs_info-\u003equota_root as the root argument for btrfs_start_transaction().\n   This results in a NULL pointer dereference down the call chain of\n   btrfs_start_transaction().

And that in turn fixes the module\nunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference\nuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the\nlast reference to the KVM module.\n\nNote that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off\nthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the\nwork will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting\non the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the\nwork to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very\nsmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a\nnew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the\nremaining work is really just:\n\n        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);\n\n        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);\n\n        mmput(mm);\n\nand mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is\nstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.\n\nAdd a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with \"wakeup all\"\nwork items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a\nworkqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes\n__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).\n\nNote, commit 5f6de5cbebee (\"KVM: Prevent module exit until al\n---truncated---",

However, the\nexecution path for accepting an incoming connection never calls\nnetdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimately\nto kernel crashes.\n\nA typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of the\nfollowing errors:\n\n    refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.\n    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\n\nAnd will then have a trace like:\n\n    Call Trace:\n    \u003cTASK\u003e\n    ? show_regs+0x64/0x70\n    ? __warn+0x83/0x120\n    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100\n    ? report_bug+0x158/0x190\n    ? prb_read_valid+0x20/0x30\n    ? handle_bug+0x3e/0x70\n    ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70\n    ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100\n    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100\n    ax25_release+0x2ad/0x360\n    __sock_release+0x35/0xa0\n    sock_close+0x19/0x20\n    [...]\n\nOn reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets\nstuck in an infinite loop:\n\n    unregister_netdevice: waiting for ax0 to become free.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix overrunning reservations in ringbuf\n\nThe BPF ring buffer internally is implemented as a power-of-2 sized circular\nbuffer, with two logical and ever-increasing counters: consumer_pos is the\nconsumer counter to show which logical position the consumer consumed the\ndata, and producer_pos which is the producer counter denoting the amount of\ndata reserved by all producers.\n\nEach time a record is reserved, the producer that \"owns\" the record will\nsuccessfully advance producer counter. In user space each time a record is\nread, the consumer of the data advanced the consumer counter once it finished\nprocessing. Both counters are stored in separate pages so that from user\nspace, the producer counter is read-only and the consumer counter is read-write.\n\nOne aspect that simplifies and thus speeds up the implementation of both\nproducers and consumers is how the data area is mapped twice contiguously\nback-to-back in the virtual memory, allowing to not take any special measures\nfor samples that have to wrap around at the end of the circular buffer data\narea, because the next page after the last data page would be first data page\nagain, and thus the sample will still appear completely contiguous in virtual\nmemory.\n\nEach record has a struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr { u32 len; u32 pg_off; } header for\nbook-keeping the length and offset, and is inaccessible to the BPF program.\nHelpers like bpf_ringbuf_reserve() return `(void *)hdr + BPF_RINGBUF_HDR_SZ`\nfor the BPF program to use. Bing-Jhong and Muhammad reported that it is however\npossible to make a second allocated memory chunk overlapping with the first\nchunk and as a result, the BPF program is now able to edit first chunk's\nheader.\n\nFor example, consider the creation of a BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF map with size\nof 0x4000. Next, the consumer_pos is modified to 0x3000 /before/ a call to\nbpf_ringbuf_reserve() is made. This will allocate a chunk A, which is in\n[0x0,0x3008], and the BPF program is able to edit [0x8,0x3008]. Now, lets\nallocate a chunk B with size 0x3000. This will succeed because consumer_pos\nwas edited ahead of time to pass the `new_prod_pos - cons_pos \u003e rb-\u003emask`\ncheck. Chunk B will be in range [0x3008,0x6010], and the BPF program is able\nto edit [0x3010,0x6010]. Due to the ring buffer memory layout mentioned\nearlier, the ranges [0x0,0x4000] and [0x4000,0x8000] point to the same data\npages. This means that chunk B at [0x4000,0x4008] is chunk A's header.\nbpf_ringbuf_submit() / bpf_ringbuf_discard() use the header's pg_off to then\nlocate the bpf_ringbuf itself via bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec(). Once chunk\nB modified chunk A's header, then bpf_ringbuf_commit() refers to the wrong\npage and could cause a crash.\n\nFix it by calculating the oldest pending_pos and check whether the range\nfrom the oldest outstanding record to the newest would span beyond the ring\nbuffer size. If that is the case, then reject the request. We've tested with\nthe ring buffer benchmark in BPF selftests (./benchs/run_bench_ringbufs.sh)\nbefore/after the fix and while it seems a bit slower on some benchmarks, it\nis still not significantly enough to matter.",

In cgroup v1, the mount operation will\nallocate cgroup_root, and top_cpuset.css.cgrp will point to the allocated\n\u0026cgroup_root.cgrp. When the umount operation is executed,\ntop_cpuset.css.cgrp will be rebound to \u0026cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp.\n\nThe problem is that when rebinding to cgrp_dfl_root, there are cases\nwhere the cgroup_root allocated by setting up the root for cgroup v1\nis cached. This could lead to a Use-After-Free (UAF) if it is\nsubsequently freed. The descendant cgroups of cgroup v1 can only be\nfreed after the css is released. However, the css of the root will never\nbe released, yet the cgroup_root should be freed when it is unmounted.\nThis means that obtaining a reference to the css of the root does\nnot guarantee that css.cgrp-\u003eroot will not be freed.\n\nFix this problem by using rcu_read_lock in proc_cpuset_show().\nAs cgroup_root is kfree_rcu after commit d23b5c577715\n(\"cgroup: Make operations on the cgroup root_list RCU safe\"),\ncss-\u003ecgroup won't be freed during the critical section.\nTo call cgroup_path_ns_locked, css_set_lock is needed, so it is safe to\nreplace task_get_css with task_css.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=9b1ff7be974a403aa4cd",

Much later in the execve() code path, the file\nmetadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how\nto set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the\npermissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.\n\nFor example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not\nset-id:\n\n---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nto set-id and non-executable:\n\n---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nit is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been\ndisallowed.\n\nWhile this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been\nobserved (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating\nthe setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being\nworld-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid\nbit. For example, \"chmod o-x,u+s target\" makes \"target\" executable only\nby uid \"root\" and gid \"cdrom\", while also becoming setuid-root:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nbecomes:\n\n-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nBut racing the chmod means users without group \"cdrom\" membership can\nget the permission to execute \"target\" just before the chmod, and when\nthe chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the\nsetuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of \"only cdrom\ngroup members can setuid to root\".\n\nRe-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata\nhas changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,\nbut until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a\nfull inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that\nthis is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",

      "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.",

Yes, a failed mmap() will always\neventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit\nlifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the\nerror handling in the wrong order.\n\nIn particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store\nbefore the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have\nstale dangling PTE entries.\n\nTo make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial\npfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",

This can happen during unmount because we don't wait\nfor any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against\nthe cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.\n\nFix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call\nkthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.\n\nThe stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880272a8a18 by task kworker/u8:3/52\n\n  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 52 Comm: kworker/u8:3 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc1-syzkaller #0\n  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\n  Workqueue: btrfs-fixup btrfs_work_helper\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x241/0x360 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n   print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:377 [inline]\n   print_report+0x169/0x550 mm/kasan/report.c:488\n   kasan_report+0x143/0x180 mm/kasan/report.c:601\n   __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n   lock_acquire+0x1ed/0x550 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5825\n   __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n   _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0xd5/0x120 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:162\n   class_raw_spinlock_irqsave_constructor include/linux/spinlock.h:551 [inline]\n   try_to_wake_up+0xb0/0x1480 kernel/sched/core.c:4154\n   btrfs_writepage_fixup_worker+0xc16/0xdf0 fs/btrfs/inode.c:2842\n   btrfs_work_helper+0x390/0xc50 fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:314\n   process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3229 [inline]\n   process_scheduled_works+0xa63/0x1850 kernel/workqueue.c:3310\n   worker_thread+0x870/0xd30 kernel/workqueue.c:3391\n   kthread+0x2f0/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  Allocated by task 2:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   unpoison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:319 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_alloc+0x66/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:345\n   kasan_slab_alloc include/linux/kasan.h:247 [inline]\n   slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:4086 [inline]\n   slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:4135 [inline]\n   kmem_cache_alloc_node_noprof+0x16b/0x320 mm/slub.c:4187\n   alloc_task_struct_node kernel/fork.c:180 [inline]\n   dup_task_struct+0x57/0x8c0 kernel/fork.c:1107\n   copy_process+0x5d1/0x3d50 kernel/fork.c:2206\n   kernel_clone+0x223/0x880 kernel/fork.c:2787\n   kernel_thread+0x1bc/0x240 kernel/fork.c:2849\n   create_kthread kernel/kthread.c:412 [inline]\n   kthreadd+0x60d/0x810 kernel/kthread.c:765\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n\n  Freed by task 61:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x40/0x50 mm/kasan/generic.c:579\n   poison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:247 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x59/0x70 mm/kasan/common.c:264\n   kasan_slab_free include/linux/kasan.h:230 [inline]\n   slab_free_h\n---truncated---",

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------\u003e+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",

      "Description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.",

      "Description": "When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might\noverwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than\notherwise intended.\n\nThis affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the\ninsecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like\n`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain\nof the second host.\n\n(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to\nhave been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for\nthe domains involved to trigger this problem.)\n\nWhen `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this\nbug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the\nparent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.\n\nThe result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get\nconverted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by\nthe origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its\nexpiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the\n(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry\n*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier\nthan otherwise intended.",
