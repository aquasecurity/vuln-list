Upstream release notes:  \u0026lt;https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.23\u0026gt;\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-BUILD-SLE12-revert-btrfs-depend-on-kernel-UAPI-inste.patch\n\n- Update to containerd v1.7.22. Upstream release notes:\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.22\u0026gt;\n- Bump minimum Go version to 1.22.\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-BUILD-SLE12-revert-btrfs-depend-on-kernel-UAPI-inste.patch\n\nPackage cryptsetup was updated:\n\n- luksFormat succeeds despite creating corrupt device [bsc#1234273]  * Add a better warning if luksFormat ends with image without any space for data.\n  * Print warning early if LUKS container is too small for activation.\n  * Add patches:\n  - cryptsetup-Add-a-better-warning-if-luksFormat-no-space-for-data.patch\n  - cryptsetup-Print-warning-early-if-LUKS-container-is-too-small-for-activation.patch\n\nPackage curl was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1234068, CVE-2024-11053]  * curl could leak the password used for the first host to the\n    followed-to host under certain circumstances.\n  * netrc: address several netrc parser flaws\n  * Add curl-CVE-2024-11053.patch\n\nPackage docker was updated:\n\n- Update docker-buildx to v0.19.2. See upstream changelog online at  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.2\u0026gt;.\n  Some notable changelogs from the last update:\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.0\u0026gt;\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.18.0\u0026gt;\n- Update to Go 1.22.\n\n- Add a new toggle file /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable which allows users to\n  disable the SUSEConnect integration with Docker (which creates special mounts\n  in /run/secrets to allow container-suseconnect to authenticate containers\n  with registries on registered hosts). bsc#1231348 bsc#1232999\n  In order to disable these mounts, just do\n    echo 0 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. In order to re-enable them, just do\n    echo 1 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Add docker-integration-tests-devel subpackage for building and running the\n  upstream Docker integration tests on machines to test that Docker works\n  properly. Users should not install this package.\n- docker-rpmlintrc updated to include allow-list for all of the integration\n  tests package, since it contains a bunch of stuff that wouldn't normally be\n  allowed.\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u0026gt;\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. bsc#1231348\n  bsc#1232999\n\n- Add %{_sysconfdir}/audit/rules.d to filelist.\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic \u0026quot;docker build\u0026quot; has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. bsc#1230331\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  bsc#1230333\n- Make some minor name macro updates to help with the docker-stable package\n  fork.\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615\u0026gt;\n  bsc#1230294\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n  * 0006-bsc1221916-update-to-patched-buildkit-version-to-fix.patch\n  * 0007-bsc1214855-volume-use-AtomicWriteFile-to-save-volume.patch\n  * cli-0001-docs-include-required-tools-in-source-tree.patch\n\nPackage python-kiwi was updated:\n\n- Fix boot support for ISO media on ppc64  add CHRP boot support for ppc64 and add xorriso option to avoid\n  file name reduction to MS-DOS compatible 8.3 format\n  Co-authored-by: Steffen Winterfeldt \u0026lt;wfeldt@opensuse.org\u0026gt;\n  Co-authored-by: Michal Suchanek \u0026lt;msuchanek@suse.de\u0026gt;\n\n- Update doc config to match with latest theme\n\n- Set grub-bls default to false for SUSE on SLES15\n  For the time being, SLES15 distributions cannot handle\n  KIWI's default to use BLS with GRUB2.

Thus, there is a conflict between \u0026quot;vim\u0026quot; and\n  \u0026quot;xxd\u0026quot; in these cases.\n  Fixing this by removing the version completely. The 'vim' package\n  should always replace 'xxd', even if people are migrating from an\n  older SLE15 service pack which has the exact same version.\n\n- Fix for bsc#1231373 / CVE-2024-47814.\n- Fix

Bus is only allocated\n\t2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but\n\t   device_register() was called\n\nIn case of device_register() has been called we should call put_device()\nto correctly free the memory allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free()\ncalls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state\n\nTo avoid this behaviour we need to set bus-\u003estate to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED\n_before_ calling device_register(), because put_device() should be\ncalled even in case of device_register() failure.",

Keeping the table structure but\naccounting for the difference in port count (5 in SJA1105 vs 10 in\nSJA1110) does not fully explain the difference. Rather, the SJA1110 also\nhas L2 ingress policers for multicast traffic. If a packet is classified\nas multicast, it will be processed by the policer index 99 + SRCPORT.\n\nThe sja1105_init_l2_policing() function initializes all L2 policers such\nthat they don't interfere with normal packet reception by default. To have\na common code between SJA1105 and SJA1110, the index of the multicast\npolicer for the port is calculated because it's an index that is out of\nbounds for SJA1105 but in bounds for SJA1110, and a bounds check is\nperformed.\n\nThe code fails to do the proper thing when determining what to do with the\nmulticast policer of port 0 on SJA1105 (ds-\u003enum_ports = 5). The \"mcast\"\nindex will be equal to 45, which is also equal to\ntable-\u003eops-\u003emax_entry_count (SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). So it passes\nthrough the check. But at the same time, SJA1105 doesn't have multicast\npolicers. So the code programs the SHARINDX field of an out-of-bounds\nelement in the L2 Policing table of the static config.\n\nThe comparison between index 45 and 45 entries should have determined the\ncode to not access this policer index on SJA1105, since its memory wasn't\neven allocated.\n\nWith enough bad luck, the out-of-bounds write could even overwrite other\nvalid kernel data, but in this case, the issue was detected using KASAN.\n\nKernel log:\n\nsja1105 spi5.0: Probed switch chip: SJA1105Q\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sja1105_setup+0x1cbc/0x2340\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffffff880bd57708 by task kworker/u8:0/8\n...\nWorkqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func\nCall trace:\n...\nsja1105_setup+0x1cbc/0x2340\ndsa_register_switch+0x1284/0x18d0\nsja1105_probe+0x748/0x840\n...\nAllocated by task 8:\n...\nsja1105_setup+0x1bcc/0x2340\ndsa_register_switch+0x1284/0x18d0\nsja1105_probe+0x748/0x840\n...",

The cftype pointer returned from\n__file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped\nthe file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the\ninvarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against\nrenames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.\n\nFix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removed\n\nAfter 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the \"type\" field\nof the event then uses the first type number that is available (not\ncurrently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of the\nbinary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them to\nlogic that can parse the binary blob.\n\nThe issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced and\nis in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it is\ndynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamic\nevent is created that has the same number that new event's logic on\nparsing the binary blob will be used.\n\nTo show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing\n # for i in `seq 65536`; do\n     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' \u003e kprobe_events\n # done\n\nFor every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events will\nremove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) and\nincrease the type number to the next available on until the type number\nreaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After it\nreaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks for\nthe next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that number\nis then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,\nonce the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event in\nthat loop will remain the same.\n\nNow that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reuse\nthe previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.\nAfter the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads the\ndo_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer.\n\n # echo 1 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n # cat /etc/passwd \u003e /dev/null\n # cat trace\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849620: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849838: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849880: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n # echo 0 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n\nNow if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string:\n\n # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' \u003e kprobe_events\n\nAnd now we can the trace:\n\n # cat trace\n        sendmail-1942    [002] .....   530.136320: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930817: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930961: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934278: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934563: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"���������������������������������������\n---truncated---",

A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent\n\nThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan\nand Christian Rossow.\n\nACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:\n\n   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if\n   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c=\n   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\n   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\n   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\n   duplicate (SEG.ACK \u003c SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK\n   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK \u003e SND.NXT) then send an\n   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that\n   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means\n   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: support non-r10 register spill/fill to/from stack in precision tracking\n\nUse instruction (jump) history to record instructions that performed\nregister spill/fill to/from stack, regardless if this was done through\nread-only r10 register, or any other register after copying r10 into it\n*and* potentially adjusting offset.\n\nTo make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into\ninstruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame\nnumber in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction\nhistory. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's\nchecked most frequently during backtracking.\n\nThis change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of\nprecision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known\ndeficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of\nverified states, explored in the subsequent patches.\n\nThere are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files\naccording to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).\n\nFile                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)\n--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------\ntest_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)\n\nNote, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to\nminimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between\nbpf and bpf-next trees.\n\nNotice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of\ninstruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of\nrelying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we\nalready have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we\nadded jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but\nalso we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we\ndon't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is\npresent.\n\nRelying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one\nthat was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.\n\n  [0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20231110002638.4168352-3-andrii@kernel.org/",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: tlb: Fix TLBI RANGE operand\n\nKVM/arm64 relies on TLBI RANGE feature to flush TLBs when the dirty\npages are collected by VMM and the page table entries become write\nprotected during live migration. Unfortunately, the operand passed\nto the TLBI RANGE instruction isn't correctly sorted out due to the\ncommit 117940aa6e5f (\"KVM: arm64: Define kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range()\").\nIt leads to crash on the destination VM after live migration because\nTLBs aren't flushed completely and some of the dirty pages are missed.\n\nFor example, I have a VM where 8GB memory is assigned, starting from\n0x40000000 (1GB). Note that the host has 4KB as the base page size.\nIn the middile of migration, kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() is executed\nto flush TLBs. It passes MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES as the argument to\n__kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() and __flush_s2_tlb_range_op(). SCALE#3\nand NUM#31, corresponding to MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES, isn't supported\nby __TLBI_RANGE_NUM(). In this specific case, -1 has been returned\nfrom __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() for SCALE#3/2/1/0 and rejected by the loop\nin the __flush_tlb_range_op() until the variable @scale underflows\nand becomes -9, 0xffff708000040000 is set as the operand. The operand\nis wrong since it's sorted out by __TLBI_VADDR_RANGE() according to\ninvalid @scale and @num.\n\nFix it by extending __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() to support the combination of\nSCALE#3 and NUM#31. With the changes, [-1 31] instead of [-1 30] can\nbe returned from the macro, meaning the TLBs for 0x200000 pages in the\nabove example can be flushed in one shoot with SCALE#3 and NUM#31. The\nmacro TLBI_RANGE_MASK is dropped since no one uses it any more. The\ncomments are also adjusted accordingly.",

This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle\ntime came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so\nwe move the existing \"cycle == 0\" check outside the \"if \"(!new-\u003ecycle_time)\"\nbranch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.\n\nAdd a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.",

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

Once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free.

Then, this new struct is freed and\nthe pointers start leading to nowhere.\n\nBut generally speaking, the current logic is very fragile. It claims\nto be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact, it\nconsumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this\nfunction, there are two vports allocated with their queues and vectors.\nMoreover, it claims to prevent the driver from running into \"bad state\",\nbut in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport in the\npartially allocated state.\nFinally, if the interface is down when the function is called, it always\nallocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the\ninterface later on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there's\na clear memory leak here.\n\nJust don't allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves\ncrashes and memory leaks.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfix bitmap corruption on close_range() with CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE\n\ncopy_fd_bitmaps(new, old, count) is expected to copy the first\ncount/BITS_PER_LONG bits from old-\u003efull_fds_bits[] and fill\nthe rest with zeroes.  What it does is copying enough words\n(BITS_TO_LONGS(count/BITS_PER_LONG)), then memsets the rest.\nThat works fine, *if* all bits past the cutoff point are\nclear.  Otherwise we are risking garbage from the last word\nwe'd copied.\n\nFor most of the callers that is true - expand_fdtable() has\ncount equal to old-\u003emax_fds, so there's no open descriptors\npast count, let alone fully occupied words in -\u003eopen_fds[],\nwhich is what bits in -\u003efull_fds_bits[] correspond to.\n\nThe other caller (dup_fd()) passes sane_fdtable_size(old_fdt, max_fds),\nwhich is the smallest multiple of BITS_PER_LONG that covers all\nopened descriptors below max_fds.  In the common case (copying on\nfork()) max_fds is ~0U, so all opened descriptors will be below\nit and we are fine, by the same reasons why the call in expand_fdtable()\nis safe.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a case where max_fds is less than that\nand where we might, indeed, end up with junk in -\u003efull_fds_bits[] -\nclose_range(from, to, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) with\n\t* descriptor table being currently shared\n\t* 'to' being above the current capacity of descriptor table\n\t* 'from' being just under some chunk of opened descriptors.\nIn that case we end up with observably wrong behaviour - e.g. spawn\na child with CLONE_FILES, get all descriptors in range 0..127 open,\nthen close_range(64, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) and watch dup(0) ending\nup with descriptor #128, despite #64 being observably not open.\n\nThe minimally invasive fix would be to deal with that in dup_fd().\nIf this proves to add measurable overhead, we can go that way, but\nlet's try to fix copy_fd_bitmaps() first.\n\n* new helper: bitmap_copy_and_expand(to, from, bits_to_copy, size).\n* make copy_fd_bitmaps() take the bitmap size in words, rather than\nbits; it's 'count' argument is always a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG,\nso we are not losing any information, and that way we can use the\nsame helper for all three bitmaps - compiler will see that count\nis a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG for the large ones, so it'll generate\nplain memcpy()+memset().\n\nReproducer added to tools/testing/selftests/core/close_range_test.c",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness\n\nIn sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,\nwhen running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the\nround-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active\nbulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.\n\nThis has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a\nhash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of\nthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,\nand if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host\nstate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the\nhost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is\nassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host\nanymore, are incremented again).\n\nBack when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always\nenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration\nflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but\nthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious\ndecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).\n\nAFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around\nhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in\nitself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this\nis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is\nenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first\nbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this\nmode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the\nqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the\narray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and\nused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,\nwhich is quite impressive in its own right.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on\ndecrement as is used on increment.\n\nThe original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed\nin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply\nbefore that.",

(For the\ndetails, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)\n\nThe HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL\nevent, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the\nsame as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum\nperiod of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.\n\nHSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the\nHyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware\nhas more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message\n'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed\nwith a period \u003c 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum\nperiod of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.\nThe recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.\nBecause it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings\nextra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue\nhas been reported so far.",

This causes page cache operations to\nhang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,\ntruncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when\nan inode is evicted from memory, will hang.\n\nSecond, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. \nAs a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's\nfine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with\nNILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\"\nlist, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,\ncorrupting the block mapping.\n\nFix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()\non failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),\nhaving it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and\ncorrecting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure\nthat the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.",

Previously,\nset_output_gamma was being checked for nullity at line 386, but then it\nwas being dereferenced without any nullity check at line 401. This\ncould potentially lead to a null pointer dereference error if\nset_output_gamma is indeed null.\n\nTo fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before\ndereferencing it.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount\n\nDuring unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:\n\n1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically\n   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);\n\n2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective\n   struct task_struct;\n\n3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all\n   the work queues and then free the work queues.\n\nSyzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing\na delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at\nbtrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread\nwas already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait\nfor any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against\nthe cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.\n\nFix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call\nkthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.\n\nThe stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880272a8a18 by task kworker/u8:3/52\n\n  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 52 Comm: kworker/u8:3 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc1-syzkaller #0\n  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\n  Workqueue: btrfs-fixup btrfs_work_helper\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x241/0x360 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n   print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:377 [inline]\n   print_report+0x169/0x550 mm/kasan/report.c:488\n   kasan_report+0x143/0x180 mm/kasan/report.c:601\n   __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n   lock_acquire+0x1ed/0x550 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5825\n   __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n   _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0xd5/0x120 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:162\n   class_raw_spinlock_irqsave_constructor include/linux/spinlock.h:551 [inline]\n   try_to_wake_up+0xb0/0x1480 kernel/sched/core.c:4154\n   btrfs_writepage_fixup_worker+0xc16/0xdf0 fs/btrfs/inode.c:2842\n   btrfs_work_helper+0x390/0xc50 fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:314\n   process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3229 [inline]\n   process_scheduled_works+0xa63/0x1850 kernel/workqueue.c:3310\n   worker_thread+0x870/0xd30 kernel/workqueue.c:3391\n   kthread+0x2f0/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  Allocated by task 2:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   unpoison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:319 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_alloc+0x66/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:345\n   kasan_slab_alloc include/linux/kasan.h:247 [inline]\n   slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:4086 [inline]\n   slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:4135 [inline]\n   kmem_cache_alloc_node_noprof+0x16b/0x320 mm/slub.c:4187\n   alloc_task_struct_node kernel/fork.c:180 [inline]\n   dup_task_struct+0x57/0x8c0 kernel/fork.c:1107\n   copy_process+0x5d1/0x3d50 kernel/fork.c:2206\n   kernel_clone+0x223/0x880 kernel/fork.c:2787\n   kernel_thread+0x1bc/0x240 kernel/fork.c:2849\n   create_kthread kernel/kthread.c:412 [inline]\n   kthreadd+0x60d/0x810 kernel/kthread.c:765\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n\n  Freed by task 61:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x40/0x50 mm/kasan/generic.c:579\n   poison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:247 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x59/0x70 mm/kasan/common.c:264\n   kasan_slab_free include/linux/kasan.h:230 [inline]\n   slab_free_h\n---truncated---",

However, due to\nrtw89_wow_resume() return failure, it will cause the add interface flow\nto be executed again, resulting in a double add list and causing a kernel\npanic.

If not then static_call_del_module()\ncauses a #GP as it blindly assumes that key::mods points to a valid struct\nstatic_call_mod.\n\nThe problem is that key::mods is not a individual struct member of struct\nstatic_call_key, it's part of a union to save space:\n\n        union {\n                /* bit 0: 0 = mods, 1 = sites */\n                unsigned long type;\n                struct static_call_mod *mods;\n                struct static_call_site *sites;\n\t};\n\nkey::sites is a pointer to the list of built-in usage sites of the static\ncall.

As the sites are\nwalked in the same order as in __static_call_init() the site walk can be\nterminated because all subsequent sites have not been touched by the init\ncode due to the error exit.\n\nIf it was converted before the allocation fail, then the inner loop which\nsearches for a module match will find nothing.\n\nA fail in the second allocation in __static_call_init() is harmless and\ndoes not require special treatment. The first allocation succeeded and\nconverted the key to a module chain. That first entry has mod::mod == NULL\nand mod::next == NULL, so the inner loop of static_call_del_module() will\nneither find a module match nor a module chain.

The leak occurs when multiple\nthreads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to\ninconsistent state and potential memory leaks.\n\nTo fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing\nvf-\u003edefault_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(\u0026vsi-\u003emac_filter_hash_lock),\nensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.\n\nAdditionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(\u0026vsi-\u003emac_filter_hash_lock) in\ni40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.\n2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting\n\tportvlan and/or mac filters).\n3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the\n\tmac_filter_hash.\n\nThis synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents\nthe described leak.",

The tunnel_dst is a metadata type\nof dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata-\u003edst.dev is NULL.\n\nThen in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check\nfor frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the\nVxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call\nip_skb_dst_mtu.\n\nThe ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst\nwith valid dst-\u003edev, thus the crash.\n\nThis case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet\ninstead.\n\nPING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) from 0.0.0.0 h1-eth0: 2000(2028) bytes of data.\n[  176.291791] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000110\n[  176.292101] Mem abort info:\n[  176.292184]   ESR = 0x0000000096000004\n[  176.292322]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  176.292530]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  176.292709]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  176.292862]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n[  176.293013] Data abort info:\n[  176.293104]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  176.293488]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  176.293787]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  176.293995] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000043ef5000\n[  176.294166] [0000000000000110] pgd=0000000000000000,\np4d=0000000000000000\n[  176.294827] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  176.295252] Modules linked in: vxlan ip6_udp_tunnel udp_tunnel veth\nbr_netfilter bridge stp llc ipv6 crct10dif_ce\n[  176.295923] CPU: 0 PID: 188 Comm: ping Not tainted\n6.8.0-rc3-g5b3fbd61b9d1 #2\n[  176.296314] Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n[  176.296535] pstate: 80000005 (Nzcv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS\nBTYPE=--)\n[  176.296808] pc : br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x390/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.297382] lr : br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x2ac/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.297636] sp : ffff800080003630\n[  176.297743] x29: ffff800080003630 x28: 0000000000000008 x27:\nffff6828c49ad9f8\n[  176.298093] x26: ffff6828c49ad000 x25: 0000000000000000 x24:\n00000000000003e8\n[  176.298430] x23: 0000000000000000 x22: ffff6828c4960b40 x21:\nffff6828c3b16d28\n[  176.298652] x20: ffff6828c3167048 x19: ffff6828c3b16d00 x18:\n0000000000000014\n[  176.298926] x17: ffffb0476322f000 x16: ffffb7e164023730 x15:\n0000000095744632\n[  176.299296] x14: ffff6828c3f1c880 x13: 0000000000000002 x12:\nffffb7e137926a70\n[  176.299574] x11: 0000000000000001 x10: ffff6828c3f1c898 x9 :\n0000000000000000\n[  176.300049] x8 : ffff6828c49bf070 x7 : 0008460f18d5f20e x6 :\nf20e0100bebafeca\n[  176.300302] x5 : ffff6828c7f918fe x4 : ffff6828c49bf070 x3 :\n0000000000000000\n[  176.300586] x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : ffff6828c3c7ad00 x0 :\nffff6828c7f918f0\n[  176.300889] Call trace:\n[  176.301123]  br_nf_dev_queue_xmit+0x390/0x4ec [br_netfilter]\n[  176.301411]  br_nf_post_routing+0x2a8/0x3e4 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.301703]  nf_hook_slow+0x48/0x124\n[  176.302060]  br_forward_finish+0xc8/0xe8 [bridge]\n[  176.302371]  br_nf_hook_thresh+0x124/0x134 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.302605]  br_nf_forward_finish+0x118/0x22c [br_netfilter]\n[  176.302824]  br_nf_forward_ip.part.0+0x264/0x290 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.303136]  br_nf_forward+0x2b8/0x4e0 [br_netfilter]\n[  176.303359]  nf_hook_slow+0x48/0x124\n[  176.303\n---truncated---",

If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",

Analyzing the core\ndump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved\non to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously\ndata-\u003etask. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in\ndata-\u003etask to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.\n\nWhat's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the\nwaitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding\nthat it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:\n\nrq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()\n==============================================================\nprepare_to_wait_exclusive()\n                                        data-\u003egot_token = true;\n                                        list_del_init(\u0026curr-\u003eentry);\nif (data.got_token)\n        break;\nfinish_wait(\u0026rqw-\u003ewait, \u0026data.wq);\n  ^- returns immediately because\n     list_empty_careful(\u0026wq_entry-\u003eentry)\n     is true\n... return, go do something else ...\n                                        wake_up_process(data-\u003etask)\n                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^\n\nNormally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.\nBut, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue\nentry has already been removed from the waitqueue.\n\nThe bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry\nAFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter\nand THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.\n\nFix it by swapping the order. We also need to use\nlist_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in\nfinish_wait().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support\n\nThe simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are\nunsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for\nuse with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes\nwas added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely\naccess user memory.\n\nThere are three key problems:\n\n1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and\n   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as\n   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which\n   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.\n   lockup or panic()).\n\n2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when\n   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory\n   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor\n   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a\n   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.\n\n3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,\n   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.\n   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the\n   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the\n   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1\n   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first\n   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.\n\n   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is\n   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no\n   worse than (1).\n\n   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or\n   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but\n   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would\n   require either:\n\n   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the\n     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.\n\n   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such\n     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of\n     the TTBR address range.\n\n   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there\n   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error\n   pointers.\n\nPractically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have\nbeen no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it\nappears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with\nuprobes.\n\nAvoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW\n(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and\nsimulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR\n(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as\narm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can\nconsider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but\nthis will require more significant work.",

This\nis the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k\nPTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is\nset up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make\nsemantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).\n\nMore precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success\n(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly\n\"work\" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),\nbut it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the\ndirect map.\n\nNote that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems\nwhere can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with\nCONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and\nCONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent\nfailure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most\narm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be\naffected.\n\nFrom going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch\nseries, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the\nintended behavior [1] (preferred over having\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in\nSIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between\nv16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201124164930.GK8537@kernel.org/\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210121122723.3446-11-rppt@kernel.org/#t\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201125092208.12544-10-rppt@kernel.org/",

This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque\nranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.\n\nAt the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use\nAARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.\n\nTested with the following:\n\n| #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n| #include \u003cstdbool.h\u003e\n|\n| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))\n|\n| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)\n| {\n|         void *addr;\n|\n|         asm volatile(\n|         \"       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\\n\"\n|         \"       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\\n\"\n|         : \"=r\" (addr));\n| }\n|\n|\n| int main(int argc, char *argv)\n| {\n|         void *ptr = adrp_self();\n|         bool equal = (ptr == adrp_self);\n|\n|         printf(\"adrp_self   =\u003e %p\\n\"\n|                \"adrp_self() =\u003e %p\\n\"\n|                \"%s\\n\",\n|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? \"EQUAL\" : \"NOT EQUAL\");\n|\n|         return 0;\n| }\n\n.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:\n\n| 00000000004007e0 \u003cadrp_self\u003e:\n|   4007e0:       90000000        adrp    x0, 400000 \u003c__ehdr_start\u003e\n|   4007e4:       911f8000        add     x0, x0, #0x7e0\n|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret\n\nBefore this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be\nsteppable, resulting in corruption of the result:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' \u003e /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 \u003e /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() =\u003e 0xffffffffff7e0\n| NOT EQUAL\n\nAfter this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| #\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' \u003e /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 \u003e /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() =\u003e 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlegacy: Clear stale interrupts before resuming device\n\niwl4965 fails upon resume from hibernation on my laptop. The reason\nseems to be a stale interrupt which isn't being cleared out before\ninterrupts are enabled. We end up with a race beween the resume\ntrying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form\nthe interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually\nthe whole thing blows up.\n\nFix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before\ninterrupts get enabled during resume.\n\nHere's a debug log of the indicent:\n[   12.042589] ieee80211 phy0: il_isr ISR inta 0x00000080, enabled 0xaa00008b, fh 0x00000000\n[   12.042625] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_irq_tasklet inta 0x00000080, enabled 0x00000000, fh 0x00000000\n[   12.042651] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: RF_KILL bit toggled to enable radio.\n[   12.042653] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: On demand firmware reload\n[   12.042690] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_irq_tasklet End inta 0x00000000, enabled 0xaa00008b, fh 0x00000000, flags 0x00000282\n[   12.052207] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_mac_start enter\n[   12.052212] ieee80211 phy0: il_prep_station Add STA to driver ID 31: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n[   12.052244] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_set_hw_ready hardware  ready\n[   12.052324] ieee80211 phy0: il_apm_init Init card's basic functions\n[   12.052348] ieee80211 phy0: il_apm_init L1 Enabled; Disabling L0S\n[   12.055727] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_load_bsm Begin load bsm\n[   12.056140] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_verify_bsm Begin verify bsm\n[   12.058642] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_verify_bsm BSM bootstrap uCode image OK\n[   12.058721] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_load_bsm BSM write complete, poll 1 iterations\n[   12.058734] ieee80211 phy0: __il4965_up iwl4965 is coming up\n[   12.058737] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_mac_start Start UP work done.\n[   12.058757] ieee80211 phy0: __il4965_down iwl4965 is going down\n[   12.058761] ieee80211 phy0: il_scan_cancel_timeout Scan cancel timeout\n[   12.058762] ieee80211 phy0: il_do_scan_abort Not performing scan to abort\n[   12.058765] ieee80211 phy0: il_clear_ucode_stations Clearing ucode stations in driver\n[   12.058767] ieee80211 phy0: il_clear_ucode_stations No active stations found to be cleared\n[   12.058819] ieee80211 phy0: _il_apm_stop Stop card, put in low power state\n[   12.058827] ieee80211 phy0: _il_apm_stop_master stop master\n[   12.058864] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_clear_free_frames 0 frames on pre-allocated heap on clear.\n[   12.058869] ieee80211 phy0: Hardware restart was requested\n[   16.132299] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: START_ALIVE timeout after 4000ms.\n[   16.132303] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   16.132304] Hardware became unavailable upon resume.

However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if\noverride_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  \n\nFor example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV\nsignal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the\nsignal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. \nThis prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and\nhandling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are\nunaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is\neffectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and\ncrashes, as we observed with java applications.\n\nFix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip\nthe comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively\nrestores the old behavior.",

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------\u003e+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking\n\nRecent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues:\nunder load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions,\n\"Bad page state\"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually\ndon't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent\nchanges being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,\nimproved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.\n\nBefore fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),\nwhich does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),\nwhich is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm\ninternals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to\ncheck usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,\nwhich can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing\ncallers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).\n\nJust omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all\nof whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()\nwill tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no\nlonger has any callers (and will be deleted separately).\n\nSwapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio-\u003ememcg_data 0\nwithout checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;\nwhich is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg\n(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,\nwhen freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially\ncorrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0\nhere, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before\nresetting memcg_data.\n\nThat goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (\"mm: thp: make deferred split\nshrinker memcg aware\"): which included a check on swapcache before adding\nto deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to\nswapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim\n(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue\ncould have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (\"mm: split\nunderused THPs\") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes\nswapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.\n\nKeep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is\nno longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely\nto be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the\nqueue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.\n\nMemcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing\nfolio-\u003ememcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the\ndeferred list, sometimes corrupting \"from\" memcg's list, like swapout. \nRefcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be\nused in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:\nmem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting\nof course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving\ncharge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:\nnobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.\n\nThe 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list\nto another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);\nbut that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (\"mm: thp: don't need care\ndeferred split queue in memcg charge move path\"), which argued that the\nexistence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred\nlist.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.\n\nBackport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take\ncare that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There\nis not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.",

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

In the current\nimplementation, the block_device structure is set after the function\nreturns to the caller.\n\nHere, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer\nhead as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the\ncaller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it\nwas reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call\ntouch_buffer() here in the first place.\n\nSo this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.",

This caused\na double free issue.\n\nTo resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to\nsimplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant\n`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuring\nit is correctly managed by  `usb_fill_int_urb()` and freed by\n`usb_free_urb()` as intended.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/pci: Properly hide first-in-list PCIe extended capability\n\nThere are cases where a PCIe extended capability should be hidden from\nthe user. For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and\nto an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.\n\nFix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater\nthan PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct\nread only access instead of the ecap_perms array.\n\nNote that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can\nexceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which\nare already checked before).\n\n[1]\n\nWARNING: CPU: 118 PID: 5329 at drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1900 vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\nCPU: 118 UID: 0 PID: 5329 Comm: simx-qemu-syste Not tainted 6.12.0+ #1\n(snip)\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n ? __warn+0x8d/0x140\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x244/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_rw+0x101/0x1b0 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_core_read+0x1d/0x30 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_device_fops_read+0x27/0x40 [vfio]\n vfs_read+0xbd/0x340\n ? vfio_device_fops_unl_ioctl+0xbb/0x740 [vfio]\n ? __rseq_handle_notify_resume+0xa4/0x4b0\n __x64_sys_pread64+0x96/0xc0\n x64_sys_call+0x1c3d/0x20d0\n do_syscall_64+0x4d/0x120\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.",

One of these cases is a loop device by\nusing ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWhile this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of\nhfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write\nout-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the\nlatter function reads a different io_size.\n\nUsing a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the\npurposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between\nHFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size.

This may cause a\nsituation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been\ndetected yet, leading to an indefinite wait.

When cookie1\nenters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting\nprocess. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the\n-wait- process indefinitely.\n\nIn commit 3288666c7256 (\"fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in\nfscache_create_volume_work()\"), barriers were added to similar operations\nin fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.\n\nBy combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to\nfix this issue.",
