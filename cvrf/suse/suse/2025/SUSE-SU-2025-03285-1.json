      "Text": "This update for mybatis, ognl fixes the following issues:\n\nVersion update to 3.5.7:\n\n  * Bug fixes:\n\n    + Improved performance under JDK 8. #2223\n\nVersion update to 3.5.8:\n\n  * List of changes:\n\n    + Avoid NullPointerException when mapping an empty string to\n      java.lang.Character. #2368\n    + Fixed an incorrect argument when initializing static object.\n      This resolves a compatibility issue with quarkus-mybatis.\n      #2284\n    + Performance improvements. #2297 #2335 #2340\n\nVersion update to 3.5.9:\n\n  * List of changes:\n\n    + Add nullable to \u003cforeach /\u003e.

To enable this feature globally, set\n      nullableOnForEach=true in the config. #1883\n\nVersion update to 3.5.10:\n\n  * Bug fixes:\n\n    + Unexpected illegal reflective access warning (or\n      InaccessibleObjectException on Java 16+) when calling method\n      in OGNL expression. #2392\n    + IllegalAccessException when auto-mapping Records (JEP-359)\n      #2195\n    + 'interrupted' status is not set when\n       PooledConnection#getConnection() is interrupted. #2503\n\n  * Enhancements:\n\n    + A new option argNameBasedConstructorAutoMapping is added. If\n      enabled, constructor argument names are used to look up\n      columns when auto-mapping. #2192\n    + Added a new property skipSetAutoCommitOnClose to\n      JdbcTransactionFactory. Skipping setAutoCommit() call could\n      improve performance with some drivers. #2426\n    + \u003cidArg /\u003e can now be listed after \u003carg /\u003e in \u003cconstructor /\u003e.\n      #2541\n\nVersion update to 3.5.11:\n\n  * Bug fixes:\n\n    + OGNL could throw IllegalArgumentException when invoking\n      inherited method. #2609\n    + returnInstanceForEmptyRow is not applied to constructor\n      auto-mapping. #2665\n\nVersion update to 3.5.12\n\n  * User impactful changes\n\n    + #2703 Referencing collection parameter by name fails fixing\n      #2693\n    + #2709 Fix a race condition caused by other threads calling\n      mapper methods while mapped tables are being constructed\n    + #2727 Enable ability to provide custom configuration to\n      XMLConfigBuilder\n    + #2731 Adding mapper could fail under JPMS\n    + #2741 Add 'affectedData' attribute to @select,\n      @SelectProvider, and \u003cselect /\u003e\n    + #2767 Resolve resultType by namespace and id when not\n      provided resultType and resultMap\n    + #2804 Search readable property when resolving constructor arg\n      type by name\n    + Minor correction: 'boolean' can never be null (primative)\n    + General library updates\n    + Uses parameters option for compiler now (needed by spring boot\n      3) (for reflection needs)\n\n  * Code cleanup\n\n    + #2816 Use open rewrite to partially cleanup java code\n    + #2817 Add private constructors per open rewrite\n    + #2819 Add final where appropriate per open rewrite\n    + #2825 Cleanup if statement breaks / return logic\n    + #2826 Eclipse based cleanup\n\n  * Build\n\n    + #2820 Remove test ci group profile in favor of more direct\n      usage on GH-Actions and update deprecated surefire along in\n      overview in README.md\n    + Adjustments to build so shaded ognl and javassist no longer\n      throw warnings\n    + Build with jdk 21-ea as well now\n    + Various test cleanup, updates, and additions\n    + Turn on auto formatting of all java code including note to\n      contributors on readme to skip formatting when necessary in\n      code blocks\n    + Tests may use jdk 11 now while retaining jdk 8 runtime\n    + Pom cleanup / better clarification on parameters\n\n  * Documentation\n\n    + Various documentation updates\n\nVersion update to 3.5.13:\n\n  * Bug fix:\n\n    + Unable to resolve result type when the target property has\n      a getter with different return type #2834\n\nVersion update to 3.5.14:\n\n  * Bug fixes:\n\n    + Registered type handler is not used for anonymous enums #2956\n    + Discriminator does not work in constructor mapping #2913\n\nVersion update to 3.5.15:\n\n  * Changes\n\n    + XNode#toString() should output all child nodes.

      "Description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Neutralization of Expression/Command Delimiters vulnerability in Apache Commons OGNL.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.\n\n\n\nWhen using the API Ognl.getValue, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the provided expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and invoking related methods,\n etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive. \nAttackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
