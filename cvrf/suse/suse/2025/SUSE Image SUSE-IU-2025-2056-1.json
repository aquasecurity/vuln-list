There is no obvious place to put the\n  patch removals (the 28.1.1-ce update removing the patches chronologically\n  predates their renaming in SLES), so they are included here a dummy changelog\n  entry to work around the issue.\n  - 0007-CVE-2025-22868-vendor-jws-split-token-into-fixed-num.patch\n  - 0008-CVE-2025-22869-vendor-ssh-limit-the-size-of-the-inte.patch\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.25.0.

PED-12534\n  When this patchset was first added in 2013 (and rewritten over the years),\n  there was no upstream way to easily provide SLE customers with a way to build\n  container images based on SLE using the host subscription. However, with\n  docker-buildx you can now define secrets for builds (this is not entirely\n  transparent, but we can easily document this new requirement for SLE-16).\n  Users should use\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n  when doing their builds.\n- Now that the only blocker for docker-buildx support was removed for SLE-16,\n  enable docker-buildx for SLE-16 as well. PED-8905\n\nPackage firewalld was updated:\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2025-6052.patch: fix overflow check when expanding  a GString (bsc#1244596 CVE-2025-6052).\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2025-4373.patch: carefully handle gssize parameters\n  (bsc#1242844 CVE-2025-4373 glgo#GNOME/glib#3677).\n\nPackage google-cloud-sap-agent was updated:\n\n- Update to version 3.8 (bsc#1244324, bsc#1244295)  * Remove parsing of Pacemaker attribute is_ccm\n  * Update spec file to remove GCBDR packages\n  * Internal cleanup\n  * Send agent status to WLM DW with WriteInsight()\n  * Adds upcoming maintenance events chart and table to the maintenance system events dashboard\n  * Fix Backint log_to_cloud configuration parameter\n  * Update list of process metrics and hanamonitoring\n  * Added Usage metrics to support bundle tool.\n  * Enhance Support bundle collection\n  * Updates to the maintenance dashboard with instructions on setup in the README.md\n  * Update metric override file with new metrics marked for v3.8.\n  * Dashboard updates\n  * Add unit tests for gcealpha.go\n  * Add unit tests for restore.go, remove unreachable code\n  * Add unit tests for versionhandler\n  * Outputting the agent status as a JSON string so it can be queried and parsed Log Analytics\n  * Add usagemetrics for remaining OTEs\n  * Increase coverage to \u0026gt; 90% in processmetrics/networkstats test\n  * Increase coverage to \u0026gt; 90% in processmetrics/hanavolume test\n  * Add unit tests for hanabackup\n  * Added Test Case for GCE Service Creation Failure in Remote Validation Onetime Execution.\n  * Internal change\n  * Update below parameters in google-x4.conf file\n  * Add Hana Monitoring metrics:\n  * Add Hana log disk utilisation metric (in Kb)\n  * Add Linux os metrics as part of process metrics\n  * Make the bare metal metric resource type non-generic\n  * Update TODO\n  * Check the status of the WLM Data Warehouse API before starting metric collection.\n  * Fix data race in status test\n  * Make the bare metal metric resource type non-generic\n  * Add WLM metric collection for SELinux config settings.\n  * Adding the kernel version to the SAP System discovery data.\n  * Collect SAP events in support bundle.\n  * Adding support to collect hana monitoring metrics.\n  * Auto updated compiled protocol buffers\n  * Add Pacemaker WLM metrics: ASCS_IP, ERS_IP, ASCS_VIRTUAL_IP, ERS_VIRTUAL_IP\n  * Add WLM metric collection for kernel version.\n  * Fix github build failures.\n  * Update Go version in build to 1.24.2.\n  * Collect Status in daemon mode\n  * Status OTE agent changes to use artifact registry list version\n  * Add support for /var/log/messages collection including rolled over messages\n  * Added timezone handling logic for querying process metrics\n  * Add WLM metric: CLUSTER_HEALTHY for pacemaker\n  * Collection definition test improvements.\n  * Added support to collect pacemaker log files\n  * Default Pacemaker PCMK fields to empty string.\n  * Use correct destination folder in collectProcessMetrics\n  * Ignore timestamps in test\n  * Update process metrics query to use timestamp, before and after duration.\n  * Add functionality to collect process metrics\n  * Update SAP guest actions to utilize shared library\n  * Update SAP Agent logusage command help message\n  * Changes to the github action if commit/push of generated protos fails\n  * Fix a couple of comments.\n  * Adding support for collecting SapDiscovery logs from cloud logging.\n  * Cleanup agentmetrics_test.go\n  * Proto change\n- Adjust upstream source paths in spec file\n- Bump Go ABI version to 1.24 in BuildRequires\n\n- Add -buildmode=pie to go build command line (bsc#1239946)\n\nPackage google-guest-configs was updated:\n\n- Check that %{_sysconfdir}/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0 actually  exists before making any modifications to it (bsc#1241112)\n\nPackage google-guest-oslogin was updated:\n\nPackage google-osconfig-agent was updated:\n\n- Update to version 20250416.02 (bsc#1244304, bsc#1244503)  * defaultSleeper: tolerate 10% difference to reduce test flakiness (#810)\n  * Add output of some packagemanagers to the testdata (#808)\n- from version 20250416.01\n  * Refactor OS Info package (#809)\n- from version 20250416.00\n  * Report RPM inventory as YUM instead of empty SoftwarePackage\n    when neither Zypper nor YUM are installed.

      "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.",
