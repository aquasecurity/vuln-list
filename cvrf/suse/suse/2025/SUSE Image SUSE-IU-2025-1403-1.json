Image builds that\n  references the former variable name would be broken by the change.\n  This commit makes sure no regression is introduced by providing\n  both variants. This Fixes bsc#1237772\n\n- Fix grub mkimage call for the ppc platform\n  The list of modules used to create a grub platform image for\n  ppc was the same list as used for the x86 bios platform.\n  This commit fixes this and also cleans up the inconsistency\n  and misleading names used for creating platform specific\n  output. This Fixes #2738\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.10 â 10.2.11\n\n- Update box plugin documentation\n  Add chapter about new container build feature. The\n  box plugin can now also run the build in containers\n\n- The ubuntu 20.04 github runner is closing down\n  Make sure to move to another runner for workloads which\n  still uses ubuntu 20.04\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.9 â 10.2.10\n\n- Poetry build sdist timestamps set to epoch 0\n  Newer versions of poetry set the timestamp for all source\n  files to epoch 0. Such sources are not accepted by e.g\n  Debian FTP servers and in general I don't like when tools\n  changes their behavior just like that. This commit forces\n  an older version of poetry for the purpose of creating the\n  sdist tarball which then gets published on pypi. The\n  argumentation for reproducible builds by forcing source\n  files to a certain timestamp doesn't fly for me. I'm open\n  for any better solution though. This Fixes #2730\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.8 â 10.2.9\n\n- Classify missing chkstat as debug message\n  chkstat is a distribution specific tool. If it is\n  present we use it, if not we don't but it's not worth\n  a warning. This Fixes #2711\n\n- Allow to run setfiles multi threaded\n  Use option -T0 for newer setfiles version.\n  This Fixes #2719\n\n- Add rd.kiwi.dialog.timeout option\n  Allow to configure the timeout value for dialogs displayed\n  by the kiwi dracut code. By default the timeout is set to\n  60 seconds. With the special value \u0026quot;off\u0026quot; the dialog will\n  never timeout. This Fixes #2718\n\n- Make sure copy actions does not drop context\n  Use shutil.copy2 to copy files preserving their\n  attributes in the grub BootLoader space.\n  This Fixes #2709\n\n- Improve unit test for archive target_dir\n  Add a test case with absolute path in the target_dir\n  to make sure we never unpack the archive to the host\n  system. The actual issue was resolved together with\n  the implementation in #1953 and commit\n  78238a993c966d1229cd2fc1f5923673a90de14d\n  This Fixes #2701\n\n- Fixed profiled overlay imports\n  When building an image for profile: SOME and providing\n  an overlay directory named SOME/... kiwi will sync the\n  contents of this overlay directory to the root tree.\n  However it took the toplevel name SOME/ into account\n  which is unwanted because only the sub data structure\n  should be synced into the new root tree. This\n  Fixes #2690\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.7 â 10.2.8\n\n- Use multipath child instead of parent device\n  On multipath systems we need to find underlying child device\n  instead of using parent device.\n  This prevents listing all parent devices for a multipath device\n\n- Increase size for agama integration test build\n  Agama needs more space to build now\n\n- Fixed agama integration test\n  rubygem-byebug and rubygem-agama-yast seems to\n  no longer exist\n\n- Update TW integration tests\n  Package nscd was dropped from TW\n\n- Fix documentation regarding URI styles\n  In reference to commit 760a65558f9e2e91d3eaa3a2f9503ff596984b48\n  the support for iso:// URI types was dropped some time ago.\n  However, the documentation was not properly updated. This\n  commit fixes it\n\n- Fix return value of grub helper methods\n  The grub helper methods to find grub tools returns a\n  None value if the tool cannot be found. This None value\n  could be used later in a Command call where it will be\n  used in a join() command to log the resulting commandline.\n  This join() call then fails and raises an unhandled error\n  causing a stack trace in the application. This commit\n  fixes it\n\n- Added disk validation for duplicate installs\n  Installing the same image to different storage disks on the\n  same machine creates device conflicts with unexpected side\n  effects. This commit adds a validation based on the PTUUID\n  of the disk image to check if another device on the system\n  has the same ID and if yes, does not allow to install the\n  image again including a message which device takes the same\n  identifier. This references bsc#1228741\n\n- Fixed documentation for signing key attribute\n  The source locator name for local files was incorrect\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.6 â 10.2.7\n\n- Update documentation\n  Added a new troubleshooting chapter as subsection to\n  the Build Host Constraints named Package Manager Behavior.\n  It serves the purpose to describe options for the customer\n  to change the default package manager behavior which\n  we from the kiwi side do not influence intentionally.\n  This is a followup change to bsc#1235448\n\n- Drop still present tox artifacts\n  There were still some left over tox files and the\n  documentation contribution chapter was also wrong at\n  several places\n\n- Add support for reading optional pkgmgr env file\n  If there is a file .kiwi.package_manager.env in the root of\n  the image tree it will be read and put into the caller environment for\n  the selected package and repository manager. There are features\n  in e.g zypper which can only be used via env variables.\n  This Fixes bsc#1235448\n\n- Auto convert unit test XML data to schema v8.3\n\n- Rename btrfs_root_is_snapshot\n  Rename btrfs_root_is_snapshot to btrfs_root_is_snapper_snapshot.\n  This happens in preparation for the changes suggested in #2697\n  where we want to get rid of snapper specific btrfs code which\n  will be available in snapper natively soon. To make sure a btrfs\n  layout specific to snapper(and SUSE), the implicitly used attribute\n  named btrfs_root_is_snapshot now becomes explicit and its new\n  name will indicate that snapper sits behind it. Along with the\n  rename a XSLT stylesheet to automatically convert the old name\n  into the new name for schema v8.3 will be performed.\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.5 â 10.2.6\n\n- Fixed donate button target\n\n- Added LUKS reencryption support\n  Added rd.kiwi.oem.luks.reencrypt boot option consumed by the\n  kiwi-repart dracut module. For OEM LUKS2 encrypted disk images.\n  If set, reencrypts the disk prior an eventual resize and therefore\n  creates a new key pool and master key. The reencryption is advisable\n  if the image binary is not protected. With access to the image\n  binary it's possible to extract the luks header which then allows to\n  decrypt the data unless it was reencrypted. The reencryption process\n  only runs if the checksum of the luks header still matches the one\n  from the original disk image. Be aware that the reencryption will\n  ask for the passphrase if the image has been built with an initial\n  luks passphrase.\n\n- Fixed arm/tumbleweed/test-image-rpi\n  No ruby required for this integration test build\n\n- Plain zipl loader needs boot partition\n  If the rootfs is something zipl cannot read, we need an\n  extra boot partition using a supported filesystem\n\n- Fixed IBM-Cloud-Standard profile\n  The test-image-MicroOS integration test builds an IBM-Cloud-Standard\n  profile as encrypted variant with a random key that is not protected\n  by an encrypted boot image. This doesn't make sense. Thus the\n  encryption setup for the IBM cloud standard build got removed.\n  Use the IBM-Cloud-Secure-Execution profile to test encrypted\n  secure linux builds\n\n- Fixed test-image-qcow-openstack\n  rsh package was dropped from TW\n\n- Fix genprotimg for s390 builds\n  A recent change on genprotimg now forbids to use --cert in\n  combination with --no-verify, even though this was allowed\n  before.\n\n- Fix documentation for repo, package gpg settings\n  In contrast to the documentation, kiwi sets default values\n  for any gpg setting if not explicitly specified differently.\n  We want to avoid to inherit a behavior from how the distribution\n  packages the package manager. This commit fixes the documentation\n  to be in line with the implementation\n\n- Drop insecure and unsupported md5 digest\n  Decommission the Checksum.md5() method and move all places\n  in code to sha256(). The md5 digest is considered insecure\n  and has also been removed from hashlib as a supported digest.\n  This Fixes #2696\n\n- Fix config functions action\n  The action failed on the setup of the runtime because the upgrade\n  of pip failed.\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.4 â 10.2.5\n\n- Changed systemfiles provider\n  Instead of providing a static list of filenames, provide a list\n  of package names. It is expected that the pilot of flake-pilot\n  resolves this list against the local package database to build\n  up the filelist for provisioning\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.3 â 10.2.4\n\n- Update system files setup for containers\n  The attribute provide_system_files creates a meta file in the\n  root tree named 'systemfiles'. The contents of this file were\n  produced by just a dump of the package database so far. For\n  a more generic use of this data some adaptions were needed.\n  First we allow to skip packages matching a pattern from being\n  part of the system files. Next we do not put ghost and doc\n  files into account. And last we handle library files in a different\n  file named 'systemfiles.libs' where we do not add symlink targets\n  if the target path is also part of the package. The consumer\n  of this information is flake-pilot which syncs that library system\n  files from the host via --copy-links. This allows a more generic\n  use with regards to versioned libraries e.g. libc\n\n- Drop /dev/pts from bind mount locations\n  This has created havoc in the Fedora build environments by\n  fully unmounting /dev/pts and breaking the builders for\n  subsquent tasks.\n  This is a partial revert of commit daf1323c5ded7e4e7783205f5e30457b40eb322f.\n\n- Don't take ghost files into account\n  When creating the system files information do not\n  take ghost files and artifact files into account\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.2 â 10.2.3\n\n- Update STYLEROOT to SUSE 2022\n\n- Fix broken links in the documentation\n\n- Fix legacy_bios_mode detection\n  The code in this method does not work correctly if the\n  firmware is set to 'bios'. In bios only mode the method\n  returned a false value which is incorrect as it should\n  return a true value in this case. Without this patch\n  ISO images will fail to boot because no loader gets\n  configured.\n\n- Added /dev/pts to bind mount locations\n  During runtime several kernel filesystems are bind mounted into\n  the image root system such that programs expecting it can work.\n  /dev/pts was not needed so far but seems to be a good addition\n  to the list to make tools like sudo to work properly when called\n  e.g. from a config.sh script. This Fixes #2686\n\n- xorriso: respect efiparttable and gpt_hybrid_mbr\n  This should make the xorriso-based ISO build path respect the\n  'efiparttable' and 'gpt_hybrid_mbr' settings when building a\n  UEFI-compatible image, making it write a GPT disk label by default\n  instead of an MBR (msdos) one. If it's building an image that is not\n  UEFI-compatible it will always write an MBR label, regardless of\n  this setting.\n  If 'gpt_hybrid_mbr' is set, xorriso will write an Ubuntu-style\n  MBR/GPT hybrid partition table, where the MBR partition table\n  includes a partition with type 00 and the bootable flag, as well\n  as the partition with type ee required by the UEFI spec. This\n  mildly violates the UEFI spec but may make the image bootable on\n  native BIOS or CSM firmwares which refuse to boot from a disk with\n  no partition marked 'bootable' in the MBR. If 'gpt_hybrid_mbr' is\n  not set, xorriso will write a strictly UEFI-spec compliant label,\n  with just the 'protective MBR' required by the UEFI spec (no\n  bootable partition) and the correct GPT partition table. Note\n  this is somewhat different from what gpt_hybrid_mbr does for\n  disk images.\n  Also, we now pass -compliance no_emul_toc when building ISOs, as\n  recommended by upstream in\n  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-xorriso/2024-11/msg00012.html\n  This tool is generally always going to be building ISOs intended\n  for write-once use, not multi-session use (and which are rarely,\n  these days, written to physical discs at all anyway).\n  Signed-off-by: Adam Williamson \u0026lt;awilliam@redhat.com\u0026gt;\n\n- Added provide/require system files for containers\n  Added the attributes provide_system_files and require_system_files\n  to control the provider and requester of system files in\n  container image builds. systemfiles is a metadata file which\n  contains all files from the package database at call time.\n  It is used in flake-pilot to provision the systemfiles data\n  from the host into the container instance. One possible use\n  case for this data is a flake registration which uses a\n  base container that is derived from a runtime container but\n  all data from the runtime should be provisioned from the\n  host. Using this feature tightly couples the flake to the\n  host OS distribution and version.\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.1 â 10.2.2\n\n- Fix scope issue\n  Increase livetime of the the compressor instances\n  to the livetime of RootImportOCI. They create temporary\n  files which are referenced later and need to live longer\n  than the block they got created in\n\n- Bump version: 10.2.0 â 10.2.1\n\n- Fixed use of fscreateoptions for iso type\n  The information for fscreateoptions was not passed along to the\n  tooling if a custom filesystem attribute was specified.\n  This Fixes #2681\n\n- Allow to derive from multiple containers\n  Add support for multi inheritance to the derived_from attribute\n  In the order of a comma seperated list of docker source URI's\n  a base tree is created. This was possible only with one container\n  so far and Fixes #2680 as well as jira#OBS-354\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.18 â 10.2.0\n\n- Add selinux test build to TW\n  Also update derived docker integration test to latest Leap\n\n- kiwi/schema: Fix allowed value type for ISO publisher and application ID\n  According to the spec, this should be constrained to 128 characters\n  but also allow quite a few other special characters (as well as spaces).\n  We didn't allow spaces in application ID, but allowed too much for Publisher.\n  Now we set up both correctly.\n\n- Fix setup of kiwi environment variables\n  Some kiwi env vars are initialized with an empty value\n  and not overwritten if another value is provided. For\n  the selected variables an empty value setting is not\n  allowed because the schema also enforces the value to\n  be set at least once. In addition a helpful option\n  named --print-kiwi-env was added to the 'image info'\n  command which allows to print the environment variables\n  and their values.\n\n- Add random key support for LUKS encryption\n  Allow to pass luks=\u0026quot;random\u0026quot;. In random mode use the\n  generated keyfile as the only key to decrypt. This is\n  only secure if the generated initrd also gets protected\n  e.g. through encryption like it is done with the secure\n  linux execution on zSystems\n\n- Added development group in pyproject setup\n  generateDS and other tools are needed and were forgotten\n  to be added when we deleted the tox dependency\n\n- Added containers integration with OBS\n  When building in the Open Build Service (OBS) there is no way\n  to create outgoing connections from the build workers. To allow\n  the \u0026lt;containers\u0026gt; section to fetch containers from the SUSE\n  registry we need to apply an OCI URI translation into a local\n  path. The actual OCI container image is expected to be provided\n  by the obs backend on the worker. Along with this commit also an\n  integration test named test-image-disk-containers is provided.\n  This Fixes jira#OBS-351\n\n- Fix rendering of SUSE docs\n  The SUSE documentation is produced through a conversion\n  of the ReST source into docbook. The name kiwi is reserved\n  in the index and needs to be referenced as kiwi-ng when\n  used as command.\n\n- Remove tox dependency\n  tox was used as sort of a make target to run unit tests\n  and more in a python virtualenv. However, since we switched\n  everything to poetry it's no longer needed to let tox create\n  the python virtual environments. This commit moves the tox\n  targets into the Makefile and adapts the github workflow\n  files accordingly. In addition the scripts container based\n  tests were re-activated and fixed such that they succeed\n  again.\n\n- Fix make build target\n  Move the actions done by the tox target into the\n  build target and call them there in a clean and easy\n  to spot sequence. There is no need to call tox to\n  prepare for the package submission, instead the\n  checks and poetry runs to prepare for the package\n  target should be called directly as part of the\n  build target. In the future we might get rid of\n  tox completely.\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.17 â 10.1.18\n\n- Fixed zipl caller environment\n  zipl gets confused with an active sysfs mount inside\n  the root tree at call time of zipl. This commit\n  umounts the /sys bind mount in the image tree prior\n  calling zipl\n\n- Fix s390 test-image-disk build\n  Add missing kernel links used by suse tools\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.16 â 10.1.17\n\n- Fix coloring of build_status.sh flags\n  Depending on the place of the status flag the color\n  setup might fail. This commit fixes it\n\n- Add pytest-container as optional dependency\n  The pyproject.toml listed pytest-container as dependency\n  but it is used only to run the container based integration\n  tests for the shell helper methods. For building the package\n  this dependency should not be pulled in\n\n- Fix networking in erofs integration test\n  The network setup was systemd-networkd based but\n  the provided network config was not for systemd\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.15 â 10.1.16\n\n- Fix erofs requires in spec\n  erofs-utils for SUSE only exists in Tumbleweed. The\n  former conditon would also add the requirement for ALP\n  and SLFO which is wrong. This commit fixes it\n\n- Add vagrantconfig rule for vagrant format\n  If the format=\u0026quot;vagrant\u0026quot; attribute is set, a vagrantconfig\n  section becomes mandatory. This commit enforces this rule\n  on the schema. This Fixes #2666\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.14 â 10.1.15\n\n- Fixed sphinx_rtd_theme setup\n  Delete obsolete display_version attribute\n\n- Evaluate eficsm everywhere\n  Fixed _supports_bios_modules() to take an eventually\n  provided eficsm setup into account. The grub config still\n  searches for i386 grub modules even if eficsm=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot;\n  is set.\n\n- Fixed debian bootstrap script calls\n  Run scripts as commands with their native shebang and not\n  through bash. Not all debian package scripts uses bash, some\n  of them uses sh which can be a link to dash or other\n  interpreters. This Fixes #2660\n\n- Update TW integration tests\n  The package x86info was dropped from TW\n\n- Turn DiskFormat into an ordinary class\n  - it does not need to be an abstract base class\n  - use f-strings where applicable instead of format()\n  - change return type of _custom_args_for_format from list to tuple\n\n- Add new containers section\n  Allow to specify references to OCI containers in the\n  image description like in the following example:\n  \u0026lt;containers source=\u0026quot;registry.suse.com\u0026quot; backend=\u0026quot;podman\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;container name=\u0026quot;some\u0026quot; tag=\u0026quot;some\u0026quot; path=\u0026quot;/some/path\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;/containers\u0026gt;\n  During the kiwi process the containers are fetched into a\n  temporary location and a systemd service is configured to\n  one time load the containers into the local registry at\n  first boot of the system. This Fixes #2663\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.13 â 10.1.14\n\n- Revert \u0026quot;Install usrmerge for Debian integration test\u0026quot;\n  This reverts commit 95ac861741f14c4f35611c16328384c18e53dcfb.\n  Solution needs to be provided in code\n\n- Install usrmerge for Debian integration test\n\n- Support older apt versions for bootstrap\n  This Fixes #2660\n\n- Run package scripts in apt bootstrap phase\n  The bootstrap procedure based on apt only runs a manual\n  collection of package scripts. This commit refactors the\n  code that unpacks the bootstrap packages to a python\n  implementation and adds a method to run the bootstrap\n  scripts from all packages resolved by apt.\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.12 â 10.1.13\n\n- Fix bundle extension for vagrant type\n  When bundling result files that uses a vagrant type,\n  kiwi creates them with the extension .vagrant.virtualbox.box\n  or .vagrant.libvirt.box. The bundler code renames them using\n  only the .box suffix which is too short as it is missing\n  the subformat information. This commit fixes it and keeps\n  this information in the result bundle file name.\n  This Fixes #2656\n\n- Use simple quotas (squota) for volumes\n\n- Add quota attribute to volume section\n  Allow to set quota per volume for the btrfs filesystem\n  This Fixes #2651\n\n- Fix globbing with exclude with regex\n  This fixes a collection of bugs when producing erofs images.\n  On one hand, this ensures that an exclude of `/sys` doesn't accidentally\n  match `/lib/libsystemd.so`, only `/sys/whatever`.\n  On the other hand, this ensures that `/dev/*` does match `/dev/vda` and\n  not just `/dev///////////`.\n  This fixes libsystemd.so getting dropped in Kiwi-built FEX images.\n  Signed-off-by: Alyssa Rosenzweig \u0026lt;alyssa@rosenzweig.io\u0026gt;\n\n- Honour custom exclude for filesystem builds\n  All other call sites honour the custom exclude file, it's just this one\n  that needs to be fixed. This unblocks use of Kiwi for generating FEX\n  rootfs.\n  Closes: #2652\n  Signed-off-by: Alyssa Rosenzweig \u0026lt;alyssa@rosenzweig.io\u0026gt;\n\n- test: storage: update clone_device tests with new block size\n  Signed-off-by: Isaac True \u0026lt;isaac@is.having.coffee\u0026gt;\n\n- storage: clone_device: increase dd block size\n  Increasing the block size used for dd reduces the time needed to clone a\n  device.\n  Signed-off-by: Isaac True \u0026lt;isaac@is.having.coffee\u0026gt;\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.11 â 10.1.12\n\n- Add missing erofscompression validation\n  In the filesystem builder I forgot to evaluate the\n  erofscompression attribute. This Fixes #2647\n\n- Include PI and comments in XSL stylesheets\n  So far comments and processing instructions (PI) were\n  ignored when applying the XSL stylesheets. This commit\n  updates all stylesheets to take them into account\n\n- Bump version: 10.1.10 â 10.1.11\n\n- doc: Add login information test build test images\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- Update to version 059+suse.631.ga638ed12:  * fix(dmsquash-live): do not check ISO md5 if image filesystem (bsc#1240919)\n  * fix(nfs): set correct ownership of rpc.statd state directories (bsc#1217885)\n  * perf(nfs): remove references to old rpcbind state dir\n  * fix(nfs): libnfsidmap plugins not added in some distributions\n  * fix(dracut.spec): move znet to the main package (bsc#1239632)\n\n- Update to version 059+suse.623.gf9a73df5:\n  * fix(iscsi): make sure services are shut down when switching root (bsc#1237695)\n  * fix(iscsi): don't require network setup for qedi\n  * fix(network-legacy): do not require pgrep when using wicked (bsc#1236982)\n\n- Update to version 059+suse.617.gb2c1d974:\n  Fixes for booting from iSCSI offload with bnx2i (bsc#1228086):\n  * fix(iscsi): attempt iSCSI login before all interfaces are up\n  * fix(iscsi): don't require network setup for bnx2i\n  Other:\n  * fix(dracut): rework timeout for devices added via --mount and --add-device (bsc#1231792)\n\n- Update to version 059+suse.610.g850d981a:\n  * fix(dm): remove 59-persistent-storage-dm.rules (bsc#1232063)\n\nPackage findutils was updated:\n\n- do not crash when file system loop was encountered [bsc#1231472]- added patches\n  fix https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/findutils.git/commit/?id=e5d6eb919b9\n  + findutils-avoid-crash-system-loop.patch\n- modified patches\n  % findutils-xautofs.patch (p1)\n\nPackage gettext-runtime was updated:\n\n- Fix crash while handling po files with malformed header and  process them properly\n  (0003-Fix-malformed-header-processing.patch, boo#1227316).\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2024-52533.patch: fix a single byte buffer overflow  (boo#1233282 CVE-2024-52533 glgo#GNOME/glib#3461).\n\nPackage glibc was updated:\n\n- assert-message-allocation.patch: Fix underallocation of abort_msg_s  struct (CVE-2025-0395, bsc#1236282, BZ #32582))\n\nPackage google-guest-agent was updated:\n\n- Add patch to fix unexpected memory consumption during token  parsing in golang.org/x/oauth2 (bsc#1239197, CVE-2025-22868)\n  * CVE-2025-22868.patch\n\n- Update to version 20250116.00: (bsc#1236403)\n  * networkd(vlan): remove the interface in addition to config (#468)\n  * Implement support for vlan dynamic removal, update dhclient to remove\n    only if configured (#465)\n  * Update logging library (#479)\n  * Remove Pat from owners file.

configure the\n  kernel is used to build modules a warning is issued and the build\n  continues. This could be turned into an error but that would be too\n  restrictive.\n  The generated kernel-devel makefile could set the compiler but then the\n  main Makefile as to be patched to assign CC with ?=\n  This causes run_oldconfig failure on SUSE-2024 and kbuild config check\n  failure on SUSE-2025.\n  This cannot be hardcoded to one version in a regular patch because the\n  value is expected to be configurable at mkspec time. Patch the Makefile\n  after aplyin patches in rpm prep step instead. A check is added to\n  verify that the sed command did indeed apply the change.\n- commit 6031391\n\n- tracing/osnoise: Fix resetting of tracepoints (CVE-2025-21733\n  bsc#1238494).\n- commit

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section-\u003eusage\n\nThe below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory\nregion with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb\n    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.\n\n    The clone skb-\u003e_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the\n    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.\n 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.\n\nThe Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.\n\nThis race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that\ncase later steps perform skb_clone() with skb-\u003e_nfct already confirmed (in\nhash table).  This works fine.\n\nBut such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the\npackets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.\n\nPablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful\nnat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call\nconntrack again.\n\nThis doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat\ntransformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting\nvia 'sabotage_in' hook.\n\nWork around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN\ntime, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.\n\nThe downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.\n\nAlternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with\nunconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this\nopens up other problems, for example:\n\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5\n\nFor multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be\ncreated, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.\n\nUsers should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic\nNOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass\nthem, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,\nso user-visible behaviour would change.",

This results in an infinite loop:\n\nentry_tc -\u003e subprog_tc -\u003e entry_freplace --tailcall-\u003e entry_tc.\n\nThe problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to\nzero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism\nto never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, the solution is twofold:\n\n1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a\n   prog_array map.\n2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map\n   with an freplace program.\n\nThis ensures that:\n\n* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,\n  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.\n* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its\n  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.\n\nMoreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return\n-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a\nprog_array map.\n\nAdditionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a\ntab for proper formatting.",

Another issue\nis that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannot\nassume to be ASCII coded.\n\nThe log functionality is probably never being hit when DLM is used in\nnormal way and no debug logging is enabled. The null pointer dereference\ncan only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resource\nassigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but we\nshould be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and we\nactually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.\n\nIn this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb id\nis enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if this\nexists.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-\u003e ...\n   -\u003e dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -\u003e ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n         -\u003e lan9303_phy_read()\n            -\u003e chip-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n               -\u003e lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -\u003e dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp-\u003econduit-\u003edsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev-\u003edsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev-\u003edsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit-\u003edsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n(\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit-\u003edsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up).",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid\n\nThere is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations\nand a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the\nfollowint use-after-free KASAN warning:\n\nkernel: ==================================================================\nkernel: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in nfsd_breaker_owns_lease+0x140/0x160 [nfsd]\nkernel: Read of size 8 at addr ffff0000e73cd0c8 by task nfsd/6205\nkernel:\nkernel: CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 6205 Comm: nfsd Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #9\nkernel: Hardware name: Apple Inc.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/mremap: fix address wraparound in move_page_tables()\n\nOn 32-bit platforms, it is possible for the expression `len + old_addr \u003c\nold_end` to be false-positive if `len + old_addr` wraps around. \n`old_addr` is the cursor in the old range up to which page table entries\nhave been moved; so if the operation succeeded, `old_addr` is the *end* of\nthe old region, and adding `len` to it can wrap.\n\nThe overflow causes mremap() to mistakenly believe that PTEs have been\ncopied; the consequence is that mremap() bails out, but doesn't move the\nPTEs back before the new VMA is unmapped, causing anonymous pages in the\nregion to be lost.  So basically if userspace tries to mremap() a\nprivate-anon region and hits this bug, mremap() will return an error and\nthe private-anon region's contents appear to have been zeroed.\n\nThe idea of this check is that `old_end - len` is the original start\naddress, and writing the check that way also makes it easier to read; so\nfix the check by rearranging the comparison accordingly.\n\n(An alternate fix would be to refactor this function by introducing an\n\"orig_old_start\" variable or such.)\n\n\nTested in a VM with a 32-bit X86 kernel; without the patch:\n\n```\nuser@horn:~/big_mremap$ cat test.c\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n#include \u003cstdlib.h\u003e\n#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e\n#include \u003cerr.h\u003e\n#include \u003csys/mman.h\u003e\n\n#define ADDR1 ((void*)0x60000000)\n#define ADDR2 ((void*)0x10000000)\n#define SIZE          0x50000000uL\n\nint main(void) {\n  unsigned char *p1 = mmap(ADDR1, SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,\n      MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE, -1, 0);\n  if (p1 == MAP_FAILED)\n    err(1, \"mmap 1\");\n  unsigned char *p2 = mmap(ADDR2, SIZE, PROT_NONE,\n      MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE, -1, 0);\n  if (p2 == MAP_FAILED)\n    err(1, \"mmap 2\");\n  *p1 = 0x41;\n  printf(\"first char is 0x%02hhx\\n\", *p1);\n  unsigned char *p3 = mremap(p1, SIZE, SIZE,\n      MREMAP_MAYMOVE|MREMAP_FIXED, p2);\n  if (p3 == MAP_FAILED) {\n    printf(\"mremap() failed; first char is 0x%02hhx\\n\", *p1);\n  } else {\n    printf(\"mremap() succeeded; first char is 0x%02hhx\\n\", *p3);\n  }\n}\nuser@horn:~/big_mremap$ gcc -static -o test test.c\nuser@horn:~/big_mremap$ setarch -R ./test\nfirst char is 0x41\nmremap() failed; first char is 0x00\n```\n\nWith the patch:\n\n```\nuser@horn:~/big_mremap$ setarch -R ./test\nfirst char is 0x41\nmremap() succeeded; first char is 0x41\n```",

In the current\nimplementation, the block_device structure is set after the function\nreturns to the caller.\n\nHere, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer\nhead as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the\ncaller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it\nwas reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call\ntouch_buffer() here in the first place.\n\nSo this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.",

It provides the families\nthe following ops:\n - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process\n - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0\n - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup\nThe whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump\ndon't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered\nin response to recvmsg() on the socket.\n\nThis gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that\nthe user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.\nTo make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there\nis an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.\n\nThe complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done\nis allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when\nneeded.\n\nUnfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not\nthe cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.\nWe have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone\nelse holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back\nto square one.\n\nThe whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user\ncan interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.\nAnd close always happens in process context. Some async code may\nstill access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.\nbut no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.\n\nDelete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release\nhandler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance\nwe now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,\nso dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-fabrics: fix kernel crash while shutting down controller\n\nThe nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval,\ncould potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller.\nThis may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue\ndestroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx\nqueue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing\noperation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below:\n\nCall Trace:\n    autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable)\n    __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c\n    blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84\n    blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220\n    nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core]\n    process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0\n    worker_thread+0x340/0x504\n    kthread+0x138/0x140\n    start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18\n\nWhile shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks\nin then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is\nthen invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which\ndecrements the admin-\u003eq_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only\nrequest in the admin queue then the admin-\u003eq_usage_counter becomes zero.\nIf that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_\nqueue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another\ncpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward\nprogress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward\nwe are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the\nissue here's that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue\ndispatch operation hasn't yet finished its work and so it could still\npotentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had\nbeen already deleted and that causes the above crash.\n\nThe above kernel crash is regression caused due to changes implemented\nin commit a54a93d0e359 (\"nvme: move stopping keep-alive into\nnvme_uninit_ctrl()\"). Ideally we should stop keep-alive before destroyin\ng the admin queue and freeing the admin tagset so that it wouldn't sneak\nin during the shutdown operation. However we removed the keep alive stop\noperation from the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in commit\na54a93d0e359 (\"nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()\")\nand added it under nvme_uninit_ctrl() which executes very late in the\nshutdown code path after the admin queue is destroyed and its tagset is\nremoved. So this change created the possibility of keep-alive sneaking in\nand interfering with the shutdown operation and causing observed kernel\ncrash.\n\nTo fix the observed crash, we decided to move nvme_stop_keep_alive() from\nnvme_uninit_ctrl() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). This change would ensure\nthat we don't forward progress and delete the admin queue until the keep-\nalive operation is finished (if it's in-flight) or cancelled and that would\nhelp contain the race condition explained above and hence avoid the crash.\n\nMoving nvme_stop_keep_alive() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() instead of\nadding nvme_stop_keep_alive() to the beginning of the controller shutdown\ncode path in nvme_stop_ctrl(), as was the case earlier before commit\na54a93d0e359 (\"nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()\"),\nwould help save one callsite of nvme_stop_keep_alive().",

It leaks if returned from\nopen_cached_dir().\n\nFix this by setting cfid-\u003ehas_lease when the ref is actually taken; the\ncfid will not be used by other threads until it has a valid time.\n\nAddresses these kmemleaks:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881090c4000 (size 1024):\n  comm \"bash\", pid 1860, jiffies 4295126592\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 01 00 00 00 00 ad de 22 01 00 00 00 00 ad de  ........\".......\n    00 ca 45 22 81 88 ff ff f8 dc 4f 04 81 88 ff ff  ..E\"......O.....\n  backtrace (crc 6f58c20f):\n    [\u003cffffffff8b895a1e\u003e] __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2be/0x350\n    [\u003cffffffff8bda06e3\u003e] open_cached_dir+0x993/0x1fb0\n    [\u003cffffffff8bdaa750\u003e] cifs_readdir+0x15a0/0x1d50\n    [\u003cffffffff8b9a853f\u003e] iterate_dir+0x28f/0x4b0\n    [\u003cffffffff8b9a9aed\u003e] __x64_sys_getdents64+0xfd/0x200\n    [\u003cffffffff8cf6da05\u003e] do_syscall_64+0x95/0x1a0\n    [\u003cffffffff8d00012f\u003e] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881044fdcf8 (size 8):\n  comm \"bash\", pid 1860, jiffies 4295126592\n  hex dump (first 8 bytes):\n    00 cc cc cc cc cc cc cc                          ........\n  backtrace (crc 10c106a9):\n    [\u003cffffffff8b89a3d3\u003e] __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0x363/0x480\n    [\u003cffffffff8b7d7256\u003e] kstrdup+0x36/0x60\n    [\u003cffffffff8bda0700\u003e] open_cached_dir+0x9b0/0x1fb0\n    [\u003cffffffff8bdaa750\u003e] cifs_readdir+0x15a0/0x1d50\n    [\u003cffffffff8b9a853f\u003e] iterate_dir+0x28f/0x4b0\n    [\u003cffffffff8b9a9aed\u003e] __x64_sys_getdents64+0xfd/0x200\n    [\u003cffffffff8cf6da05\u003e] do_syscall_64+0x95/0x1a0\n    [\u003cffffffff8d00012f\u003e] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nAnd addresses these BUG splats when unmounting the SMB filesystem:\n\nBUG: Dentry ffff888140590ba0{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]\nWARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 3433 at fs/dcache.c:1536 umount_check+0xd0/0x100\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 3433 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.12.0-rc4-g850925a8133c-dirty #49\nHardware name: VMware, Inc.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtlwifi: Drastically reduce the attempts to read efuse in case of failures\n\nSyzkaller reported a hung task with uevent_show() on stack trace. That\nspecific issue was addressed by another commit [0], but even with that\nfix applied (for example, running v6.12-rc5) we face another type of hung\ntask that comes from the same reproducer [1]. By investigating that, we\ncould narrow it to the following path:\n\n(a) Syzkaller emulates a Realtek USB WiFi adapter using raw-gadget and\ndummy_hcd infrastructure.\n\n(b) During the probe of rtl8192cu, the driver ends-up performing an efuse\nread procedure (which is related to EEPROM load IIUC), and here lies the\nissue: the function read_efuse() calls read_efuse_byte() many times, as\nloop iterations depending on the efuse size (in our example, 512 in total).\n\nThis procedure for reading efuse bytes relies in a loop that performs an\nI/O read up to *10k* times in case of failures. We measured the time of\nthe loop inside read_efuse_byte() alone, and in this reproducer (which\ninvolves the dummy_hcd emulation layer), it takes 15 seconds each. As a\nconsequence, we have the driver stuck in its probe routine for big time,\nexposing a stack trace like below if we attempt to reboot the system, for\nexample:\n\ntask:kworker/0:3 state:D stack:0 pid:662 tgid:662 ppid:2 flags:0x00004000\nWorkqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nCall Trace:\n __schedule+0xe22/0xeb6\n schedule_timeout+0xe7/0x132\n __wait_for_common+0xb5/0x12e\n usb_start_wait_urb+0xc5/0x1ef\n ? usb_alloc_urb+0x95/0xa4\n usb_control_msg+0xff/0x184\n _usbctrl_vendorreq_sync+0xa0/0x161\n _usb_read_sync+0xb3/0xc5\n read_efuse_byte+0x13c/0x146\n read_efuse+0x351/0x5f0\n efuse_read_all_map+0x42/0x52\n rtl_efuse_shadow_map_update+0x60/0xef\n rtl_get_hwinfo+0x5d/0x1c2\n rtl92cu_read_eeprom_info+0x10a/0x8d5\n ? rtl92c_read_chip_version+0x14f/0x17e\n rtl_usb_probe+0x323/0x851\n usb_probe_interface+0x278/0x34b\n really_probe+0x202/0x4a4\n __driver_probe_device+0x166/0x1b2\n driver_probe_device+0x2f/0xd8\n [...]\n\nWe propose hereby to drastically reduce the attempts of doing the I/O\nreads in case of failures, restricted to USB devices (given that\nthey're inherently slower than PCIe ones). By retrying up to 10 times\n(instead of 10000), we got reponsiveness in the reproducer, while seems\nreasonable to believe that there's no sane USB device implementation in\nthe field requiring this amount of retries at every I/O read in order\nto properly work. Based on that assumption, it'd be good to have it\nbackported to stable but maybe not since driver implementation (the 10k\nnumber comes from day 0), perhaps up to 6.x series makes sense.\n\n[0] Commit 15fffc6a5624 (\"driver core: Fix uevent_show() vs driver detach race\")\n\n[1] A note about that: this syzkaller report presents multiple reproducers\nthat differs by the type of emulated USB device. For this specific case,\ncheck the entry from 2024/08/08 06:23 in the list of crashes; the C repro\nis available at https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC\u0026x=1521fc83980000.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix use-after-free of slot-\u003ebus on hot remove\n\nDennis reports a boot crash on recent Lenovo laptops with a USB4 dock.\n\nSince commit 0fc70886569c (\"thunderbolt: Reset USB4 v2 host router\") and\ncommit 59a54c5f3dbd (\"thunderbolt: Reset topology created by the boot\nfirmware\"), USB4 v2 and v1 Host Routers are reset on probe of the\nthunderbolt driver.\n\nThe reset clears the Presence Detect State and Data Link Layer Link Active\nbits at the USB4 Host Router's Root Port and thus causes hot removal of the\ndock.\n\nThe crash occurs when pciehp is unbound from one of the dock's Downstream\nPorts:  pciehp creates a pci_slot on bind and destroys it on unbind.  The\npci_slot contains a pointer to the pci_bus below the Downstream Port, but\na reference on that pci_bus is never acquired.  The pci_bus is destroyed\nbefore the pci_slot, so a use-after-free ensues when pci_slot_release()\naccesses slot-\u003ebus.\n\nIn principle this should not happen because pci_stop_bus_device() unbinds\npciehp (and therefore destroys the pci_slot) before the pci_bus is\ndestroyed by pci_remove_bus_device().\n\nHowever the stacktrace provided by Dennis shows that pciehp is unbound from\npci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  To understand\nthe significance of this, one needs to know that the PCI core uses a two\nstep process to remove a portion of the hierarchy:  It first unbinds all\ndrivers in the sub-hierarchy in pci_stop_bus_device() and then actually\nremoves the devices in pci_remove_bus_device().  There is no precaution to\nprevent driver binding in-between pci_stop_bus_device() and\npci_remove_bus_device().\n\nIn Dennis' case, it seems removal of the hierarchy by pciehp races with\ndriver binding by pci_bus_add_devices().  pciehp is bound to the\nDownstream Port after pci_stop_bus_device() has run, so it is unbound by\npci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  Because the\npci_bus has already been destroyed at that point, accesses to it result in\na use-after-free.\n\nOne might conclude that driver binding needs to be prevented after\npci_stop_bus_device() has run.  However it seems risky that pci_slot points\nto pci_bus without holding a reference.  Solely relying on correct ordering\nof driver unbind versus pci_bus destruction is certainly not defensive\nprogramming.\n\nIf pci_slot has a need to access data in pci_bus, it ought to acquire a\nreference.  Amend pci_create_slot() accordingly.  Dennis reports that the\ncrash is not reproducible with this change.\n\nAbridged stacktrace:\n\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: PME: Signaling with IRQ 156\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: pciehp: Slot #12 AttnBtn- PwrCtrl- MRL- AttnInd- PwrInd- HotPlug+ Surprise+ Interlock- NoCompl+ IbPresDis- LLActRep+\n  pci_bus 0000:20: dev 00, created physical slot 12\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: pciehp: Slot(12): Card not present\n  ...\n  pcieport 0000:21:02.0: pciehp: pcie_disable_notification: SLOTCTRL d8 write cmd 0\n  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 13 UID: 0 PID: 134 Comm: irq/156-pciehp Not tainted 6.11.0-devel+ #1\n  RIP: 0010:dev_driver_string+0x12/0x40\n  pci_destroy_slot\n  pciehp_remove\n  pcie_port_remove_service\n  device_release_driver_internal\n  bus_remove_device\n  device_del\n  device_unregister\n  remove_iter\n  device_for_each_child\n  pcie_portdrv_remove\n  pci_device_remove\n  device_release_driver_internal\n  bus_remove_device\n  device_del\n  pci_remove_bus_device (recursive invocation)\n  pci_remove_bus_device\n  pciehp_unconfigure_device\n  pciehp_disable_slot\n  pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change\n  pciehp_ist",

In the\nxenbus_dev_probe() function, within the if (err) branch at line 313, the\nprogram incorrectly returns err directly without releasing the resources\nallocated by err = drv-\u003eprobe(dev, id). As the return value is non-zero,\nthe upper layers assume the processing logic has failed. However, the probe\noperation was performed earlier without a corresponding remove operation.\nSince the probe actually allocates resources, failing to perform the remove\noperation could lead to problems.\n\nTo fix this issue, we followed the resource release logic of the\nxenbus_dev_remove() function by adding a new block fail_remove before the\nfail_put block. After entering the branch if (err) at line 313, the\nfunction will use a goto statement to jump to the fail_remove block,\nensuring that the previously acquired resources are correctly released,\nthus preventing the reference count leak.\n\nThis bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed\nby our team.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/pci: Properly hide first-in-list PCIe extended capability\n\nThere are cases where a PCIe extended capability should be hidden from\nthe user. For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and\nto an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.\n\nFix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater\nthan PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct\nread only access instead of the ecap_perms array.\n\nNote that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can\nexceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which\nare already checked before).\n\n[1]\n\nWARNING: CPU: 118 PID: 5329 at drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1900 vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\nCPU: 118 UID: 0 PID: 5329 Comm: simx-qemu-syste Not tainted 6.12.0+ #1\n(snip)\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n ? __warn+0x8d/0x140\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x244/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_rw+0x101/0x1b0 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_core_read+0x1d/0x30 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_device_fops_read+0x27/0x40 [vfio]\n vfs_read+0xbd/0x340\n ? vfio_device_fops_unl_ioctl+0xbb/0x740 [vfio]\n ? __rseq_handle_notify_resume+0xa4/0x4b0\n __x64_sys_pread64+0x96/0xc0\n x64_sys_call+0x1c3d/0x20d0\n do_syscall_64+0x4d/0x120\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

However,\n   `e_show`/`c_show` will access `ex_uuid` after `cache_put`, which can\n   trigger a use-after-free issue, shown below.\n\n   ==================================================================\n   BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in svc_export_show+0x362/0x430 [nfsd]\n   Read of size 1 at addr ff11000010fdc120 by task cat/870\n\n   CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 870 Comm: cat Not tainted 6.12.0-rc3+ #1\n   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS\n   1.16.1-2.fc37 04/01/2014\n   Call Trace:\n    \u003cTASK\u003e\n    dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70\n    print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x3a0\n    print_report+0xb9/0x280\n    kasan_report+0xae/0xe0\n    svc_export_show+0x362/0x430 [nfsd]\n    c_show+0x161/0x390 [sunrpc]\n    seq_read_iter+0x589/0x770\n    seq_read+0x1e5/0x270\n    proc_reg_read+0xe1/0x140\n    vfs_read+0x125/0x530\n    ksys_read+0xc1/0x160\n    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\n   Allocated by task 830:\n    kasan_save_stack+0x20/0x40\n    kasan_save_track+0x14/0x30\n    __kasan_kmalloc+0x8f/0xa0\n    __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0x1bc/0x400\n    kmemdup_noprof+0x22/0x50\n    svc_export_parse+0x8a9/0xb80 [nfsd]\n    cache_do_downcall+0x71/0xa0 [sunrpc]\n    cache_write_procfs+0x8e/0xd0 [sunrpc]\n    proc_reg_write+0xe1/0x140\n    vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0\n    ksys_write+0xc1/0x160\n    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\n   Freed by task 868:\n    kasan_save_stack+0x20/0x40\n    kasan_save_track+0x14/0x30\n    kasan_save_free_info+0x3b/0x60\n    __kasan_slab_free+0x37/0x50\n    kfree+0xf3/0x3e0\n    svc_export_put+0x87/0xb0 [nfsd]\n    cache_purge+0x17f/0x1f0 [sunrpc]\n    nfsd_destroy_serv+0x226/0x2d0 [nfsd]\n    nfsd_svc+0x125/0x1e0 [nfsd]\n    write_threads+0x16a/0x2a0 [nfsd]\n    nfsctl_transaction_write+0x74/0xa0 [nfsd]\n    vfs_write+0x1a5/0x6d0\n    ksys_write+0xc1/0x160\n    do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\n2.

With CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE\nstrnlen() performs an extra step to check whether the last byte of the\ninput char buffer is a null character (commit 3009f891bb9f (\"fortify:\nAllow strlen() and strnlen() to pass compile-time known lengths\")).\nThis, together with possibly other configurations, cause the following\nIR to be generated:\n\n  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #5 section \".init.text\" align 16 !kcfi_type !29 {\n    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16\n    ...\n\n  14:                                               ; preds = %11\n    %15 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63\n    %16 = load i8, ptr %15, align 1\n    %17 = tail call i1 @llvm.is.constant.i8(i8 %16)\n    %18 = icmp eq i8 %16, 0\n    %19 = select i1 %17, i1 %18, i1 false\n    br i1 %19, label %20, label %23\n\n  20:                                               ; preds = %14\n    %21 = call i64 @strlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1) #23\n    ...\n\n  23:                                               ; preds = %14, %11, %20\n    %24 = call i64 @strnlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1, i64 noundef 64) #24\n    ...\n  }\n\nThe above code calculates the address of the last char in the buffer\n(value %15) and then loads from it (value %16). Because the buffer is\nnever initialized, the LLVM GVN pass marks value %16 as undefined:\n\n  %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63\n  br i1 undef, label %14, label %17\n\nThis gives later passes (SCCP, in particular) more DCE opportunities by\npropagating the undef value further, and eventually removes everything\nafter the load on the uninitialized stack location:\n\n  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #0 section \".init.text\" align 16 !kcfi_type !11 {\n    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16\n    ...\n\n  12:                                               ; preds = %11\n    %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63\n    unreachable\n  }\n\nIn this way, the generated native code will just fall through to the\nnext function, as LLVM does not generate any code for the unreachable IR\ninstruction and leaves the function without a terminator.\n\nZero the on-stack buffer to avoid this possible UB.",

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes\nidr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a\nsimilar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s-\u003ecpu_slab-\u003elock) is\nstill a spinlock.\n\nInstead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking\nhtab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring\nthe invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map\npointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.\nTherefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these\nto-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.\n\nThere are four callers for -\u003emap_fd_put_ptr:\n\n(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIt invokes -\u003emap_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of\nhtab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),\nbecause the old element has already been stashed in htab-\u003eextra_elems.\nIt may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the\ninvocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release\nthe newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer\nof the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and\nreleasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old\nelement, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old\nelement as well.\n\n(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIts caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),\nhtab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().\n\nFor htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after\nhtab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just\nlike lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list\nand invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe\nto reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these\nelements have been removed from the hash llist.\n\nBecause htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,\n__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept\nit as\n---truncated---",

But if CONFIG_INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON\nis set to yes, kernel panic will happen:\nCall trace:\n destroy_workqueue+0x1c/0x258\n ath10k_sdio_remove+0x84/0x94\n sdio_bus_remove+0x50/0x16c\n device_release_driver_internal+0x188/0x25c\n device_driver_detach+0x20/0x2c\n\nThis is because during 'rmmod ath10k', ath10k_sdio_remove() will call\nath10k_core_destroy() before destroy_workqueue(). wiphy_dev_release()\nwill finally be called in ath10k_core_destroy(). This function will free\nstruct cfg80211_registered_device *rdev and all its members, including\nwiphy, dev and the pointer of sdio workqueue. Then the pointer of sdio\nworkqueue will be set to NULL due to CONFIG_INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON.\n\nAfter device release, destroy_workqueue() will use NULL pointer then the\nkernel panic happen.\n\nCall trace:\nath10k_sdio_remove\n  -\u003eath10k_core_unregister\n    ......\n    -\u003eath10k_core_stop\n      -\u003eath10k_hif_stop\n        -\u003eath10k_sdio_irq_disable\n    -\u003eath10k_hif_power_down\n      -\u003edel_timer_sync(\u0026ar_sdio-\u003esleep_timer)\n  -\u003eath10k_core_destroy\n    -\u003eath10k_mac_destroy\n      -\u003eieee80211_free_hw\n        -\u003ewiphy_free\n    ......\n          -\u003ewiphy_dev_release\n  -\u003edestroy_workqueue\n\nNeed to call destroy_workqueue() before ath10k_core_destroy(), free\nthe work queue buffer first and then free pointer of work queue by\nath10k_core_destroy(). This order matches the error path order in\nath10k_sdio_probe().\n\nNo work will be queued on sdio workqueue between it is destroyed and\nath10k_core_destroy() is called. Based on the call_stack above, the\nreason is:\nOnly ath10k_sdio_sleep_timer_handler(), ath10k_sdio_hif_tx_sg() and\nath10k_sdio_irq_disable() will queue work on sdio workqueue.\nSleep timer will be deleted before ath10k_core_destroy() in\nath10k_hif_power_down().\nath10k_sdio_irq_disable() only be called in ath10k_hif_stop().\nath10k_core_unregister() will call ath10k_hif_power_down() to stop hif\nbus, so ath10k_sdio_hif_tx_sg() won't be called anymore.\n\nTested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 SDIO WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00189",

This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper\nsequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the\nrisk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket\n\nDst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is\nexecuted for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There\nare several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur:\n* an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received,\n  resulting in an exception dst being created\n* a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must\n  start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions\n* after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run\n  before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst\n\nWhen TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has\nexpired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the\nrefcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment\nmade by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the\nconnection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never\nreleased. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but\nthat decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just\nbefore the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After\nip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the\ndst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is\nno longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked\nobject.\n\nAs a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the\nloopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do\nnot contain e5f80fcf869a (\"ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev\"):\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The\npatch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was\n92f1655aa2b22 (\"net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race\"). But 92f1655aa2b22\nmerely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue\nwas present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in\n54c1a859efd9f (\"ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually\nexpired.\") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache\nmember of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but\nthe refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced.\n\nThe IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug.\nWhen the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the\nsk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the\nexception dst.",

The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().\n2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an\n   interrupt.\n3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an\n   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has\n   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag\n   remains set.\n4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call\n   of req-\u003ecomplete(), as shown in the call trace above.\n5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)\n   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the\n   request before invoking the callback.\n6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware\n   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains\n   set.\n\nFor this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at\nsome point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet\ngadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the\ntask context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are\nre-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The\ngadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but\nthe first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,\ntriggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet\narrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from\nreceiving any further packets from the USB host.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This\nparticular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:\n\n1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to\n   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was\n   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.\n   Similar \"bugs\" could be hidden in other drivers as well.\n2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback\n   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),\n   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled\n   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow\n   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an\n   inelegant hack.\n3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request\n   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes\n   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is\n   not ready to process them.\n4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().\n   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at\n   least one request in the queue.

However, in certain cases,\na raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this\nissue is available in [0].\n\nThus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments\ncan actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never\nNULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such\npointers potentially crashing the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special\ncase the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow\npassing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp\nprograms only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id \u003e 0, as in\nthat case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment.\n\nThe reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will\nrecheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then\nconsider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the\nPTR_MAYBE_NULL flag.\n\nTo allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads\ninto trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL.\n\nWhile trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs\nwhere such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will\ntackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can\nalready be passed into helpers and causes similar problems.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: Fix soft lockups in fib6_select_path under high next hop churn\n\nSoft lockups have been observed on a cluster of Linux-based edge routers\nlocated in a highly dynamic environment. Using the `bird` service, these\nrouters continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequently\nchanging nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6\ntraffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipath\ncircular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularly\nwhile iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typically\narises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deleted\nconcurrently on a different core-indicated by their 'next' and\n'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their reference\ncount dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to a\nsoft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer.\n\nApply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve the\nissue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings to\nannotate or use the RCU APIs.\n\nInclude a test script that reproduces the issue. The script\nperiodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy load\nof outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients. It\nconsistently induces infinite soft lockups within a couple of minutes.\n\nKernel log:\n\n 0 [ffffbd13003e8d30] machine_kexec at ffffffff8ceaf3eb\n 1 [ffffbd13003e8d90] __crash_kexec at ffffffff8d0120e3\n 2 [ffffbd13003e8e58] panic at ffffffff8cef65d4\n 3 [ffffbd13003e8ed8] watchdog_timer_fn at ffffffff8d05cb03\n 4 [ffffbd13003e8f08] __hrtimer_run_queues at ffffffff8cfec62f\n 5 [ffffbd13003e8f70] hrtimer_interrupt at ffffffff8cfed756\n 6 [ffffbd13003e8fd0] __sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8cea01af\n 7 [ffffbd13003e8ff0] sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8df1b83d\n-- \u003cIRQ stack\u003e --\n 8 [ffffbd13003d3708] asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt at ffffffff8e000ecb\n    [exception RIP: fib6_select_path+299]\n    RIP: ffffffff8ddafe7b  RSP: ffffbd13003d37b8  RFLAGS: 00000287\n    RAX: ffff975850b43600  RBX: ffff975850b40200  RCX: 0000000000000000\n    RDX: 000000003fffffff  RSI: 0000000051d383e4  RDI: ffff975850b43618\n    RBP: ffffbd13003d3800   R8: 0000000000000000   R9: ffff975850b40200\n    R10: 0000000000000000  R11: 0000000000000000  R12: ffffbd13003d3830\n    R13: ffff975850b436a8  R14: ffff975850b43600  R15: 0000000000000007\n    ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018\n 9 [ffffbd13003d3808] ip6_pol_route at ffffffff8ddb030c\n10 [ffffbd13003d3888] ip6_pol_route_input at ffffffff8ddb068c\n11 [ffffbd13003d3898] fib6_rule_lookup at ffffffff8ddf02b5\n12 [ffffbd13003d3928] ip6_route_input at ffffffff8ddb0f47\n13 [ffffbd13003d3a18] ip6_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0 at ffffffff8dd950d0\n14 [ffffbd13003d3a30] ip6_list_rcv_finish.constprop.0 at ffffffff8dd96274\n15 [ffffbd13003d3a98] ip6_sublist_rcv at ffffffff8dd96474\n16 [ffffbd13003d3af8] ipv6_list_rcv at ffffffff8dd96615\n17 [ffffbd13003d3b60] __netif_receive_skb_list_core at ffffffff8dc16fec\n18 [ffffbd13003d3be0] netif_receive_skb_list_internal at ffffffff8dc176b3\n19 [ffffbd13003d3c50] napi_gro_receive at ffffffff8dc565b9\n20 [ffffbd13003d3c80] ice_receive_skb at ffffffffc087e4f5 [ice]\n21 [ffffbd13003d3c90] ice_clean_rx_irq at ffffffffc0881b80 [ice]\n22 [ffffbd13003d3d20] ice_napi_poll at ffffffffc088232f [ice]\n23 [ffffbd13003d3d80] __napi_poll at ffffffff8dc18000\n24 [ffffbd13003d3db8] net_rx_action at ffffffff8dc18581\n25 [ffffbd13003d3e40] __do_softirq at ffffffff8df352e9\n26 [ffffbd13003d3eb0] run_ksoftirqd at ffffffff8ceffe47\n27 [ffffbd13003d3ec0] smpboot_thread_fn at ffffffff8cf36a30\n28 [ffffbd13003d3ee8] kthread at ffffffff8cf2b39f\n29 [ffffbd13003d3f28] ret_from_fork at ffffffff8ce5fa64\n30 [ffffbd13003d3f50] ret_from_fork_asm at ffffffff8ce03cbb",

This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",

When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use\n'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created\nor dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics\nof netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.\n'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.\nIf a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent\nabout this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the\nnewly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.\nIf 'qlen' reaches the configured sch-\u003elimit, the enqueue function stops\nworking, even though the tfifo is not full.\n\nReproduce the bug:\nEnsure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root\nqdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine\nas follows:\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms\n\nSend bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3\nclient on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:\n$ tc -s qdisc show dev \u003coif\u003e\n\nStatistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that\nnetem's backlog \u003e limit, netem stopped accepting packets):\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\nStatistics after the fix:\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\ntbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.\nThe interface fully stops transferring packets and \"locks\". In this case,\nthe child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at\nits limit and no more packets are accepted.\n\nThis patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is\nonly decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not\nduring enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus\naccounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As\nin other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in\nnetem and all of its children. As before, sch-\u003elimit remains as the\nmaximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's\nbacklog statistics.",

As get_tagged_addr_ctrl() only returns an error\nvalue when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and\ntagged_addr_ctrl_set() should never observe an error value from\nget_tagged_addr_ctrl(). Add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to both to indicate that\nsuch an error would be unexpected, and error handlnig is not missing in\neither case.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue\n\nIn the expression \"cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count\", both variables are u32\nvalues that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer\nwrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also\ncould potentially wrap.  The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\"\nmultiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on\n64bit systems.\n\nThis patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in\nuverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on\none side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified\nall the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.",

Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)-\u003edqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudp: Deal with race between UDP socket address change and rehash\n\nIf a UDP socket changes its local address while it's receiving\ndatagrams, as a result of connect(), there is a period during which\na lookup operation might fail to find it, after the address is changed\nbut before the secondary hash (port and address) and the four-tuple\nhash (local and remote ports and addresses) are updated.\n\nSecondary hash chains were introduced by commit 30fff9231fad (\"udp:\nbind() optimisation\") and, as a result, a rehash operation became\nneeded to make a bound socket reachable again after a connect().\n\nThis operation was introduced by commit 719f835853a9 (\"udp: add\nrehash on connect()\") which isn't however a complete fix: the\nsocket will be found once the rehashing completes, but not while\nit's pending.\n\nThis is noticeable with a socat(1) server in UDP4-LISTEN mode, and a\nclient sending datagrams to it. After the server receives the first\ndatagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to\nthe address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow.\n\nNow, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to\nsend a (subsequent) datagram while the server's socket changes its\naddress, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed\nlookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as\napparent from the following reproducer:\n\n  LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4))\n  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in\n\n  while :; do\n  \ttaskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc \u0026\n  \tsleep 0.1 || sleep 1\n  \ttaskset -c 2 socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null\n  \twait\n  done\n\nwhere the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write()\n(typically the second or third one of a given iteration):\n\n  2024/11/13 21:28:23 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192): Connection refused\n\nThis issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podman's tests\nchecking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the\ncontainer's network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with\nthe lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device:\n\n  LOCAL_ADDR=\"$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM '.[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == \"global\").local')\"\n\n  while :; do\n  \t./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc \u0026\n  \tsleep 0.2 || sleep 1\n  \tsocat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:${LOCAL_ADDR}:1337,shut-null\n  \twait\n  \tcmp tmp.in tmp.out\n  done\n\nOnce this fails:\n\n  tmp.in tmp.out differ: char 8193, line 29\n\nwe can finally have a look at what's going on:\n\n  $ tshark -r pasta.pcap\n      1   0.000000           :: ? ff02::16     ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2\n      2   0.168690 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      3   0.168767 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      4   0.168806 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      5   0.168827 c6:47:05:8d:dc:04 ?

That seems like the simplest way to fix this, so I've\nimplemented his suggestion, using __register_chrdev() with pps_idr\nbecoming the source of truth for which minor corresponds to which\ndevice.\n\nBut now that pps_idr defines userspace visibility instead of cdev_add(),\nwe need to be sure the pps-\u003edev refcount can't reach zero while\nuserspace can still find it again. So, the idr_remove() call moves to\npps_unregister_cdev(), and pps_idr now holds a reference to pps-\u003edev.\n\n    pps_core: source serial1 got cdev (251:1)\n    \u003c...\u003e\n    pps pps1: removed\n    pps_core: unregistering pps1\n    pps_core: deallocating pps1",

At this point qlen is 1, and all of the SFQ slots are empty,\n  however q-\u003etail is not NULL.\n\nAt this point, assuming no more packets are queued, when sch_dequeue\nruns again it will decrement the qlen for the current empty slot\ncausing an underflow and the subsequent out of bounds access.",

GSP calculates the number of pages to write from the\ntotal size of a GSP message. This behavior can be observed from the\nmovement of the write pointer.\n\nHowever, nvkm takes only the size of RPC header and message body as\nthe message size when advancing the read pointer. When handling a\ntwo-page GSP message in the non rollback case, It wrongly takes the\nmessage body of the previous message as the message header of the next\nmessage. As the \"message length\" tends to be zero, in the calculation of\nsize needs to be copied (0 - size of (message header)), the size needs to\nbe copied will be \"0xffffffxx\". It also triggers a kernel panic due to a\nNULL pointer error.\n\n[  547.614102] msg: 00000f90: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 40 d7 18 fb 8b 00 00 00  ........@.......\n[  547.622533] msg: 00000fa0: 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00  ................\n[  547.630965] msg: 00000fb0: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff  ................\n[  547.639397] msg: 00000fc0: ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\n[  547.647832] nvkm 0000:c1:00.0: gsp: peek msg rpc fn:0 len:0x0/0xffffffffffffffe0\n[  547.655225] nvkm 0000:c1:00.0: gsp: get msg rpc fn:0 len:0x0/0xffffffffffffffe0\n[  547.662532] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020\n[  547.669485] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[  547.674624] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[  547.679755] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[  547.682294] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n[  547.686643] CPU: 22 PID: 322 Comm: kworker/22:1 Tainted: G            E      6.9.0-rc6+ #1\n[  547.694893] Hardware name: ASRockRack 1U1G-MILAN/N/ROMED8-NL, BIOS L3.12E 09/06/2022\n[  547.702626] Workqueue: events r535_gsp_msgq_work [nvkm]\n[  547.707921] RIP: 0010:r535_gsp_msg_recv+0x87/0x230 [nvkm]\n[  547.713375] Code: 00 8b 70 08 48 89 e1 31 d2 4c 89 f7 e8 12 f5 ff ff 48 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 cf 00 00 00 48 81 fd 00 f0 ff ff 0f 87 c4 00 00 00 \u003c8b\u003e 55 10 41 8b 46 30 85 d2 0f 85 f6 00 00 00 83 f8 04 76 10 ba 05\n[  547.732119] RSP: 0018:ffffabe440f87e10 EFLAGS: 00010203\n[  547.737335] RAX: 0000000000000010 RBX: 0000000000000008 RCX: 000000000000003f\n[  547.744461] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffabe4480a8030 RDI: 0000000000000010\n[  547.751585] RBP: 0000000000000010 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffabe440f87bb0\n[  547.758707] R10: ffffabe440f87dc8 R11: 0000000000000010 R12: 0000000000000000\n[  547.765834] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffff9351df1e5000 R15: 0000000000000000\n[  547.772958] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff93708eb00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  547.781035] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  547.786771] CR2: 0000000000000020 CR3: 00000003cc220002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n[  547.793896] PKRU: 55555554\n[  547.796600] Call Trace:\n[  547.799046]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  547.801152]  ? __die+0x20/0x70\n[  547.804211]  ? page_fault_oops+0x75/0x170\n[  547.808221]  ? print_hex_dump+0x100/0x160\n[  547.812226]  ? exc_page_fault+0x64/0x150\n[  547.816152]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n[  547.820341]  ? r535_gsp_msg_recv+0x87/0x230 [nvkm]\n[  547.825184]  r535_gsp_msgq_work+0x42/0x50 [nvkm]\n[  547.829845]  process_one_work+0x196/0x3d0\n[  547.833861]  worker_thread+0x2fc/0x410\n[  547.837613]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n[  547.841885]  kthread+0xdf/0x110\n[  547.845031]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n[  547.848775]  ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n[  547.852354]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n[  547.856097]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n[  547.860019]  \u003c/TASK\u003e\n[  547.862208] Modules linked in: nvkm(E) gsp_log(E) snd_seq_dummy(E) snd_hrtimer(E) snd_seq(E) snd_timer(E) snd_seq_device(E) snd(E) soundcore(E) rfkill(E) qrtr(E) vfat(E) fat(E) ipmi_ssif(E) amd_atl(E) intel_rapl_msr(E) intel_rapl_common(E) amd64_edac(E) mlx5_ib(E) edac_mce_amd(E) kvm_amd\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: convert workqueues to unbound\n\nWhen a workqueue is created with `WQ_UNBOUND`, its work items are\nserved by special worker-pools, whose host workers are not bound to\nany specific CPU. In the default configuration (i.e. when\n`queue_delayed_work` and friends do not specify which CPU to run the\nwork item on), `WQ_UNBOUND` allows the work item to be executed on any\nCPU in the same node of the CPU it was enqueued on. While this\nsolution potentially sacrifices locality, it avoids contention with\nother processes that might dominate the CPU time of the processor the\nwork item was scheduled on.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical problem: in a particular scenario\nmisconfigured process was hogging most of the time from CPU0, leaving\nless than 0.5% of its CPU time to the kworker. The IDPF workqueues\nthat were using the kworker on CPU0 suffered large completion delays\nas a result, causing performance degradation, timeouts and eventual\nsystem crash.\n\n\n* I have also run a manual test to gauge the performance\n  improvement. The test consists of an antagonist process\n  (`./stress --cpu 2`) consuming as much of CPU 0 as possible. This\n  process is run under `taskset 01` to bind it to CPU0, and its\n  priority is changed with `chrt -pQ 9900 10000 ${pid}` and\n  `renice -n -20 ${pid}` after start.\n\n  Then, the IDPF driver is forced to prefer CPU0 by editing all calls\n  to `queue_delayed_work`, `mod_delayed_work`, etc... to use CPU 0.\n\n  Finally, `ktraces` for the workqueue events are collected.\n\n  Without the current patch, the antagonist process can force\n  arbitrary delays between `workqueue_queue_work` and\n  `workqueue_execute_start`, that in my tests were as high as\n  `30ms`. With the current patch applied, the workqueue can be\n  migrated to another unloaded CPU in the same node, and, keeping\n  everything else equal, the maximum delay I could see was `6us`.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registers\n\nThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an -\u003eactive() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -\u003eactive() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The -\u003eactive() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the -\u003eget() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are\nset at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be\nsomething to find in the XSAVE buffer.\n\n[ dhansen: changelog/subject tweaks ]",

The only user-visible effect\nof this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow\nstays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function\n\nThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()\nand cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -\u003e\nlist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these\nfunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead\nto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the\nsubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a\nmodification.\n\nIn the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP\nfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list\nhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and\nturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the\nlist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this\noccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and\na UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,\nprior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it\nwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's\nsynchronize_rcu.\n\nThe thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins\nlist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just\nthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.\n\nFortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()\nfunction to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single\nREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.\n\nThis was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning\nsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",

It sets carrier ON\non start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.\nAnd it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.\nTherefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit\nthe infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There\nmight be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is\nimportant for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a\npacket sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the\nissue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.\n\nFix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running\nstate is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers\nunregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets\nto devices that are not running anyway.\n\nWhile only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier\ncheck is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined\nthroughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions\nlike __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit\na packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.",

As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an\ninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.\n\n[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000c0\n[  466.318928] Mem abort info:\n[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  466.341900] Data abort info:\n[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000\n[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000\n[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seq snd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4 snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidev rpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_be btbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_cipher snd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mul snd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2 snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_sched snd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_pio drm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1 raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uio i2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fuse dm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: G         C         6.13.0-v8+ #18\n[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP\n[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)\n[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d]\n[  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228\n[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0\n[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24: ffffff8003bdc200\n[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21: 0000000000000000\n[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15: 0000000000000000\n[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000\n[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : ffffffd08c527eb0\n[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 : ffffffc080003f70\n[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.567263] Call trace:\n[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)\n[  466.\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug\n\nIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the\ncurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used\nthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,\nit is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.\n\nIf the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,\nwe run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx\nare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. \nacomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use\ncrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the\ncrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was\nretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the\nCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the\ncrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.\n\nUse the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating\nand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure\nthat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the\ncompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after\nacquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new\nCPU.\n\nThe initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug\ncallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is\nallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU\nhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by\ncompression/decompression.\n\nPreviously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This\nwould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already\nholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a\ndeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but\nJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug\nnotifiers [2].\n\nAlternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:\n- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in\n  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in\n  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the\n  CPU is onlined.\n- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but\n  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could\n  result in subtle performance issues.\n\n[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n\n[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]",

Some of the used metric sources require\nlocks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU\nlist iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work\naround of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then\nrun this in a new context.\n\nEven when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major\nproblems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed\nanymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or\nthe batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory\naccesses.\n\nDirectly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:\n\n* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with\n  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use\n  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that\n  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker\n  to finish.\n* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is\n  currently done using the RCU specific methods.

The original problems\nare solved by:\n\n* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside\n  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list\n  outside the RCU protected context\n* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock\n  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code\n  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)",

However, it will make the concurrent\noverwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when\nthe map is full.\n\nTherefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling\nof bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:\n1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value\n2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to\n   cancel it again\nConsidering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try\nto acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is\nrunning, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has\ndownside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is\ndelayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable\n(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in\nlocked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if\nnecessary.\n\nIt is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the\nproblem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the\nsoftirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced\nin v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra\ndepends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.\n\nDepends-on: v6.12+ with PREEMPT_RT enabled",

This skb is not\nleaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by\nskb_attempt_defer_free.\n\nThe problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's\ndefer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In\nthat case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't\nexpect at this point.\n\nWe already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no\nlonger needed, so let's also drop the secpath.

But that flag is meant\nto be used for vmalloc() and vmalloc() allocated memory is not\nsupposed to be used before a call to __vmalloc_node_range() which is\nnever called for that area.\n\nThat went undetected until commit e4137f08816b (\"mm, kasan, kmsan:\ninstrument copy_from/to_kernel_nofault\")\n\nThe area allocated by text_area_cpu_up() is not vmalloc memory, it is\nmapped directly on demand when needed by map_kernel_page(). There is\nno VM flag corresponding to such usage, so just pass no flag. That way\nthe area will be unpoisonned and usable immediately.",

Then, the operation on the same pfn is performed\nin uprobe_write_opcode()-\u003e__replace_page() to unconditional decrease the\nRSS count and old_folio's refcount.\n\nTherefore, two bugs are introduced:\n\n 1. The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report\n    error \"Bad rss-count\".\n\n 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio-\u003erefcount is zero,\n    then free_pages_prepare-\u003efree_page_is_bad() report error\n    \"Bad page state\".\n\nThere is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:\n\n  __replace_page()\n    -\u003e ...\n      -\u003e folio_remove_rmap_pte()\n        -\u003e VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)\n\nConsidering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just\nreject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().\n\n[ mingo: Cleaned up the changelog ]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Order the PMU list to fix warning about unordered pmu_ctx_list\n\nSyskaller triggers a warning due to prev_epc-\u003epmu != next_epc-\u003epmu in\nperf_event_swap_task_ctx_data(). vmcore shows that two lists have the same\nperf_event_pmu_context, but not in the same order.\n\nThe problem is that the order of pmu_ctx_list for the parent is impacted by\nthe time when an event/PMU is added. While the order for a child is\nimpacted by the event order in the pinned_groups and flexible_groups. So\nthe order of pmu_ctx_list in the parent and child may be different.\n\nTo fix this problem, insert the perf_event_pmu_context to its proper place\nafter iteration of the pmu_ctx_list.\n\nThe follow testcase can trigger above warning:\n\n # perf record -e cycles --call-graph lbr -- taskset -c 3 ./a.out \u0026\n # perf stat -e cpu-clock,cs -p xxx // xxx is the pid of a.out\n\n test.c\n\n void main() {\n        int count = 0;\n        pid_t pid;\n\n        printf(\"%d running\\n\", getpid());\n        sleep(30);\n        printf(\"running\\n\");\n\n        pid = fork();\n        if (pid == -1) {\n                printf(\"fork error\\n\");\n                return;\n        }\n        if (pid == 0) {\n                while (1) {\n                        count++;\n                }\n        } else {\n                while (1) {\n                        count++;\n                }\n        }\n }\n\nThe testcase first opens an LBR event, so it will allocate task_ctx_data,\nand then open tracepoint and software events, so the parent context will\nhave 3 different perf_event_pmu_contexts. On inheritance, child ctx will\ninsert the perf_event_pmu_context in another order and the warning will\ntrigger.\n\n[ mingo: Tidied up the changelog. ]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: regulatory: improve invalid hints checking\n\nSyzbot keeps reporting an issue [1] that occurs when erroneous symbols\nsent from userspace get through into user_alpha2[] via\nregulatory_hint_user() call. Such invalid regulatory hints should be\nrejected.\n\nWhile a sanity check from commit 47caf685a685 (\"cfg80211: regulatory:\nreject invalid hints\") looks to be enough to deter these very cases,\nthere is a way to get around it due to 2 reasons.\n\n1) The way isalpha() works, symbols other than latin lower and\nupper letters may be used to determine a country/domain.\nFor instance, greek letters will also be considered upper/lower\nletters and for such characters isalpha() will return true as well.\nHowever, ISO-3166-1 alpha2 codes should only hold latin\ncharacters.\n\n2) While processing a user regulatory request, between\nreg_process_hint_user() and regulatory_hint_user() there happens to\nbe a call to queue_regulatory_request() which modifies letters in\nrequest-\u003ealpha2[] with toupper(). This works fine for latin symbols,\nless so for weird letter characters from the second part of _ctype[].\n\nSyzbot triggers a warning in is_user_regdom_saved() by first sending\nover an unexpected non-latin letter that gets malformed by toupper()\ninto a character that ends up failing isalpha() check.\n\nPrevent this by enhancing is_an_alpha2() to ensure that incoming\nsymbols are latin letters and nothing else.\n\n[1] Syzbot report:\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nUnexpected user alpha2: A�\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 964 at net/wireless/reg.c:442 is_user_regdom_saved net/wireless/reg.c:440 [inline]\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 964 at net/wireless/reg.c:442 restore_alpha2 net/wireless/reg.c:3424 [inline]\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 964 at net/wireless/reg.c:442 restore_regulatory_settings+0x3c0/0x1e50 net/wireless/reg.c:3516\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 964 Comm: kworker/1:2 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-syzkaller-00044-gc1e939a21eb1 #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\nWorkqueue: events_power_efficient crda_timeout_work\nRIP: 0010:is_user_regdom_saved net/wireless/reg.c:440 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:restore_alpha2 net/wireless/reg.c:3424 [inline]\nRIP: 0010:restore_regulatory_settings+0x3c0/0x1e50 net/wireless/reg.c:3516\n...\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n crda_timeout_work+0x27/0x50 net/wireless/reg.c:542\n process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3229 [inline]\n process_scheduled_works+0xa65/0x1850 kernel/workqueue.c:3310\n worker_thread+0x870/0xd30 kernel/workqueue.c:3391\n kthread+0x2f2/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n ret_from_fork+0x4d/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n \u003c/TASK\u003e",

If driver_override_show() reads\ncdx_dev-\u003edriver_override without locking, it could potentially access\na freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string\nconcurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address, which is a\nsecurity risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.\n\nAdditionally, a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c, as well\nas many other bus drivers, where device_lock() is taken in the show\nfunction, and it has been working without issues.\n\nThis potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis\ntool, which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify\ndata races and atomicity violations.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlock\n\nThere are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled\nasynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits\nsynchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during\nthe PM shutdown() callback.\n\nIf the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the\ndevice using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the\ndevice_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock\nhas already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while\nwaiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller\nwhich waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to\ndeadlock.\n\nThis is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died\nbefore shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()\ncallback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.\n\nAnd this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during\nthe PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the\ndevice_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if the\nrecovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is also\nobserved on the X1E80100 CRD.\n\nSo to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This\nfunction first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before\ntrying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it\nand reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,\nrecovery_work will fail with the error message \"Recovery failed\" as not\nmuch could be done.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Bridge, fix the crash caused by LAG state check\n\nWhen removing LAG device from bridge, NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event is\ntriggered. Driver finds the lower devices (PFs) to flush all the\noffloaded entries. And mlx5_lag_is_shared_fdb is checked, it returns\nfalse if one of PF is unloaded. In such case,\nmlx5_esw_bridge_lag_rep_get() and its caller return NULL, instead of\nthe alive PF, and the flush is skipped.\n\nBesides, the bridge fdb entry's lastuse is updated in mlx5 bridge\nevent handler. But this SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE event can be\nignored in this case because the upper interface for bond is deleted,\nand the entry will never be aged because lastuse is never updated.\n\nTo make things worse, as the entry is alive, mlx5 bridge workqueue\nkeeps sending that event, which is then handled by kernel bridge\nnotifier. It causes the following crash when accessing the passed bond\nnetdev which is already destroyed.\n\nTo fix this issue, remove such checks. LAG state is already checked in\ncommit 15f8f168952f (\"net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding\nbond to bridge\"), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes\ninvalid state after initialization.\n\n Oops: stack segment: 0000 [#1] SMP\n CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 23695 Comm: kworker/u40:3 Tainted: G           OE      6.11.0_mlnx #1\n Tainted: [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n Workqueue: mlx5_bridge_wq mlx5_esw_bridge_update_work [mlx5_core]\n RIP: 0010:br_switchdev_event+0x2c/0x110 [bridge]\n Code: 44 00 00 48 8b 02 48 f7 00 00 02 00 00 74 69 41 54 55 53 48 83 ec 08 48 8b a8 08 01 00 00 48 85 ed 74 4a 48 83 fe 02 48 89 d3 \u003c4c\u003e 8b 65 00 74 23 76 49 48 83 fe 05 74 7e 48 83 fe 06 75 2f 0f b7\n RSP: 0018:ffffc900092cfda0 EFLAGS: 00010297\n RAX: ffff888123bfe000 RBX: ffffc900092cfe08 RCX: 00000000ffffffff\n RDX: ffffc900092cfe08 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: ffffffffa0c585f0\n RBP: 6669746f6e690a30 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffff888123ae92c8\n R10: 0000000000000000 R11: fefefefefefefeff R12: ffff888123ae9c60\n R13: 0000000000000001 R14: ffffc900092cfe08 R15: 0000000000000000\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88852c980000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: 00007f15914c8734 CR3: 0000000002830005 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n PKRU: 55555554\n Call Trace:\n  \u003cTASK\u003e\n  ? __die_body+0x1a/0x60\n  ? die+0x38/0x60\n  ? do_trap+0x10b/0x120\n  ? do_error_trap+0x64/0xa0\n  ? exc_stack_segment+0x33/0x50\n  ? asm_exc_stack_segment+0x22/0x30\n  ? br_switchdev_event+0x2c/0x110 [bridge]\n  ? sched_balance_newidle.isra.149+0x248/0x390\n  notifier_call_chain+0x4b/0xa0\n  atomic_notifier_call_chain+0x16/0x20\n  mlx5_esw_bridge_update+0xec/0x170 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5_esw_bridge_update_work+0x19/0x40 [mlx5_core]\n  process_scheduled_works+0x81/0x390\n  worker_thread+0x106/0x250\n  ? bh_worker+0x110/0x110\n  kthread+0xb7/0xe0\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n  \u003c/TASK\u003e",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\n\nThere are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's\nFPSIMD/SVE state, including:\n\n* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent\n  configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to\n  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by\n  Eric Auger:\n\n  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997\n\n* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an\n  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.\n\n* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,\n  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses\n  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR\n  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale\n  value in memory.\n\nAvoid these by eagerly saving and \"flushing\" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME\nstate when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the\nhost's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is\nremoved and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is\nplaced in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'\nshould not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be\nremoved in subsequent patches.\n\nHistorical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous\nassumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:\n\n  8383741ab2e773a9 (\"KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving\")\n\n... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL\nstable trees.",
