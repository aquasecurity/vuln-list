PED-12534\n  When this patchset was first added in 2013 (and rewritten over the years),\n  there was no upstream way to easily provide SLE customers with a way to build\n  container images based on SLE using the host subscription. However, with\n  docker-buildx you can now define secrets for builds (this is not entirely\n  transparent, but we can easily document this new requirement for SLE-16).\n  Users should use\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n  when doing their builds.\n- Now that the only blocker for docker-buildx support was removed for SLE-16,\n  enable docker-buildx for SLE-16 as well. PED-8905\n\n- Don't use the new container-selinux conditional requires on SLE-12, as the\n  RPM version there doesn't support it. Arguably the change itself is a bit\n  suspect but we can fix that later. bsc#1237367\n\n- Add backport for golang.org/x/oauth2 CVE-2025-22868 fix. bsc#1239185\n  + 0006-CVE-2025-22868-vendor-jws-split-token-into-fixed-num.patch\n- Add backport for golang.org/x/crypto CVE-2025-22869 fix. bsc#1239322\n  + 0007-CVE-2025-22869-vendor-ssh-limit-the-size-of-the-inte.patch\n- Refresh patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n\n- Make container-selinux requirement conditional on selinux-policy\n  (bsc#1237367)\n\n- Update to Docker 27.5.1-ce.

Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Add docker-integration-tests-devel subpackage for building and running the\n  upstream Docker integration tests on machines to test that Docker works\n  properly. Users should not install this package.\n- docker-rpmlintrc updated to include allow-list for all of the integration\n  tests package, since it contains a bunch of stuff that wouldn't normally be\n  allowed.\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u0026gt;\n\n- Add %{_sysconfdir}/audit/rules.d to filelist.\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic \u0026quot;docker build\u0026quot; has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. bsc#1230331\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  bsc#1230333\n- Make some minor name macro updates to help with the docker-stable package\n  fork.\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615\u0026gt;\n  bsc#1230294\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n  * 0006-bsc1221916-update-to-patched-buildkit-version-to-fix.patch\n  * 0007-bsc1214855-volume-use-AtomicWriteFile-to-save-volume.patch\n  * cli-0001-docs-include-required-tools-in-source-tree.patch\n\nPackage findutils was updated:\n\n- do not crash when file system loop was encountered [bsc#1231472]- added patches\n  fix https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/findutils.git/commit/?id=e5d6eb919b9\n  + findutils-avoid-crash-system-loop.patch\n- modified patches\n  % findutils-xautofs.patch (p1)\n\nPackage glibc was updated:\n\n- static-setuid-ld-library-path.patch: elf: Ignore LD_LIBRARY_PATH and  debug env var for setuid for static (CVE-2025-4802, bsc#1243317)\n\n- pthread-wakeup.patch: pthreads NPTL: lost wakeup fix 2 (bsc#1234128, BZ\n  [#25847])\n\n- assert-message-allocation.patch: Fix underallocation of abort_msg_s\n  struct (CVE-2025-0395, bsc#1236282, BZ #32582))\n\n- tcache-thread-shutdown.patch: malloc: Initiate tcache shutdown even\n  without allocations (bsc#1228661, BZ #28028)\n\nPackage google-guest-agent was updated:\n\n- Update to version 20250506.01 (bsc#1243254, bsc#1243505)  * Make sure agent added connections are activated by NM (#534)\n- from version 20250506.00\n  * wrap NSS cache refresh in a goroutine (#533)\n- from version 20250502.01\n  * Wicked: Only reload interfaces for which configurations are written or changed.

For example when migrating a system\n  from one release to the next where the same repo alias might just\n  have a different URL.\n- Let Service define and update gpgkey, mirrorlist and metalink.\n- Preserve a mirrorlist file in the raw cache during refresh.\n- version 17.37.1 (35)\n\n- Code16: Enable curl2 backend and parallel package download by\n  default.

Accordingly the CMake option\n  ENABLE_PREVIEW_SINGLE_RPMTRANS_AS_DEFAULT_FOR_ZYPPER was removed.\n- version 17.37.0 (35)\n\n- fixed build with boost 1.88.\n- XmlReader: Fix detection of bad input streams (fixes #635)\n  libxml2 2.14 potentially reads the complete stream, so it may\n  have the 'eof' bit set. Which is not 'good' but also not 'bad'.\n- rpm: Fix detection of %triggerscript starts (bsc#1222044)\n- RepoindexFileReader: add more \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt; related attributes a\n  service may set.\n  Add optional attributes gpgcheck, repo_gpgcheck, pkg_gpgcheck,\n  keeppackages, gpgkey, mirrorlist, and metalink with the same\n  semantic as in a .repo file.\n- version 17.36.7 (35)\n\n- Drop workaround for broken rpm-4.18 in Code16 (bsc#1237172)\n- BuildRequires:  %{libsolv_devel_package} \u0026gt;= 0.7.32.\n  Code16 moved static libs to libsolv-devel-static.\n- Drop usage of SHA1 hash algorithm because it will become\n  unavailable in FIPS mode (bsc#1240529)\n- Fix zypp.conf dupAllowVendorChange to reflect the correct\n  default (false).\n  The default was true in Code12 (libzypp-16.x) and changed to\n  false with Code15 (libzypp-17.x). Unfortunately this was done by\n  shipping a modified zypp.conf file rather than fixing the code.\n- zypp.conf: Add `lock_timeout` ($ZYPP_LOCK_TIMEOUT) (bsc#1239809)\n- version 17.36.6 (35)\n\n- Fix computation of RepStatus if Repo URLs change.\n- Fix lost double slash when appending to an absolute FTP url\n  (bsc#1238315)\n  Ftp actually differs between absolute and relative URL paths.\n  Absolute path names begin with a double slash encoded as '/%2F'.\n  This must be preserved when manipulating the path.\n- version 17.36.5 (35)\n\n- Add a transaction package preloader (fixes openSUSE/zypper#104)\n  This patch adds a preloader that concurrently downloads files\n  during a transaction commit. It's not yet enabled per default.\n  To enable the preview set ZYPP_CURL2=1 and ZYPP_PCK_PRELOAD=1\n  in the environment.\n- RpmPkgSigCheck_test: Exchange the test package signingkey\n  (fixes #622)\n- Exclude MediaCurl tests if DISABLE_MEDIABACKEND_TESTS (fixes #626)\n- Strip a mediahandler tag from baseUrl querystrings.\n- version 17.36.4 (35)\n\n- Disable zypp.conf:download.use_deltarpm by default (fixes #620)\n  Measurements show that you don't benefit from using deltarpms\n  unless your network connection is very slow. That's why most\n  distributions even stop offering deltarpms. The default remains\n  unchanged on SUSE-15.6 and older.\n- Make sure repo variables are evaluated in the right context\n  (bsc#1237044)\n- Introducing MediaCurl2 a alternative HTTP backend.\n  This patch adds MediaCurl2 as a testbed for experimenting with a\n  more simple way to download files. Set ZYPP_CURL2=1 in the\n  environment to use it.\n- version 17.36.3 (35)\n\n- Filesystem usrmerge must not be done in singletrans mode\n  (bsc#1236481, bsc#1189788)\n  Commit will amend the backend in case the transaction would\n  perform a filesystem usrmerge.\n- Workaround bsc#1216091 on Code16.\n- version 17.36.2 (35)\n\n- Don't issue deprecated warnings if -DNDEBUG is set (bsc#1236983)\n  Released libyui packages compile with -Werror=deprecated-declarations\n  so we can't add deprecated warnings without breaking them.\n- make gcc15 happy (fixes #613)\n- version 17.36.1 (35)\n\n- Drop zypp-CheckAccessDeleted in favor of 'zypper ps'.\n- Fix Repoverification plugin not being executed (fixes #614)\n- Refresh: Fetch the master index file before key and signature\n  (bsc#1236820)\n- Allow libzypp to compile with C++20.\n- Deprecate RepoReports we do not trigger.\n- version 17.36.0 (35)\n\n- Create '.keep_packages' in the package cache dir to enforce\n  keeping downloaded packages of all repos cahed there (bsc#1232458)\n- version 17.35.19 (35)\n\n- Fix missing UID checks in repomanager workflow (fixes #603)\n- version 17.35.18 (35)\n\n- Move cmake config files to LIB_INSTALL_DIR/cmake/Zypp (fixes #28)\n- Fix 'zypper ps' when running in incus container (bsc#1229106)\n  Should apply to lxc and lxd containers as well.\n- Re-enable 'rpm --runposttrans' usage for chrooted systems\n  (bsc#1216091)\n- version 17.35.17 (35)\n\n- Url: queryparams without value should not have a trailing \u0026quot;=\u0026quot;.\n- version 17.35.16 (35)\n\n- Url query part: `=` is a safe char in value (bsc#1234304)\n- RpmDb: Recognize rpmdb.sqlite as database file (#593)\n- Fix typo (fixes #592)\n- cmake: check location of fcgi header and adjust include\n  accordingly. On Debian and derivatives the fcgi headers\n  are not stored in a fastcgi/ subdirectory.(#590)\n- version 17.35.15 (35)\n\n- The 20MB download limit must not apply to non-metadata files like\n  package URLs provided via the CLI (bsc#1233393).\n- version 17.35.14 (35)\n\n- BuildCache: Don't try to retrieve missing raw metadata if no\n  permission to write the cache (bsc#1225451)\n- RepoManager: throw RepoNoPermissionException if the user has no\n  permission to update(write) the caches (bsc#1225451)\n- version 17.35.13 (35)\n\n- PluginFrame: Send unescaped colons in header values\n  (bsc#1231043)\n  According to the STOMP protocol it would be correct to escape a\n  colon in a header-value, but it breaks plugin receivers which do\n  not expect this. The first colon separates header-name from\n  header-value, so escaping in the header-value is not needed\n  anyway.\n  Escaping in the header-value affects especially the urlresolver\n  plugins. The input URL is passed in a header, but sent back as\n  raw data in the frames body. If the plugin receiver does not\n  correctly unescape the URL we may get back a \u0026quot;https\\c//\u0026quot; which is\n  not usable.\n- Do not ignore return value of std::remove_if in MediaSyncFacade\n  (fixes #579)\n- Fix hang in curl code with no network connection (bsc#1230912)\n- version 17.35.12 (35)\n\n- Deprecate librpmDb::db_const_iterator default ctor (bsc#1230267)\n  It's preferred to explicitly tell the root directory of the\n  system whose database you want to query.\n- version 17.35.11 (35)\n\n- API refactoring.

17.37.0.- Use libzypp improvements for preload and mirror handling.\n- xmlout.rnc: Update repo-element (bsc#1241463)\n  Add the \u0026quot;metalink\u0026quot; attribute and reflect that the \u0026quot;url\u0026quot; elements\n  list may in fact be empty, if no baseurls are defined in the\n  .repo files.\n- man: update --allow-unsigned-rpm description.\n  Explain how to achieve the same for packages provided by\n  repositories.\n- version 1.14.90\n\n- Updated translations (bsc#1230267)\n- version 1.14.89\n\n- Do not double encode URL strings passed on the commandline\n  (bsc#1237587)\n  URLs passed on the commandline must have their special chars\n  encoded already. We just want to check and encode forgotten\n  unsafe chars like a blank. A '%' however must not be encoded\n  again.\n- version 1.14.88\n\n- Package preloader that concurrently downloads files. It's not yet\n  enabled per default. To enable the preview set ZYPP_CURL2=1 and\n  ZYPP_PCK_PRELOAD=1 in the environment. (#104)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.36.4.\n- version 1.14.87\n\n- refresh: add --include-all-archs (fixes #598)\n  Future multi-arch repos may allow to download only those metadata\n  which refer to packages actually compatible with the systems\n  architecture. Some tools however want zypp to provide the full\n  metadata of a repository without filtering incompatible\n  architectures.\n- info,search: add option to search and list Enhances\n  (bsc#1237949)\n- version 1.14.86\n\n- Annonunce --root in commands not launching a Target\n  (bsc#1237044)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.36.3.\n- version 1.14.85\n\n- Let zypper dup fail in case of (temporarily) unaccessible repos\n  (bsc#1228434, bsc#1236939, fixes #446)\n- version 1.14.84\n\n- New system-architecture command (bsc#1236384)\n  Prints the detected system architecture.\n- version 1.14.83\n\n- requires: libzypp \u0026gt;= 17.36.0.\n- Change versioncmp command to return exit code according to the\n  comparison result (#593)\n- version 1.14.82\n\n- lr: show the repositories keep-packages flag (bsc#1232458)\n  It is shown in the  details view or by using -k,--keep-packages.\n  In addition libyzpp supports to enforce keeping downloaded\n  packages of all repos within a package cache by creating a\n  '.keep_packages' file there.\n- version 1.14.81\n\n- Try to refresh update repos first to have updated GPG keys on\n  the fly (bsc#1234752)\n  An update repo may contain a prolonged GPG key for the GA repo.\n  Refreshing the update repo first updates a trusted key on the fly\n  and avoids a 'key has expired' warning being issued when\n  refreshing the GA repo.\n- Refresh: restore legacy behavior and suppress Exception\n  reporting as non-root (bsc#1235636)\n- version 1.14.80\n\n- info: Allow to query a specific version (jsc#PED-11268)\n  To query for a specific version simply append \u0026quot;-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;\u0026quot; or\n  \u0026quot;-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;release\u0026gt;\u0026quot; to the \u0026quot;\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;\u0026quot; pattern. Note that the\n  edition part must always match exactly.\n- version 1.14.79\n\n- Don't try to download missing raw metadata if cache is not\n  writable (bsc#1225451)\n- man: Update 'search' command description.\n  Hint to \u0026quot;se -v\u0026quot; showing the matches within the packages metadata.\n  Explain that search strings starting with a \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; will implicitly\n  look into the filelist as well. Otherfise an explicit \u0026quot;-f\u0026quot; is\n  needed.\n- version 1.14.78\n\n- API refactoring. Prevent zypper from using now private libzypp\n  symbols (bsc#1230267)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.35.10.\n- Fix wrong numbers used in CommitSummary skipped/failed messages.\n- version 1.14.77\n\n",

Most notably, the TDP MMU doesn't zap invalid\nroots in mmu_notifier callbacks.  This leads to use-after-free and other\nissues if the mmu_notifier runs to completion while an invalid root\nzapper yields as KVM fails to honor the requirement that there must be\n_no_ references to the page after the mmu_notifier returns.\n\nThe bug is most easily reproduced by hacking KVM to cause a collision\nbetween set_nx_huge_pages() and kvm_mmu_notifier_release(), but the bug\nexists between kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start() and memslot\nupdates as well.  Invalidating a root ensures pages aren't accessible by\nthe guest, and KVM won't read or write page data itself, but KVM will\ntrigger e.g. kvm_set_pfn_dirty() when zapping SPTEs, and thus completing\na zap of an invalid root _after_ the mmu_notifier returns is fatal.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 24 PID: 1496 at arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:173 [kvm]\n  RIP: 0010:kvm_is_zone_device_pfn+0x96/0xa0 [kvm]\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   kvm_set_pfn_dirty+0xa8/0xe0 [kvm]\n   __handle_changed_spte+0x2ab/0x5e0 [kvm]\n   __handle_changed_spte+0x2ab/0x5e0 [kvm]\n   __handle_changed_spte+0x2ab/0x5e0 [kvm]\n   zap_gfn_range+0x1f3/0x310 [kvm]\n   kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_invalidated_roots+0x50/0x90 [kvm]\n   kvm_mmu_zap_all_fast+0x177/0x1a0 [kvm]\n   set_nx_huge_pages+0xb4/0x190 [kvm]\n   param_attr_store+0x70/0x100\n   module_attr_store+0x19/0x30\n   kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x119/0x1b0\n   new_sync_write+0x11c/0x1b0\n   vfs_write+0x1cc/0x270\n   ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0\n   do_syscall_64+0x38/0xc0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e",

This results in kfree-ing queues that are still\nlinked in napi, which ultimately crashes:\n\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n    #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n    #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n    PGD 0 P4D 0\n    Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n    CPU: 1 PID: 52 Comm: xenwatch Tainted: G        W         5.16.10-1.32.fc32.qubes.x86_64+ #226\n    RIP: 0010:free_netdev+0xa3/0x1a0\n    Code: ff 48 89 df e8 2e e9 00 00 48 8b 43 50 48 8b 08 48 8d b8 a0 fe ff ff 48 8d a9 a0 fe ff ff 49 39 c4 75 26 eb 47 e8 ed c1 66 ff \u003c48\u003e 8b 85 60 01 00 00 48 8d 95 60 01 00 00 48 89 ef 48 2d 60 01 00\n    RSP: 0000:ffffc90000bcfd00 EFLAGS: 00010286\n    RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88800edad000 RCX: 0000000000000000\n    RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffc90000bcfc30 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n    RBP: fffffffffffffea0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\n    R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffff88800edad050\n    R13: ffff8880065f8f88 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff8880066c6680\n    FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880f3300000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n    CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n    CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 00000000e998c006 CR4: 00000000003706e0\n    Call Trace:\n     \u003cTASK\u003e\n     xennet_remove+0x13d/0x300 [xen_netfront]\n     xenbus_dev_remove+0x6d/0xf0\n     __device_release_driver+0x17a/0x240\n     device_release_driver+0x24/0x30\n     bus_remove_device+0xd8/0x140\n     device_del+0x18b/0x410\n     ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x16/0x30\n     ? klist_iter_exit+0x14/0x20\n     ? xenbus_dev_request_and_reply+0x80/0x80\n     device_unregister+0x13/0x60\n     xenbus_dev_changed+0x18e/0x1f0\n     xenwatch_thread+0xc0/0x1a0\n     ? do_wait_intr_irq+0xa0/0xa0\n     kthread+0x16b/0x190\n     ? set_kthread_struct+0x40/0x40\n     ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30\n     \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nFix this by calling xennet_destroy_queues() from xennet_uninit(),\nwhen real_num_tx_queues is still available.

This has been bisected to\ncommit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (\"kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid\nsched_task_group\")\n\nThere  is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)\nwithin a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref  in\nreweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawns\nnumber of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),\nwait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets\ninvoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()\nfor it.\n\nIn the above scenario there is a possibility that\nsetpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread\nin the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for\nwhich the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This will\ntrigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(),  as it will\ntry to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.\n\nBefore the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has been\nset in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),\nbefore the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done in\nthe sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issue\nthe remove the update_load param from the update_load param() function\nand call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have the\nTASK_NEW flag set.",

This results in the VF potentially removing\nits DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.\n\nAdditionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within\nthe ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior\nto the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task\nconcurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in\nsimilar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.\n\nFix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and\nremoval flows using the existing VF cfg_lock. This ensures that we\ncannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a\nvirtchnl message or a reset are occurring.\n\nThis locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit\nc503e63200c6 (\"ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown\"), so we\ncan simply revert it.\n\nNote that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the\noriginal commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race\nconditions.",

If the other thread (for example, from busy_poll) sets\nit to a value \u003e= budget, this thread will continue to run when it should\nstop, and cause memory corruption and panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, save the per-CQ work_done variable in a local variable\nbefore napi_complete_done(), so it won't be corrupted by a possible\nconcurrent thread after napi_complete_done().\n\nAlso, add a flag bit to advertise to the NIC firmware: the NAPI work_done\nvariable race is fixed, so the driver is able to reliably support features\nlike busy_poll.",

As a cgroup interface file can't be\nrenamed, it's safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a\nregular cgroup file.  Also, as these cgroup interface files can't be\nremoved before the directory, it's safe to access the parent too.\n\nPrior to 347c4a874710 (\"memcg: remove cgroup_event-\u003ecft\"), there was a\ncall to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular\ncgroupfs file before further accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from\n__file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped\nthe file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the\ninvarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against\nrenames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.\n\nFix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removed\n\nAfter 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the \"type\" field\nof the event then uses the first type number that is available (not\ncurrently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of the\nbinary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them to\nlogic that can parse the binary blob.\n\nThe issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced and\nis in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it is\ndynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamic\nevent is created that has the same number that new event's logic on\nparsing the binary blob will be used.\n\nTo show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing\n # for i in `seq 65536`; do\n     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' \u003e kprobe_events\n # done\n\nFor every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events will\nremove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) and\nincrease the type number to the next available on until the type number\nreaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After it\nreaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks for\nthe next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that number\nis then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,\nonce the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event in\nthat loop will remain the same.\n\nNow that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reuse\nthe previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.\nAfter the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads the\ndo_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer.\n\n # echo 1 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n # cat /etc/passwd \u003e /dev/null\n # cat trace\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849620: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849838: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849880: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n # echo 0 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n\nNow if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string:\n\n # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' \u003e kprobe_events\n\nAnd now we can the trace:\n\n # cat trace\n        sendmail-1942    [002] .....   530.136320: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930817: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930961: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934278: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934563: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"���������������������������������������\n---truncated---",

PAPR also permits the\nhypervisor to discard this SLB entry (because slb_shadow-\u003epersistent is\nonly set to SLB_NUM_BOLTED) although it's not known whether any\nimplementations would do this (KVM does not). So this is an extremely\nunlikely bug, only found by inspection.\n\nFix this by also storing user r13 in a temporary location on the kernel\nstack and don't change the r13 register from kernel r13 until the RI=0\ncritical section that does not fault.\n\nThe SCRATCH0 change is not strictly part of the fix, it's only used in\nthe RI=0 section so it does not have the same problem as the previous\nSCRATCH0 bug.",

This itself seems a bit sketchy, but the real\nproblem with GCC12 is that it is moving the actual reads/writes around\nat will as though they were independent operations when in truth they\nare not, but the compiler can't know that. When looking at the\nassembly dumps for many of these routines its possible to see very\nclean, but not strictly in program order operations occurring as the\ncompiler would be free to do if these weren't actually register\nreads/write operations.\n\nIts possible to suppress the timeout with a liberal bit of dma_mb()'s\nsprinkled around but the device still seems unable to reliably\nsend/receive data. A better plan is to use the safer readl/writel\neverywhere.\n\nSince this partially reverts an older commit, which notes the use of\nthe relaxed variants for performance reasons. I would suggest that\nany performance problems \n---truncated---",

However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight\nibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is\nprogressing.\n\nSince the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which\ncan then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).\n\nWe cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the -\u003eresetting\nbit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the \"back-end\" of a good\nreset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the -\u003eresetting\nbit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to -\u003eresetting being true,\nthe queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit\ntimeouts.\n\nIOW -\u003eresetting is too broad for this purpose.

All ISA versions\nfrom v2.03 through v3.1 specify that the Data Segment Interrupt sets\nDSISR \"to an undefined value\". As far as I can see there's no mention of\nSLB faults setting DSISR in any BookIV content either.\n\nThis manifests as accesses that should be a read being incorrectly\nreported as writes, for example, using the xmon \"dump\" command:\n\n  0:mon\u003e d 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  5deadbeef0000000\n  [359526.415354][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  [359526.415611][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000010a300\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf400]\n      pc: c00000000010a300: mread+0x90/0x190\n\nIf we disassemble the PC, we see a load instruction:\n\n  0:mon\u003e di c00000000010a300\n  c00000000010a300 89490000      lbz     r10,0(r9)\n\nWe can also see in exceptions-64s.S that the data_access_slb block\ndoesn't set IDSISR=1, which means it doesn't load DSISR into pt_regs. So\nthe value we're using to determine if the fault is a read/write is some\nstale value in pt_regs from a previous page fault.\n\nRework the printing logic to separate the SLB fault case out, and only\nprint read/write in the cases where we can determine it.\n\nThe result looks like eg:\n\n  0:mon\u003e d 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  5deadbeef0000000\n  [  721.779525][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access at 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  [  721.779697][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000014cbe0\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf390]\n\n  0:mon\u003e d 0\n  0000000000000000\n  [  742.793242][    C6] BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0x00000000\n  [  742.793316][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000014cbe0\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf390]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix UAF due to race between btf_try_get_module and load_module\n\nWhile working on code to populate kfunc BTF ID sets for module BTF from\nits initcall, I noticed that by the time the initcall is invoked, the\nmodule BTF can already be seen by userspace (and the BPF verifier). The\nexisting btf_try_get_module calls try_module_get which only fails if\nmod-\u003estate == MODULE_STATE_GOING, i.e. it can increment module reference\nwhen module initcall is happening in parallel.\n\nCurrently, BTF parsing happens from MODULE_STATE_COMING notifier\ncallback. At this point, the module initcalls have not been invoked.\nThe notifier callback parses and prepares the module BTF, allocates an\nID, which publishes it to userspace, and then adds it to the btf_modules\nlist allowing the kernel to invoke btf_try_get_module for the BTF.\n\nHowever, at this point, the module has not been fully initialized (i.e.\nits initcalls have not finished). The code in module.c can still fail\nand free the module, without caring for other users. However, nothing\nstops btf_try_get_module from succeeding between the state transition\nfrom MODULE_STATE_COMING to MODULE_STATE_LIVE.\n\nThis leads to a use-after-free issue when BPF program loads\nsuccessfully in the state transition, load_module's do_init_module call\nfails and frees the module, and BPF program fd on close calls module_put\nfor the freed module. Future patch has test case to verify we don't\nregress in this area in future.\n\nThere are multiple points after prepare_coming_module (in load_module)\nwhere failure can occur and module loading can return error. We\nillustrate and test for the race using the last point where it can\npractically occur (in module __init function).\n\nAn illustration of the race:\n\nCPU 0                           CPU 1\n\t\t\t  load_module\n\t\t\t    notifier_call(MODULE_STATE_COMING)\n\t\t\t      btf_parse_module\n\t\t\t      btf_alloc_id\t// Published to userspace\n\t\t\t      list_add(\u0026btf_mod-\u003elist, btf_modules)\n\t\t\t    mod-\u003einit(...)\n...\t\t\t\t^\nbpf_check\t\t        |\ncheck_pseudo_btf_id             |\n  btf_try_get_module            |\n    returns true                |  ...\n...                             |  module __init in progress\nreturn prog_fd                  |  ...\n...                             V\n\t\t\t    if (ret \u003c 0)\n\t\t\t      free_module(mod)\n\t\t\t    ...\nclose(prog_fd)\n ...\n bpf_prog_free_deferred\n  module_put(used_btf.mod) // use-after-free\n\nWe fix this issue by setting a flag BTF_MODULE_F_LIVE, from the notifier\ncallback when MODULE_STATE_LIVE state is reached for the module, so that\nwe return NULL from btf_try_get_module for modules that are not fully\nformed. Since try_module_get already checks that module is not in\nMODULE_STATE_GOING state, and that is the only transition a live module\ncan make before being removed from btf_modules list, this is enough to\nclose the race and prevent the bug.\n\nA later selftest patch crafts the race condition artifically to verify\nthat it has been fixed, and that verifier fails to load program (with\nENXIO).\n\nLastly, a couple of comments:\n\n 1. Even if this race didn't exist, it seems more appropriate to only\n    access resources (ksyms and kfuncs) of a fully formed module which\n    has been initialized completely.\n\n 2. This patch was born out of need for synchronization against module\n    initcall for the next patch, so it is needed for correctness even\n    without the aforementioned race condition. The BTF resources\n    initialized by module initcall are set up once and then only looked\n    up, so just waiting until the initcall has finished ensures correct\n    behavior.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: Force single empty string when argv is empty\n\nQuoting[1] Ariadne Conill:\n\n\"In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the\nsecond argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting\na scenario where argc \u003c 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,\nbut it is not an explicit requirement[2]:\n\n    The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is\n    associated with the process being started by one of the exec\n    functions.\n...\nInterestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],\nbut there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.\nHopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]\nof this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.\n\nThis issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5].\"\n\nWhile the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be\nmostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL\n(or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]\nexisting userspace programs.\n\nThe next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and\nadjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0\nseems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.\n\nAccount for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an\nempty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so\nuserspace has some notice about the change:\n\n    process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added\n\nAdditionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220127000724.15106-1-ariadne@dereferenced.org/\n[2] https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/exec.html\n[3] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408\n[4] https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt\n[5] https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/176\n[6] https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=execve%5C+*%5C%28%5B%5E%2C%5D%2B%2C+*NULL\u0026literal=0\n[7] https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=execlp%3F%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5E%2C%5D%2B%2C%5Cs*NULL\u0026literal=0\n[8] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220131144352.GE16385@xsang-OptiPlex-9020/",

In this conversion, tpm2_del_space() was missed.  This\ndidn't matter much because it's usually called closely after a\nconverted operation, so there's only a very tiny race window where the\nchip can be removed before the space flushing is done which causes a\nNULL deref on the mutex.  However, there are reports of this window\nbeing hit in practice, so fix this by converting tpm2_del_space() to\nuse tpm_try_get_ops(), which performs all the teardown checks before\nacquring the mutex.",

Although we\napply the restrictions to input parameters, it's based only on the\nhw_params of the underlying PCM device.  Since the PCM OSS layer\nallocates a temporary buffer for the data conversion, the size may\nbecome unexpectedly large when more channels or higher rates is given;\nin the reported case, it went over INT_MAX, hence it hits WARN_ON().\n\nThis patch is an attempt to avoid such an overflow and an allocation\nfor too large buffers.  First off, it adds the limit of 1MB as the\nupper bound for period bytes.  This must be large enough for all use\ncases, and we really don't want to handle a larger temporary buffer\nthan this size.  The size check is performed at two places, where the\noriginal period bytes is calculated and where the plugin buffer size\nis calculated.\n\nIn addition, the driver uses array_size() and array3_size() for\nmultiplications to catch overflows for the converted period size and\nbuffer bytes.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbcache: avoid journal no-space deadlock by reserving 1 journal bucket\n\nThe journal no-space deadlock was reported time to time. Such deadlock\ncan happen in the following situation.\n\nWhen all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy\nwrite I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load\nall active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is\ncalled journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree\nnode and results btree node split, new journal request might be\ntriggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node\nsplit, then the root node record in cache device super block will be\nupgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no\nspace in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal\nbucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This\nis one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens.\n\nThe solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in\nrun time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during\ncache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then\nthe journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for\njournal no-space deadlock to happen anymore.\n\nThis patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is\ninititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to\n1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in\nrun_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to\nallocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check\nwhether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only\n1 free journal bucket and journal-\u003edo_reserve is 1 (true), the last\nbucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate\nno free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try\nnext time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By\nthis method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time.\n\nDuring the cache set registration, journal-\u003edo_reserve is 0 (false), so\nthe reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.",

For USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN, if this function fails because of\nlock is still in used, next time when unlink invokes this function, it\nwill return succeed, and then unlink will remove inode and dentry if lock\nis not in used(file closed), but the dlm lock is still linked in dlm lock\nresource, then when bast come in, it will trigger a panic due to\nuser-after-free.  See the following panic call trace.  To fix this,\nUSER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN should be reverted if fail.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field s_state\n\nThe EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi-\u003es_mount_state is used to indicate that\nwe are in the middle of replay the fast commit journal.  This was\nactually a mistake, since the sbi-\u003es_mount_info is initialized from\nes-\u003es_state.  Arguably s_mount_state is misleadingly named, but the\nname is historical --- s_mount_state and s_state dates back to ext2.\n\nWhat should have been used is the ext4_{set,clear,test}_mount_flag()\ninline functions, which sets EXT4_MF_* bits in sbi-\u003es_mount_flags.\n\nThe problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted\nsuperblock could result in EXT4_FC_REPLAY getting set in\ns_mount_state.  This bypasses some sanity checks, and this can trigger\na BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter\nout the EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit for now.  We should eventually transition\naway from EXT4_FC_REPLAY to something like EXT4_MF_REPLAY.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iolatency: Fix inflight count imbalances and IO hangs on offline\n\niolatency needs to track the number of inflight IOs per cgroup. As this\ntracking can be expensive, it is disabled when no cgroup has iolatency\nconfigured for the device. To ensure that the inflight counters stay\nbalanced, iolatency_set_limit() freezes the request_queue while manipulating\nthe enabled counter, which ensures that no IO is in flight and thus all\ncounters are zero.\n\nUnfortunately, iolatency_set_limit() isn't the only place where the enabled\ncounter is manipulated. iolatency_pd_offline() can also dec the counter and\ntrigger disabling. As this disabling happens without freezing the q, this\ncan easily happen while some IOs are in flight and thus leak the counts.\n\nThis can be easily demonstrated by turning on iolatency on an one empty\ncgroup while IOs are in flight in other cgroups and then removing the\ncgroup. Note that iolatency shouldn't have been enabled elsewhere in the\nsystem to ensure that removing the cgroup disables iolatency for the whole\ndevice.\n\nThe following keeps flipping on and off iolatency on sda:\n\n  echo +io \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control\n  while true; do\n      mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/test\n      echo '8:0 target=100000' \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/test/io.latency\n      sleep 1\n      rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test\n      sleep 1\n  done\n\nand there's concurrent fio generating direct rand reads:\n\n  fio --name test --filename=/dev/sda --direct=1 --rw=randread \\\n      --runtime=600 --time_based --iodepth=256 --numjobs=4 --bs=4k\n\nwhile monitoring with the following drgn script:\n\n  while True:\n    for css in css_for_each_descendant_pre(prog['blkcg_root'].css.address_of_()):\n        for pos in hlist_for_each(container_of(css, 'struct blkcg', 'css').blkg_list):\n            blkg = container_of(pos, 'struct blkcg_gq', 'blkcg_node')\n            pd = blkg.pd[prog['blkcg_policy_iolatency'].plid]\n            if pd.value_() == 0:\n                continue\n            iolat = container_of(pd, 'struct iolatency_grp', 'pd')\n            inflight = iolat.rq_wait.inflight.counter.value_()\n            if inflight:\n                print(f'inflight={inflight} {disk_name(blkg.q.disk).decode(\"utf-8\")} '\n                      f'{cgroup_path(css.cgroup).decode(\"utf-8\")}')\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nThe monitoring output looks like the following:\n\n  inflight=1 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=1 sda /user.slice\n  ...\n  inflight=14 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=13 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=17 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=15 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=18 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=17 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=20 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=19 sda /user.slice \u003c- fio stopped, inflight stuck at 19\n  inflight=19 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=19 sda /user.slice\n\nIf a cgroup with stuck inflight ends up getting throttled, the throttled IOs\nwill never get issued as there's no completion event to wake it up leading\nto an indefinite hang.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug by unifying enable handling into a work item which\nis automatically kicked off from iolatency_set_min_lat_nsec() which is\ncalled from both iolatency_set_limit() and iolatency_pd_offline() paths.\nPunting to a work item is necessary as iolatency_pd_offline() is called\nunder spinlocks while freezing a request_queue requires a sleepable context.\n\nThis also simplifies the code reducing LOC sans the comments and avoids the\nunnecessary freezes which were happening whenever a cgroup's latency target\nis newly set or cleared.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndlm: fix plock invalid read\n\nThis patch fixes an invalid read showed by KASAN. A unlock will allocate a\n\"struct plock_op\" and a followed send_op() will append it to a global\nsend_list data structure. In some cases a followed dev_read() moves it\nto recv_list and dev_write() will cast it to \"struct plock_xop\" and access\nfields which are only available in those structures. At this point an\ninvalid read happens by accessing those fields.\n\nTo fix this issue the \"callback\" field is moved to \"struct plock_op\" to\nindicate that a cast to \"plock_xop\" is allowed and does the additional\n\"plock_xop\" handling if set.\n\nExample of the KASAN output which showed the invalid read:\n\n[ 2064.296453] ==================================================================\n[ 2064.304852] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in dev_write+0x52b/0x5a0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.306491] Read of size 8 at addr ffff88800ef227d8 by task dlm_controld/7484\n[ 2064.308168]\n[ 2064.308575] CPU: 0 PID: 7484 Comm: dlm_controld Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.14.0+ #9\n[ 2064.310292] Hardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 0.5.1 01/01/2011\n[ 2064.311618] Call Trace:\n[ 2064.312218]  dump_stack_lvl+0x56/0x7b\n[ 2064.313150]  print_address_description.constprop.8+0x21/0x150\n[ 2064.314578]  ? dev_write+0x52b/0x5a0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.315610]  ? dev_write+0x52b/0x5a0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.316595]  kasan_report.cold.14+0x7f/0x11b\n[ 2064.317674]  ? dev_write+0x52b/0x5a0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.318687]  dev_write+0x52b/0x5a0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.319629]  ? dev_read+0x4a0/0x4a0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.320713]  ? bpf_lsm_kernfs_init_security+0x10/0x10\n[ 2064.321926]  vfs_write+0x17e/0x930\n[ 2064.322769]  ? __fget_light+0x1aa/0x220\n[ 2064.323753]  ksys_write+0xf1/0x1c0\n[ 2064.324548]  ? __ia32_sys_read+0xb0/0xb0\n[ 2064.325464]  do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x80\n[ 2064.326387]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n[ 2064.327606] RIP: 0033:0x7f807e4ba96f\n[ 2064.328470] Code: 89 54 24 18 48 89 74 24 10 89 7c 24 08 e8 39 87 f8 ff 48 8b 54 24 18 48 8b 74 24 10 41 89 c0 8b 7c 24 08 b8 01 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 31 44 89 c7 48 89 44 24 08 e8 7c 87 f8 ff 48\n[ 2064.332902] RSP: 002b:00007ffd50cfe6e0 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001\n[ 2064.334658] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 000055cc3886eb30 RCX: 00007f807e4ba96f\n[ 2064.336275] RDX: 0000000000000040 RSI: 00007ffd50cfe7e0 RDI: 0000000000000010\n[ 2064.337980] RBP: 00007ffd50cfe7e0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000001\n[ 2064.339560] R10: 000055cc3886eb30 R11: 0000000000000293 R12: 000055cc3886eb80\n[ 2064.341237] R13: 000055cc3886eb00 R14: 000055cc3886f590 R15: 0000000000000001\n[ 2064.342857]\n[ 2064.343226] Allocated by task 12438:\n[ 2064.344057]  kasan_save_stack+0x1c/0x40\n[ 2064.345079]  __kasan_kmalloc+0x84/0xa0\n[ 2064.345933]  kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x13b/0x220\n[ 2064.346953]  dlm_posix_unlock+0xec/0x720 [dlm]\n[ 2064.348811]  do_lock_file_wait.part.32+0xca/0x1d0\n[ 2064.351070]  fcntl_setlk+0x281/0xbc0\n[ 2064.352879]  do_fcntl+0x5e4/0xfe0\n[ 2064.354657]  __x64_sys_fcntl+0x11f/0x170\n[ 2064.356550]  do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x80\n[ 2064.358259]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n[ 2064.360745]\n[ 2064.361511] Last potentially related work creation:\n[ 2064.363957]  kasan_save_stack+0x1c/0x40\n[ 2064.365811]  __kasan_record_aux_stack+0xaf/0xc0\n[ 2064.368100]  call_rcu+0x11b/0xf70\n[ 2064.369785]  dlm_process_incoming_buffer+0x47d/0xfd0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.372404]  receive_from_sock+0x290/0x770 [dlm]\n[ 2064.374607]  process_recv_sockets+0x32/0x40 [dlm]\n[ 2064.377290]  process_one_work+0x9a8/0x16e0\n[ 2064.379357]  worker_thread+0x87/0xbf0\n[ 2064.381188]  kthread+0x3ac/0x490\n[ 2064.383460]  ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30\n[ 2064.385588]\n[ 2064.386518] Second to last potentially related work creation:\n[ 2064.389219]  kasan_save_stack+0x1c/0x40\n[ 2064.391043]  __kasan_record_aux_stack+0xaf/0xc0\n[ 2064.393303]  call_rcu+0x11b/0xf70\n[ 2064.394885]  dlm_process_incoming_buffer+0x47d/0xfd0 [dlm]\n[ 2064.397694]  receive_from_sock+0x290/0x770 \n---truncated---",

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by\nsyz-bot below:\n\n       CPU0              CPU1                    CPU2\n       ----              ----                    ----\n                         lock(console_owner);\n                                                 lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n  lock(\u0026port-\u003elock);\n                         lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n                                                 lock(\u0026port-\u003elock);\n  lock(console_owner);\n\nAs commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to\nload balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by\nusing printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section\nguarded by the port-\u003elock).  But there are too many printk() on the\nkmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing\nprintk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant.\n\nTherefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so\nthat printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be\navoided.\n\nSyzbot reported the following lockdep error:\n\n======================================================\nWARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n5.4.143-00237-g08ccc19a-dirty #10 Not tainted\n------------------------------------------------------\nsyz-executor.4/29420 is trying to acquire lock:\nffffffff8aedb2a0 (console_owner){....}-{0:0}, at: console_trylock_spinning kernel/printk/printk.c:1752 [inline]\nffffffff8aedb2a0 (console_owner){....}-{0:0}, at: vprintk_emit+0x2ca/0x470 kernel/printk/printk.c:2023\n\nbut task is already holding lock:\nffff8880119c9158 (\u0026port-\u003elock){-.-.}-{2:2}, at: pty_write+0xf4/0x1f0 drivers/tty/pty.c:120\n\nwhich lock already depends on the new lock.\n\nthe existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:\n\n-\u003e #2 (\u0026port-\u003elock){-.-.}-{2:2}:\n       __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n       _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x35/0x50 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159\n       tty_port_tty_get drivers/tty/tty_port.c:288 [inline]          \t\t\u003c-- lock(\u0026port-\u003elock);\n       tty_port_default_wakeup+0x1d/0xb0 drivers/tty/tty_port.c:47\n       serial8250_tx_chars+0x530/0xa80 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1767\n       serial8250_handle_irq.part.0+0x31f/0x3d0 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1854\n       serial8250_handle_irq drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1827 [inline] \t\u003c-- lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n       serial8250_default_handle_irq+0xb2/0x220 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1870\n       serial8250_interrupt+0xfd/0x200 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:126\n       __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x109/0xa50 kernel/irq/handle.c:156\n       [...]\n\n-\u003e #1 (\u0026port_lock_key){-.-.}-{2:2}:\n       __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n       _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x35/0x50 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159\n       serial8250_console_write+0x184/0xa40 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:3198\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c-- lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n       call_console_drivers kernel/printk/printk.c:1819 [inline]\n       console_unlock+0x8cb/0xd00 kernel/printk/printk.c:2504\n       vprintk_emit+0x1b5/0x470 kernel/printk/printk.c:2024\t\t\t\u003c-- lock(console_owner);\n       vprintk_func+0x8d/0x250 kernel/printk/printk_safe.c:394\n       printk+0xba/0xed kernel/printk/printk.c:2084\n       register_console+0x8b3/0xc10 kernel/printk/printk.c:2829\n       univ8250_console_init+0x3a/0x46 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:681\n       console_init+0x49d/0x6d3 kernel/printk/printk.c:2915\n       start_kernel+0x5e9/0x879 init/main.c:713\n       secondary_startup_64+0xa4/0xb0 arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S:241\n\n-\u003e #0 (console_owner){....}-{0:0}:\n       [...]\n       lock_acquire+0x127/0x340 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4734\n       console_trylock_spinning kernel/printk/printk.c:1773 \n---truncated---",

When the suspend event occurs between the FW recovery,\nthe restart worker thread is put into frozen state until suspend completes.\nThe suspend event triggers ath10k_stop() which again triggers ath10k_halt()\nThe double invocation of ath10k_halt() causes ath10k_htt_rx_free() to be\ncalled twice(Note: ath10k_htt_rx_alloc was not called by restart worker\nthread because of its frozen state), causing the crash.\n\nTo fix this, during the suspend flow, skip call to ath10k_halt() in\nath10k_stop() when the current driver state is ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.\nAlso, for driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING, call\nath10k_wait_for_suspend() in ath10k_stop().

For example, for the syscall number 0x68000000, which evaluates\nto ESR_ELx.EC value of 0x1A (ESR_ELx_EC_FPAC) the kernel prints this error:\n\n[   18.349161] syscall[300]: unhandled exception: ERET/ERETAA/ERETAB, ESR 0x68000000, Oops - bad compat syscall(2) in syscall[10000+50000]\n[   18.350639] CPU: 2 PID: 300 Comm: syscall Not tainted 5.18.0-rc1 #79\n[   18.351249] Hardware name: Pine64 RockPro64 v2.0 (DT)\n[..]\n\nwhich is misleading, as the bad compat syscall has nothing to do with\npointer authentication.\n\nStop arm64_show_signal() from printing exception syndrome information by\nhaving compat_arm_syscall() set the ESR_ELx value to 0, as it has no\nmeaning for an invalid system call number. The example above now becomes:\n\n[   19.935275] syscall[301]: unhandled exception: Oops - bad compat syscall(2) in syscall[10000+50000]\n[   19.936124] CPU: 1 PID: 301 Comm: syscall Not tainted 5.18.0-rc1-00005-g7e08006d4102 #80\n[   19.936894] Hardware name: Pine64 RockPro64 v2.0 (DT)\n[..]\n\nwhich although shows less information because the syscall number,\nwrongfully advertised as the ESR value, is missing, it is better than\nshowing plainly wrong information. The syscall number can be easily\nobtained with strace.\n\n*A 32-bit value above or equal to 0x8000_0000 is interpreted as a negative\ninteger in compat_arm_syscal() and the condition scno \u003c __ARM_NR_COMPAT_END\nevaluates to true; the syscall will exit to userspace in this case with the\nENOSYS error code instead of arm64_notify_die() being called.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncgroup: Use separate src/dst nodes when preloading css_sets for migration\n\nEach cset (css_set) is pinned by its tasks. When we're moving tasks around\nacross csets for a migration, we need to hold the source and destination\ncsets to ensure that they don't go away while we're moving tasks about. This\nis done by linking cset-\u003emg_preload_node on either the\nmgctx-\u003epreloaded_src_csets or mgctx-\u003epreloaded_dst_csets list. Using the\nsame cset-\u003emg_preload_node for both the src and dst lists was deemed okay as\na cset can't be both the source and destination at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately, this overloading becomes problematic when multiple tasks are\ninvolved in a migration and some of them are identity noop migrations while\nothers are actually moving across cgroups. For example, this can happen with\nthe following sequence on cgroup1:\n\n #1\u003e mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b\n #2\u003e echo $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs\n #3\u003e RUN_A_COMMAND_WHICH_CREATES_MULTIPLE_THREADS \u0026\n #4\u003e PID=$!\n #5\u003e echo $PID \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b/tasks\n #6\u003e echo $PID \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs\n\nthe process including the group leader back into a. In this final migration,\nnon-leader threads would be doing identity migration while the group leader\nis doing an actual one.\n\nAfter #3, let's say the whole process was in cset A, and that after #4, the\nleader moves to cset B. Then, during #6, the following happens:\n\n 1. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on B for the leader.\n\n 2. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on A for the other threads.\n\n 3. cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst() is called. It scans the src list.\n\n 4. It notices that B wants to migrate to A, so it tries to A to the dst\n    list but realizes that its -\u003emg_preload_node is already busy.\n\n 5. and then it notices A wants to migrate to A as it's an identity\n    migration, it culls it by list_del_init()'ing its -\u003emg_preload_node and\n    putting references accordingly.\n\n 6. The rest of migration takes place with B on the src list but nothing on\n    the dst list.\n\nThis means that A isn't held while migration is in progress. If all tasks\nleave A before the migration finishes and the incoming task pins it, the\ncset will be destroyed leading to use-after-free.\n\nThis is caused by overloading cset-\u003emg_preload_node for both src and dst\npreload lists. We wanted to exclude the cset from the src list but ended up\ninadvertently excluding it from the dst list too.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by separating out cset-\u003emg_preload_node into\n-\u003emg_src_preload_node and -\u003emg_dst_preload_node, so that the src and dst\npreloadings don't interfere with each other.",

As a result, this may be leaking DMA memory that's\nbeen used by the driver.\n\nThis commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2\ndriver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It\nexplicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to\nusb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the\ngs_can_open(), we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the\ndisconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.\n\nFor more information, see the 928150fad41b (\"can: esd_usb2: fix memory\nleak\").",

Example RAID layout changes include:\n- raid1 legs being added/removed\n- raid4/5/6/10 number of stripes changed (stripe reshaping)\n- takeover to higher raid level (e.g. raid5 -\u003e raid6)\n\nWhen accessing array members, rs-\u003eraid_disks must be used in control\nloops instead of the potentially larger value in rs-\u003emd.raid_disks.\nOtherwise it will cause memory access beyond the end of the rs-\u003edevs\narray.\n\nFix this by changing code that is prone to out-of-bounds access.\nAlso fix validate_raid_redundancy() to validate all devices that are\nadded. Also, use braces to help clean up raid_iterate_devices().\n\nThe out-of-bounds memory accesses was discovered using KASAN.\n\nThis commit was verified to pass all LVM2 RAID tests (with KASAN\nenabled).",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: ftrace: consistently handle PLTs.\n\nSometimes it is necessary to use a PLT entry to call an ftrace\ntrampoline. This is handled by ftrace_make_call() and ftrace_make_nop(),\nwith each having *almost* identical logic, but this is not handled by\nftrace_modify_call() since its introduction in commit:\n\n  3b23e4991fb66f6d (\"arm64: implement ftrace with regs\")\n\nDue to this, if we ever were to call ftrace_modify_call() for a callsite\nwhich requires a PLT entry for a trampoline, then either:\n\na) If the old addr requires a trampoline, ftrace_modify_call() will use\n   an out-of-range address to generate the 'old' branch instruction.\n   This will result in warnings from aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm() and\n   ftrace_modify_code(), and no instructions will be modified. As\n   ftrace_modify_call() will return an error, this will result in\n   subsequent internal ftrace errors.\n\nb) If the old addr does not require a trampoline, but the new addr does,\n   ftrace_modify_call() will use an out-of-range address to generate the\n   'new' branch instruction. This will result in warnings from\n   aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm(), and ftrace_modify_code() will replace\n   the 'old' branch with a BRK. This will result in a kernel panic when\n   this BRK is later executed.\n\nPractically speaking, case (a) is vastly more likely than case (b), and\ntypically this will result in internal ftrace errors that don't\nnecessarily affect the rest of the system.

However, since p9_fd_open()\ndoes not set O_NONBLOCK flag, but pipe blocks unless signal is pending,\np9_mux_poll_stop() needs to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() when\nthe file descriptor refers to a pipe. In other words, pipe file descriptor\nneeds to be handled as if socket file descriptor.\n\nWe somehow need to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() on pipes.\n\nA minimal change, which this patch is doing, is to set O_NONBLOCK flag\n from p9_fd_open(), for O_NONBLOCK flag does not affect reading/writing\nof regular files. But this approach changes O_NONBLOCK flag on userspace-\nsupplied file descriptors (which might break userspace programs), and\nO_NONBLOCK flag could be changed by userspace. It would be possible to set\nO_NONBLOCK flag every time p9_fd_read()/p9_fd_write() is invoked, but still\nremains small race window for clearing O_NONBLOCK flag.\n\nIf we don't want to manipulate O_NONBLOCK flag, we might be able to\nsurround kernel_read()/kernel_write() with set_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)\nand recalc_sigpending(). Since p9_read_work()/p9_write_work() works are\nprocessed by kernel threads which process global system_wq workqueue,\nsignals could not be delivered from remote threads when p9_mux_poll_stop()\n from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is called. Therefore, calling\nset_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)/recalc_sigpending() every time would be\nneeded if we count on signals for making kernel_read()/kernel_write()\nnon-blocking.\n\n[Dominique: add comment at Christian's suggestion]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: zfcp: Fix double free of FSF request when qdio send fails\n\nWe used to use the wrong type of integer in 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' to cache\nthe FSF request ID when sending a new FSF request. This is used in case the\nsending fails and we need to remove the request from our internal hash\ntable again (so we don't keep an invalid reference and use it when we free\nthe request again).\n\nIn 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' we used to cache the ID as 'int' (signed and 32\nbit wide), but the rest of the zfcp code (and the firmware specification)\nhandles the ID as 'unsigned long'/'u64' (unsigned and 64 bit wide [s390x\nELF ABI]).  For one this has the obvious problem that when the ID grows\npast 32 bit (this can happen reasonably fast) it is truncated to 32 bit\nwhen storing it in the cache variable and so doesn't match the original ID\nanymore.  The second less obvious problem is that even when the original ID\nhas not yet grown past 32 bit, as soon as the 32nd bit is set in the\noriginal ID (0x80000000 = 2'147'483'648) we will have a mismatch when we\ncast it back to 'unsigned long'. As the cached variable is of a signed\ntype, the compiler will choose a sign-extending instruction to load the 32\nbit variable into a 64 bit register (e.g.: 'lgf %r11,188(%r15)'). So once\nwe pass the cached variable into 'zfcp_reqlist_find_rm()' to remove the\nrequest again all the leading zeros will be flipped to ones to extend the\nsign and won't match the original ID anymore (this has been observed in\npractice).\n\nIf we can't successfully remove the request from the hash table again after\n'zfcp_qdio_send()' fails (this happens regularly when zfcp cannot notify\nthe adapter about new work because the adapter is already gone during\ne.g. a ChpID toggle) we will end up with a double free.  We unconditionally\nfree the request in the calling function when 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' fails,\nbut because the request is still in the hash table we end up with a stale\nmemory reference, and once the zfcp adapter is either reset during recovery\nor shutdown we end up freeing the same memory twice.\n\nThe resulting stack traces vary depending on the kernel and have no direct\ncorrelation to the place where the bug occurs. Here are three examples that\nhave been seen in practice:\n\n  list_del corruption. next-\u003eprev should be 00000001b9d13800, but was 00000000dead4ead.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: switchdev: Fix memory leaks when changing VLAN protocol\n\nThe bridge driver can offload VLANs to the underlying hardware either\nvia switchdev or the 8021q driver. When the former is used, the VLAN is\nmarked in the bridge driver with the 'BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV'\nprivate flag.\n\nTo avoid the memory leaks mentioned in the cited commit, the bridge\ndriver will try to delete a VLAN via the 8021q driver if the VLAN is not\nmarked with the previously mentioned flag.\n\nWhen the VLAN protocol of the bridge changes, switchdev drivers are\nnotified via the 'SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_BRIDGE_VLAN_PROTOCOL' attribute, but\nthe 8021q driver is also called to add the existing VLANs with the new\nprotocol and delete them with the old protocol.\n\nIn case the VLANs were offloaded via switchdev, the above behavior is\nboth redundant and buggy. Redundant because the VLANs are already\nprogrammed in hardware and drivers that support VLAN protocol change\n(currently only mlx5) change the protocol upon the switchdev attribute\nnotification. Buggy because the 8021q driver is called despite these\nVLANs being marked with 'BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV'. This leads to\nmemory leaks [1] when the VLANs are deleted.\n\nFix by not calling the 8021q driver for VLANs that were already\nprogrammed via switchdev.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881f6771200 (size 256):\n  comm \"ip\", pid 446855, jiffies 4298238841 (age 55.240s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 00 7f 0e 83 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace:\n    [\u003c00000000012819ac\u003e] vlan_vid_add+0x437/0x750\n    [\u003c00000000f2281fad\u003e] __br_vlan_set_proto+0x289/0x920\n    [\u003c000000000632b56f\u003e] br_changelink+0x3d6/0x13f0\n    [\u003c0000000089d25f04\u003e] __rtnl_newlink+0x8ae/0x14c0\n    [\u003c00000000f6276baf\u003e] rtnl_newlink+0x5f/0x90\n    [\u003c00000000746dc902\u003e] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x336/0xa00\n    [\u003c000000001c2241c0\u003e] netlink_rcv_skb+0x11d/0x340\n    [\u003c0000000010588814\u003e] netlink_unicast+0x438/0x710\n    [\u003c00000000e1a4cd5c\u003e] netlink_sendmsg+0x788/0xc40\n    [\u003c00000000e8992d4e\u003e] sock_sendmsg+0xb0/0xe0\n    [\u003c00000000621b8f91\u003e] ____sys_sendmsg+0x4ff/0x6d0\n    [\u003c000000000ea26996\u003e] ___sys_sendmsg+0x12e/0x1b0\n    [\u003c00000000684f7e25\u003e] __sys_sendmsg+0xab/0x130\n    [\u003c000000004538b104\u003e] do_syscall_64+0x3d/0x90\n    [\u003c0000000091ed9678\u003e] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0",

This has been the case after commit\naa474a220180 (\"nilfs2: add local variable to cache the number of clean\nsegments\"), that is, even before this bug was introduced.\n\nSo, this resolves the deadlock problem by just not taking the semaphore in\nnilfs_count_free_blocks().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: entry: avoid kprobe recursion\n\nThe cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() function is called when\nhandling debug exceptions (and synchronous exceptions from BRK\ninstructions), and so is called when a probed function executes. If the\ncompiler does not inline cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler(), it\ncan be probed.\n\nIf cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() is probed, any debug\nexception or software breakpoint exception will result in recursive\nexceptions leading to a stack overflow. This can be triggered with the\nftrace multiple_probes selftest, and as per the example splat below.\n\nThis is a regression caused by commit:\n\n  6459b8469753e9fe (\"arm64: entry: consolidate Cortex-A76 erratum 1463225 workaround\")\n\n... which removed the NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() annotation associated with the\nfunction.\n\nMy intent was that cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() would be\ninlined into its caller, el1_dbg(), which is marked noinstr and cannot\nbe probed.

It was found from\nvmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content\nsuccessively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a\nuse-after-free occurred.\n\nIn ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the\nFTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled\nops with the same content.  Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace\ncallback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the\nFTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value\nof 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu\nsynchronization.\n\nHowever, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU\nmay be accessing the ops.

A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

Starting in version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.46.0, the grpc Unary Server Interceptor out of the box adds labels `net.peer.sock.addr` and `net.peer.sock.port` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent. An attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for requests. Version 0.46.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can be used. The other possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing `otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider` option with `noop.NewMeterProvider`.",

Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent\n\nThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan\nand Christian Rossow.\n\nACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:\n\n   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if\n   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c=\n   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\n   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\n   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\n   duplicate (SEG.ACK \u003c SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK\n   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK \u003e SND.NXT) then send an\n   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that\n   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means\n   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the\n   ACK check more stringent since any ACK \u003c SND.UNA wouldn't be\n   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -\n   MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c= SND.NXT) get through.\n\nThis can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,\nby not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.\n\nThis greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.\n\nI added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,\neven if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.\n\ntp-\u003ebytes_acked was added in linux-4.2\n\nFollowing packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows\nthe issue at hand:\n\n0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3\n+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0\n+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0\n+0 listen(3, 1024) = 0\n\n// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //\n\n// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to\n// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.

The steps for\nthis are the following:\n\n1) Quotas are enabled;\n\n2) Task A calls the quota rescan ioctl and enters btrfs_qgroup_rescan().\n   It calls qgroup_rescan_init() which returns 0 (success) and then joins a\n   transaction and commits it;\n\n3) Task B calls the quota disable ioctl and enters btrfs_quota_disable().\n   It clears the bit BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED from fs_info-\u003eflags and calls\n   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which returns immediately since the\n   rescan worker is not yet running.\n   Then it starts a transaction and locks fs_info-\u003eqgroup_ioctl_lock;\n\n4) Task A queues the rescan worker, by calling btrfs_queue_work();\n\n5) The rescan worker starts, and calls rescan_should_stop() at the start\n   of its while loop, which results in 0 iterations of the loop, since\n   the flag BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED was cleared from fs_info-\u003eflags by\n   task B at step 3);\n\n6) Task B sets fs_info-\u003equota_root to NULL;\n\n7) The rescan worker tries to start a transaction and uses\n   fs_info-\u003equota_root as the root argument for btrfs_start_transaction().\n   This results in a NULL pointer dereference down the call chain of\n   btrfs_start_transaction(). The stack trace is something like the one\n   reported in Link tag below:\n\n   general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000041: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\n   KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000208-0x000000000000020f]\n   CPU: 1 PID: 34 Comm: kworker/u4:2 Not tainted 6.1.0-syzkaller-13872-gb6bb9676f216 #0\n   Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 10/26/2022\n   Workqueue: btrfs-qgroup-rescan btrfs_work_helper\n   RIP: 0010:start_transaction+0x48/0x10f0 fs/btrfs/transaction.c:564\n   Code: 48 89 fb 48 (...)\n   RSP: 0018:ffffc90000ab7ab0 EFLAGS: 00010206\n   RAX: 0000000000000041 RBX: 0000000000000208 RCX: ffff88801779ba80\n   RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: 0000000000000000\n   RBP: dffffc0000000000 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: fffff52000156f5d\n   R10: fffff52000156f5d R11: 1ffff92000156f5c R12: 0000000000000000\n   R13: 0000000000000001 R14: 0000000000000001 R15: 0000000000000003\n   FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b9900000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n   CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n   CR2: 00007f2bea75b718 CR3: 000000001d0cc000 CR4: 00000000003506e0\n   DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n   DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n   Call Trace:\n    \u003cTASK\u003e\n    btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker+0x3bb/0x6a0 fs/btrfs/qgroup.c:3402\n    btrfs_work_helper+0x312/0x850 fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:280\n    process_one_work+0x877/0xdb0 kernel/workqueue.c:2289\n    worker_thread+0xb14/0x1330 kernel/workqueue.c:2436\n    kthread+0x266/0x300 kernel/kthread.c:376\n    ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:308\n    \u003c/TASK\u003e\n   Modules linked in:\n\nSo fix this by having the rescan worker function not attempt to start a\ntransaction if it didn't do any rescan work.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSquashfs: fix handling and sanity checking of xattr_ids count\n\nA Sysbot [1] corrupted filesystem exposes two flaws in the handling and\nsanity checking of the xattr_ids count in the filesystem.  Both of these\nflaws cause computation overflow due to incorrect typing.\n\nIn the corrupted filesystem the xattr_ids value is 4294967071, which\nstored in a signed variable becomes the negative number -225.\n\nFlaw 1 (64-bit systems only):\n\nThe signed integer xattr_ids variable causes sign extension.\n\nThis causes variable overflow in the SQUASHFS_XATTR_*(A) macros.  The\nvariable is first multiplied by sizeof(struct squashfs_xattr_id) where the\ntype of the sizeof operator is \"unsigned long\".\n\nOn a 64-bit system this is 64-bits in size, and causes the negative number\nto be sign extended and widened to 64-bits and then become unsigned.  This\nproduces the very large number 18446744073709548016 or 2^64 - 3600.  This\nnumber when rounded up by SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE - 1 (8191 bytes) and\ndivided by SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE overflows and produces a length of 0\n(stored in len).\n\nFlaw 2 (32-bit systems only):\n\nOn a 32-bit system the integer variable is not widened by the unsigned\nlong type of the sizeof operator (32-bits), and the signedness of the\nvariable has no effect due it always being treated as unsigned.\n\nThe above corrupted xattr_ids value of 4294967071, when multiplied\noverflows and produces the number 4294963696 or 2^32 - 3400.  This number\nwhen rounded up by SQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE - 1 (8191 bytes) and divided by\nSQUASHFS_METADATA_SIZE overflows again and produces a length of 0.\n\nThe effect of the 0 length computation:\n\nIn conjunction with the corrupted xattr_ids field, the filesystem also has\na corrupted xattr_table_start value, where it matches the end of\nfilesystem value of 850.\n\nThis causes the following sanity check code to fail because the\nincorrectly computed len of 0 matches the incorrect size of the table\nreported by the superblock (0 bytes).\n\n    len = SQUASHFS_XATTR_BLOCK_BYTES(*xattr_ids);\n    indexes = SQUASHFS_XATTR_BLOCKS(*xattr_ids);\n\n    /*\n     * The computed size of the index table (len bytes) should exactly\n     * match the table start and end points\n    */\n    start = table_start + sizeof(*id_table);\n    end = msblk-\u003ebytes_used;\n\n    if (len != (end - start))\n            return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);\n\nChanging the xattr_ids variable to be \"usigned int\" fixes the flaw on a\n64-bit system.  This relies on the fact the computation is widened by the\nunsigned long type of the sizeof operator.\n\nCasting the variable to u64 in the above macro fixes this flaw on a 32-bit\nsystem.\n\nIt also means 64-bit systems do not implicitly rely on the type of the\nsizeof operator to widen the computation.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/000000000000cd44f005f1a0f17f@google.com/",

The subsystem allows multiple\nuser space listeners to the region, while data of the payload was likely\nreleased before the listeners execute read(2) to access to it for copying\nto user space.\n\nThe issue was fixed by a commit 281e20323ab7 (\"firewire: core: fix\nuse-after-free regression in FCP handler\"). The object of payload is\nduplicated in kernel space for each listener. When the listener executes\nioctl(2) with FW_CDEV_IOC_SEND_RESPONSE request, the object is going to\nbe released.\n\nHowever, it causes memory leak since the commit relies on call of\nrelease_request() in drivers/firewire/core-cdev.c. Against the\nexpectation, the function is never called due to the design of\nrelease_client_resource(). The function delegates release task\nto caller when called with non-NULL fourth argument. The implementation\nof ioctl_send_response() is the case. It should release the object\nexplicitly.\n\nThis commit fixes the bug.",

In this case, the second write\nmay be subject to speculative store bypass (SSB) creating a\nspeculative pointer-as-scalar type confusion. This allows the\nprogram to subsequently leak the numerical pointer value using,\nfor example, a branch-based cache side channel.\n\nTo fix this, also sanitize scalars if they write a stack slot\nthat previously contained a pointer. Assuming that pointer-spills\nare only generated by LLVM on register-pressure, the performance\nimpact on most real-world BPF programs should be small.\n\nThe following unprivileged BPF bytecode drafts a minimal exploit\nand the mitigation:\n\n  [...]\n  // r6 = 0 or 1 (skalar, unknown user input)\n  // r7 = accessible ptr for side channel\n  // r10 = frame pointer (fp), to be leaked\n  //\n  r9 = r10 # fp alias to encourage ssb\n  *(u64 *)(r9 - 8) = r10 // fp[-8] = ptr, to be leaked\n  // lfence added here because of pointer spill to stack.\n  //\n  // Ommitted: Dummy bpf_ringbuf_output() here to train alias predictor\n  // for no r9-r10 dependency.\n  //\n  *(u64 *)(r10 - 8) = r6 // fp[-8] = scalar, overwrites ptr\n  // 2039f26f3aca: no lfence added because stack slot was not STACK_INVALID,\n  // store may be subject to SSB\n  //\n  // fix: also add an lfence when the slot contained a ptr\n  //\n  r8 = *(u64 *)(r9 - 8)\n  // r8 = architecturally a scalar, speculatively a ptr\n  //\n  // leak ptr using branch-based cache side channel:\n  r8 \u0026= 1 // choose bit to leak\n  if r8 == 0 goto SLOW // no mispredict\n  // architecturally dead code if input r6 is 0,\n  // only executes speculatively iff ptr bit is 1\n  r8 = *(u64 *)(r7 + 0) # encode bit in cache (0: slow, 1: fast)\nSLOW:\n  [...]\n\nAfter running this, the program can time the access to *(r7 + 0) to\ndetermine whether the chosen pointer bit was 0 or 1. Repeat this 64\ntimes to recover the whole address on amd64.\n\nIn summary, sanitization can only be skipped if one scalar is\noverwritten with another scalar. Scalar-confusion due to speculative\nstore bypass can not lead to invalid accesses because the pointer\nbounds deducted during verification are enforced using branchless\nlogic. See 979d63d50c0c (\"bpf: prevent out of bounds speculation on\npointer arithmetic\") for details.\n\nDo not make the mitigation depend on !env-\u003eallow_{uninit_stack,ptr_leaks}\nbecause speculative leaks are likely unexpected if these were enabled.\nFor example, leaking the address to a protected log file may be acceptable\nwhile disabling the mitigation might unintentionally leak the address\ninto the cached-state of a map that is accessible to unprivileged\nprocesses.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/active: Fix misuse of non-idle barriers as fence trackers\n\nUsers reported oopses on list corruptions when using i915 perf with a\nnumber of concurrently running graphics applications.  Root cause analysis\npointed at an issue in barrier processing code -- a race among perf open /\nclose replacing active barriers with perf requests on kernel context and\nconcurrent barrier preallocate / acquire operations performed during user\ncontext first pin / last unpin.\n\nWhen adding a request to a composite tracker, we try to reuse an existing\nfence tracker, already allocated and registered with that composite.  The\ntracker we obtain may already track another fence, may be an idle barrier,\nor an active barrier.\n\nIf the tracker we get occurs a non-idle barrier then we try to delete that\nbarrier from a list of barrier tasks it belongs to.  However, while doing\nthat we don't respect return value from a function that performs the\nbarrier deletion.  Should the deletion ever fail, we would end up reusing\nthe tracker still registered as a barrier task.  Since the same structure\nfield is reused with both fence callback lists and barrier tasks list,\nlist corruptions would likely occur.\n\nBarriers are now deleted from a barrier tasks list by temporarily removing\nthe list content, traversing that content with skip over the node to be\ndeleted, then populating the list back with the modified content.  Should\nthat intentionally racy concurrent deletion attempts be not serialized,\none or more of those may fail because of the list being temporary empty.\n\nRelated code that ignores the results of barrier deletion was initially\nintroduced in v5.4 by commit d8af05ff38ae (\"drm/i915: Allow sharing the\nidle-barrier from other kernel requests\").  However, all users of the\nbarrier deletion routine were apparently serialized at that time, then the\nissue didn't exhibit itself.  Results of git bisect with help of a newly\ndeveloped igt@gem_barrier_race@remote-request IGT test indicate that list\ncorruptions might start to appear after commit 311770173fac (\"drm/i915/gt:\nSchedule request retirement when timeline idles\"), introduced in v5.5.\n\nRespect results of barrier deletion attempts -- mark the barrier as idle\nonly if successfully deleted from the list.  Then, before proceeding with\nsetting our fence as the one currently tracked, make sure that the tracker\nwe've got is not a non-idle barrier.  If that check fails then don't use\nthat tracker but go back and try to acquire a new, usable one.\n\nv3: use unlikely() to document what outcome we expect (Andi),\n  - fix bad grammar in commit description.\nv2: no code changes,\n  - blame commit 311770173fac (\"drm/i915/gt: Schedule request retirement\n    when timeline idles\"), v5.5, not commit d8af05ff38ae (\"drm/i915: Allow\n    sharing the idle-barrier from other kernel requests\"), v5.4,\n  - reword commit description.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 506006055769b10d1b2b4e22f636f3b45e0e9fc7)",

In particular on an SR-IOV device VFs\nmay be removed and later re-added.\n\nIn commit a50297cf8235 (\"s390/pci: separate zbus creation from\nscanning\") it was missed however that struct pci_bus and struct\nzpci_bus's resource list retained a reference to the PCI functions MMIO\nresources even though those resources are released and freed on\nhot-unplug. These stale resources may subsequently be claimed when the\nPCI function re-appears resulting in use-after-free.\n\nOne idea of fixing this use-after-free in s390 specific code that was\ninvestigated was to simply keep resources around from the moment a PCI\nfunction first appeared until the whole virtual PCI bus created for\na multi-function device disappears. The problem with this however is\nthat due to the requirement of artificial MMIO addreesses (address\ncookies) extra logic is then needed to keep the address cookies\ncompatible on re-plug. At the same time the MMIO resources semantically\nbelong to the PCI function so tying their lifecycle to the function\nseems more logical.\n\nInstead a simpler approach is to remove the resources of an individually\nhot-unplugged PCI function from the PCI bus's resource list while\nkeeping the resources of other PCI functions on the PCI bus untouched.\n\nThis is done by introducing pci_bus_remove_resource() to remove an\nindividual resource. Similarly the resource also needs to be removed\nfrom the struct zpci_bus's resource list. It turns out however, that\nthere is really no need to add the MMIO resources to the struct\nzpci_bus's resource list at all and instead we can simply use the\nzpci_bar_struct's resource pointer directly.",

Fix it by\nwaiting for idleness of vma-\u003efence-\u003eactive in i915_vma_revoke_fence().\n\n(cherry picked from commit 24bb052d3dd499c5956abad5f7d8e4fd07da7fb1)",

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

Once that happens a\nWARN_ON(jbd2_handle_buffer_credits(handle) \u003c= 0) is triggered in\njbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() and subsequently OCFS2 aborts in response to\nthis error.

When performing a search and displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S), the search pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689.",

      "Description": "Vim is an improved version of the unix vi text editor. When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0697. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

When the umount operation is executed,\ntop_cpuset.css.cgrp will be rebound to \u0026cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp.\n\nThe problem is that when rebinding to cgrp_dfl_root, there are cases\nwhere the cgroup_root allocated by setting up the root for cgroup v1\nis cached.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage\n\nWhen opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is\ndone against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file\npointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file\nmetadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how\nto set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the\npermissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.\n\nFor example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not\nset-id:\n\n---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nto set-id and non-executable:\n\n---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nit is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been\ndisallowed.\n\nWhile this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been\nobserved (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating\nthe setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being\nworld-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid\nbit. For example, \"chmod o-x,u+s target\" makes \"target\" executable only\nby uid \"root\" and gid \"cdrom\", while also becoming setuid-root:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nbecomes:\n\n-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nBut racing the chmod means users without group \"cdrom\" membership can\nget the permission to execute \"target\" just before the chmod, and when\nthe chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the\nsetuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of \"only cdrom\ngroup members can setuid to root\".\n\nRe-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata\nhas changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,\nbut until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a\nfull inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that\nthis is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",

Then, this new struct is freed and\nthe pointers start leading to nowhere.\n\nBut generally speaking, the current logic is very fragile. It claims\nto be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact, it\nconsumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this\nfunction, there are two vports allocated with their queues and vectors.\nMoreover, it claims to prevent the driver from running into \"bad state\",\nbut in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport in the\npartially allocated state.\nFinally, if the interface is down when the function is called, it always\nallocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the\ninterface later on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there's\na clear memory leak here.\n\nJust don't allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves\ncrashes and memory leaks.

      "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.",

      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

Locking involved\nthere has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the\nreturn from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a\nproblem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of\nwhich touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't\nrelevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already\nbeing held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a\ndeadlock.\n\nThis deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but\nwas analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light\nof the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking\ndiscipline work.\n\nIn staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered\nto be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the\nlocking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note\nthat even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired\nfor any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount\n\nDuring unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:\n\n1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically\n   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);\n\n2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective\n   struct task_struct;\n\n3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all\n   the work queues and then free the work queues.\n\nSyzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing\na delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at\nbtrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread\nwas already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait\nfor any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against\nthe cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.\n\nFix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call\nkthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.\n\nThe stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880272a8a18 by task kworker/u8:3/52\n\n  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 52 Comm: kworker/u8:3 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc1-syzkaller #0\n  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\n  Workqueue: btrfs-fixup btrfs_work_helper\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x241/0x360 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n   print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:377 [inline]\n   print_report+0x169/0x550 mm/kasan/report.c:488\n   kasan_report+0x143/0x180 mm/kasan/report.c:601\n   __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n   lock_acquire+0x1ed/0x550 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5825\n   __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n   _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0xd5/0x120 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:162\n   class_raw_spinlock_irqsave_constructor include/linux/spinlock.h:551 [inline]\n   try_to_wake_up+0xb0/0x1480 kernel/sched/core.c:4154\n   btrfs_writepage_fixup_worker+0xc16/0xdf0 fs/btrfs/inode.c:2842\n   btrfs_work_helper+0x390/0xc50 fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:314\n   process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3229 [inline]\n   process_scheduled_works+0xa63/0x1850 kernel/workqueue.c:3310\n   worker_thread+0x870/0xd30 kernel/workqueue.c:3391\n   kthread+0x2f0/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  Allocated by task 2:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   unpoison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:319 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_alloc+0x66/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:345\n   kasan_slab_alloc include/linux/kasan.h:247 [inline]\n   slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:4086 [inline]\n   slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:4135 [inline]\n   kmem_cache_alloc_node_noprof+0x16b/0x320 mm/slub.c:4187\n   alloc_task_struct_node kernel/fork.c:180 [inline]\n   dup_task_struct+0x57/0x8c0 kernel/fork.c:1107\n   copy_process+0x5d1/0x3d50 kernel/fork.c:2206\n   kernel_clone+0x223/0x880 kernel/fork.c:2787\n   kernel_thread+0x1bc/0x240 kernel/fork.c:2849\n   create_kthread kernel/kthread.c:412 [inline]\n   kthreadd+0x60d/0x810 kernel/kthread.c:765\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n\n  Freed by task 61:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x40/0x50 mm/kasan/generic.c:579\n   poison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:247 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x59/0x70 mm/kasan/common.c:264\n   kasan_slab_free include/linux/kasan.h:230 [inline]\n   slab_free_h\n---truncated---",

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------\u003e+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

There are\nmyriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,\nand others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.\n\nFor guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure\ntracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is\nnecessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing\nis enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).

E.g. configuring\nguest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware\nwill result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,\nwhich generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential\ndeadlock, etc.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/pci: Properly hide first-in-list PCIe extended capability\n\nThere are cases where a PCIe extended capability should be hidden from\nthe user. For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and\nto an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.\n\nFix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater\nthan PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct\nread only access instead of the ecap_perms array.\n\nNote that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can\nexceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which\nare already checked before).\n\n[1]\n\nWARNING: CPU: 118 PID: 5329 at drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1900 vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\nCPU: 118 UID: 0 PID: 5329 Comm: simx-qemu-syste Not tainted 6.12.0+ #1\n(snip)\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n ? __warn+0x8d/0x140\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x244/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_rw+0x101/0x1b0 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_core_read+0x1d/0x30 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_device_fops_read+0x27/0x40 [vfio]\n vfs_read+0xbd/0x340\n ? vfio_device_fops_unl_ioctl+0xbb/0x740 [vfio]\n ? __rseq_handle_notify_resume+0xa4/0x4b0\n __x64_sys_pread64+0x96/0xc0\n x64_sys_call+0x1c3d/0x20d0\n do_syscall_64+0x4d/0x120\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp.

This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",

If the index is \"bad\", the nospec clamping will\ngenerate '0', i.e. KVM will return vCPU0 instead of NULL.\n\nIn practice, the bug is unlikely to cause problems, as it will only come\ninto play if userspace or the guest is buggy or misbehaving, e.g. KVM may\nsend interrupts to vCPU0 instead of dropping them on the floor.\n\nHowever, returning vCPU0 when it shouldn't exist per online_vcpus is\nproblematic now that KVM uses an xarray for the vCPUs array, as KVM needs\nto insert into the xarray before publishing the vCPU to userspace (see\ncommit c5b077549136 (\"KVM: Convert the kvm-\u003evcpus array to a xarray\")),\ni.e. before vCPU creation is guaranteed to succeed.\n\nAs a result, incorrectly providing access to vCPU0 will trigger a\nuse-after-free if vCPU0 is dereferenced and kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu()\nbails out of vCPU creation due to an error and frees vCPU0.  Commit\nafb2acb2e3a3 (\"KVM: Fix vcpu_array[0] races\") papered over that issue, but\nin doing so introduced an unsolvable teardown conundrum.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug\n\nIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the\ncurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used\nthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,\nit is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.\n\nIf the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,\nwe run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx\nare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. \nacomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use\ncrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the\ncrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was\nretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the\nCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the\ncrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.\n\nUse the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating\nand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure\nthat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the\ncompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after\nacquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new\nCPU.\n\nThe initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug\ncallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is\nallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU\nhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by\ncompression/decompression.\n\nPreviously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This\nwould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already\nholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a\ndeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but\nJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug\nnotifiers [2].\n\nAlternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:\n- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in\n  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in\n  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the\n  CPU is onlined.\n- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but\n  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could\n  result in subtle performance issues.\n\n[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n\n[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop\n\nMove the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value\nout of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware\nwith a stale vcpu-\u003earch.dr6.\n\nWhen the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,\nKVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on\nVM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs\nat will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint\nonly generates one VM-Exit.\n\nFor DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also\nidentical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)\nand KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading\nDR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.\n\nBut for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for\nKVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas\nVMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the\nguest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done\n_inside_ the core run loop.\n\nUnfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common\nx86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in\nhardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is\na fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu-\u003earch.dr6 and\nclobber the guest's actual value.\n\nThe bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX\npreemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6\nbeing modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is\norders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the\nVMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection\nand the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the\nwindow where hardware DR6 is \"dirty\" extends all the way from L1 writing\nDR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).\n\n    L1's view:\n    ==========\n    \u003cL1 disables DR interception\u003e\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640961: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n A:  L1 Writes DR6\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640963: \u003chack\u003e: Set DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff1\n\n B:        CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640967: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT intr_info 0x800000ec\n\n D: L1 reads DR6, arch.dr6 = 0\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640969: \u003chack\u003e: Sync DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640976: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n    L2 reads DR6, L1 disables DR interception\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640980: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640983: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640983: \u003chack\u003e: Set DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n    L2 detects failure\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640987: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason HLT\n    L1 reads DR6 (confirms failure)\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640990: \u003chack\u003e: Sync DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n    L0's view:\n    ==========\n    L2 reads DR6, arch.dr6 = 0\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005610: kvm_exit: vcpu 23 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] .....  3410.005610: kvm_nested_vmexit: vcpu 23 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n\n    L2 =\u003e L1 nested VM-Exit\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] .....  3410.005610: kvm_nested_vmexit_inject: reason: DR_ACCESS ext_inf1: 0x0000000000000216\n\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005610: kvm_entry: vcpu 23\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005611: kvm_exit: vcpu 23 reason VMREAD\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005611: kvm_entry: vcpu 23\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.\n---truncated---",

This means\nthat operations must be atomic in order to, e.g., avoid spreading\nwrites across multiple rows. Since the shadow SRAM array is used to\nfind free rows in the hardware table, it must also be protected in\norder to avoid TOCTOU errors where multiple cores allocate the same\nrow.\n\nThis issue was detected in a situation where `mvpp2_set_rx_mode()` ran\nconcurrently on two CPUs. In this particular case the\nMVPP2_PE_MAC_UC_PROMISCUOUS entry was corrupted, causing the\nclassifier unit to drop all incoming unicast - indicated by the\n`rx_classifier_drops` counter.",

It first loads\nthe '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()\nand then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir\nentry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the\nsame data block.\n\nIf the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the\nsanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data\nblock) and leaves \"struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de\" point exactly past the\nmemory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to\next4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer\nwhich results in out-of-bounds mem access.\n\nFix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir\nentries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony\ndir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).\n\nNote: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another\nstructure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is\nreally an OOB read.\n\nThis issue was found by syzkaller tool.\n\nCall Trace:\n[   38.594108] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.594649] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88802b41a004 by task syz-executor/5375\n[   38.595158]\n[   38.595288] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5375 Comm: syz-executor Not tainted 6.14.0-rc7 #1\n[   38.595298] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[   38.595304] Call Trace:\n[   38.595308]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[   38.595311]  dump_stack_lvl+0xa7/0xd0\n[   38.595325]  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x3f0\n[   38.595339]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595349]  print_report+0xaa/0x250\n[   38.595359]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595368]  ? kasan_addr_to_slab+0x9/0x90\n[   38.595378]  kasan_report+0xab/0xe0\n[   38.595389]  ? __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595400]  __ext4_check_dir_entry+0x67e/0x710\n[   38.595410]  ext4_empty_dir+0x465/0x990\n[   38.595421]  ? __pfx_ext4_empty_dir+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595432]  ext4_rmdir.part.0+0x29a/0xd10\n[   38.595441]  ? __dquot_initialize+0x2a7/0xbf0\n[   38.595455]  ? __pfx_ext4_rmdir.part.0+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595464]  ? __pfx___dquot_initialize+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595478]  ? down_write+0xdb/0x140\n[   38.595487]  ? __pfx_down_write+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595497]  ext4_rmdir+0xee/0x140\n[   38.595506]  vfs_rmdir+0x209/0x670\n[   38.595517]  ? lookup_one_qstr_excl+0x3b/0x190\n[   38.595529]  do_rmdir+0x363/0x3c0\n[   38.595537]  ? __pfx_do_rmdir+0x10/0x10\n[   38.595544]  ? strncpy_from_user+0x1ff/0x2e0\n[   38.595561]  __x64_sys_unlinkat+0xf0/0x130\n[   38.595570]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x180\n[   38.595583]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",
