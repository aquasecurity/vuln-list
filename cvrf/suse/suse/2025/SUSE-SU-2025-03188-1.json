In this example the rss lock would be destroyed by the device\nunregistration path before being used again, but in general running\nethnl operations while dismantle has started is not a good idea.\n\nFix this by denying any operation on devices being unregistered. A check\nwas already there in ethnl_ops_begin, but not wide enough.\n\nNote that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version\n(__dev_ethtool) because the device reference is retrieved from within\nthe rtnl lock section there. Once dismantle started, the net device is\nunlisted and no reference will be found.",
