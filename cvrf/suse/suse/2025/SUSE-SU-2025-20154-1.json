      "Text": "This update for python311 fixes the following issues:\n\n- Skip PGO with %want_reproducible_builds (bsc#1239210)\n\n- CVE-2025-0938: Disallows square brackets ([ and ]) in domain names for parsed\n  URLs (bsc#1236705).\n\n- Configure externally_managed with a bcond (bsc#1228165).\n\n- Update to 3.11.11:\n  - Tools/Demos\n    - gh-123418: Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.15\n      and multissltests to use 3.0.15, 3.1.7, and 3.2.3.\n  - Tests\n    - gh-125041: Re-enable skipped tests for zlib on the\n      s390x architecture: only skip checks of the compressed\n      bytes, which can be different between zlib’s software\n      implementation and the hardware-accelerated implementation.\n  - Security\n    - gh-126623: Upgrade libexpat to 2.6.4\n    - gh-122792: Changed IPv4-mapped ipaddress.IPv6Address to\n      consistently use the mapped IPv4 address value for deciding\n      properties. Properties which have their behavior fixed are\n      is_multicast, is_reserved, is_link_local, is_global, and\n      is_unspecified.\n  - Library\n    - gh-124651: Properly quote template strings in venv\n      activation scripts (bsc#1232241, CVE-2024-9287).\n\n- Remove -IVendor/ from python-config (bsc#1231795)\n\n- CVE-2024-9287: Properly quote path names provided when creating a\n  virtual environment (bsc#1232241)\n\n- Drop .pyc files from docdir for reproducible builds\n  (bsc#1230906).\n\n- Update to 3.11.10:\n  - Security\n    - gh-123678: Upgrade libexpat to 2.6.3\n    - gh-121957: Fixed missing audit events around interactive\n      use of Python, now also properly firing for ``python -i``,\n      as well as for ``python -m asyncio``. The event in question\n      is ``cpython.run_stdin``.\n    - gh-122133: Authenticate the socket connection for the\n      ``socket.socketpair()`` fallback on platforms where\n      ``AF_UNIX`` is not available like Windows. Patch by\n      Gregory P. Smith \u003cgreg@krypto.org\u003e and Seth Larson\n      \u003cseth@python.org\u003e. Reported by Ellie \u003cel@horse64.org\u003e\n    - gh-121285: Remove backtracking from tarfile header parsing\n      for ``hdrcharset``, PAX, and GNU sparse headers\n      (bsc#1230227, CVE-2024-6232).\n    - gh-118486: :func:`os.mkdir` on Windows now accepts\n      *mode* of ``0o700`` to restrict the new directory to\n      the current user. This fixes CVE-2024-4030 affecting\n      :func:`tempfile.mkdtemp` in scenarios where the base\n      temporary directory is more permissive than the default.\n    - gh-116741: Update bundled libexpat to 2.6.2\n  - Library\n    - gh-123270: Applied a more surgical fix for malformed\n      payloads in :class:`zipfile.Path` causing infinite loops\n      (gh-122905) without breaking contents using legitimate\n      characters (bsc#1229704, CVE-2024-8088).\n    - gh-123067: Fix quadratic complexity in parsing ``\"``-quoted\n      cookie values with backslashes by :mod:`http.cookies`\n      (bsc#1229596, CVE-2024-7592).\n    - gh-122905: :class:`zipfile.Path` objects now sanitize names\n      from the zipfile.\n    - gh-121650: :mod:`email` headers with embedded newlines are\n      now quoted on output. The :mod:`~email.generator` will now\n      refuse to serialize (write) headers that are unsafely folded\n      or delimited; see :attr:`~email.policy.Policy.verify_generated_headers`.\n      (Contributed by Bas Bloemsaat and Petr Viktorin in\n      :gh:`121650`; CVE-2024-6923, bsc#1228780).\n    - gh-119506: Fix :meth:`!io.TextIOWrapper.write` method\n      breaks internal buffer when the method is called again\n      during flushing internal buffer.\n    - gh-118643: Fix an AttributeError in the :mod:`email` module\n      when re-fold a long address list. Also fix more cases of\n      incorrect encoding of the address separator in the address\n      list.\n    - gh-113171: Fixed various false positives and false\n      negatives in * :attr:`ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private`\n      (see these docs for details) *\n      :attr:`ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global` *\n      :attr:`ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_private` *\n      :attr:`ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_global` Also in the\n      corresponding :class:`ipaddress.IPv4Network` and\n      :class:`ipaddress.IPv6Network` attributes.\n      Fixes bsc#1226448 (CVE-2024-4032).\n    - gh-102988: :func:`email.utils.getaddresses` and\n      :func:`email.utils.parseaddr` now return ``('', '')``\n      2-tuples in more situations where invalid email addresses\n      are encountered instead of potentially inaccurate\n      values. Add optional *strict* parameter to these two\n      functions: use ``strict=False`` to get the old behavior,\n      accept malformed inputs. ``getattr(email.utils,\n      'supports_strict_parsing', False)`` can be use to check if\n      the *strict* paramater is available. Patch by Thomas Dwyer\n      and Victor Stinner to improve the CVE-2023-27043 fix\n      (bsc#1210638).\n    - gh-67693: Fix :func:`urllib.parse.urlunparse` and\n      :func:`urllib.parse.urlunsplit` for URIs with path starting\n      with multiple slashes and no authority. Based on patch by\n      Ashwin Ramaswami.\n  - Core and Builtins\n    - gh-112275: A deadlock involving ``pystate.c``'s\n      ``HEAD_LOCK`` in ``posixmodule.c`` at fork is now\n      fixed. Patch by ChuBoning based on previous Python 3.12 fix\n      by Victor Stinner.\n    - gh-109120: Added handle of incorrect star expressions, e.g\n      ``f(3, *)``.

Not accepting empty bytes as key\n      causes it to hang indefinitely.\n    - bpo-42125: linecache: get module name from __spec__ if\n      available. This allows getting source code for the __main__\n      module when a custom loader is used.\n    - gh-66543: Make mimetypes.guess_type() properly parsing of URLs\n      with only a host name, URLs containing fragment or query, and\n      filenames with only a UNC sharepoint on Windows. Based on patch\n      by Dong-hee Na.\n    - bpo-33775: Add ‘default’ and ‘version’ help text for\n      localization in argparse.\n  * Documentation\n    - gh-115399: Document CVE-2023-52425 of Expat \u003c2.6.0 under “XML\n      vulnerabilities”.\n    - gh-115233: Fix an example for LoggerAdapter in the Logging\n      Cookbook.\n  * Tests\n    - gh-83434: Disable JUnit XML output (--junit-xml=FILE command\n      line option) in regrtest when hunting for reference leaks (-R\n      option). Patch by Victor Stinner.\n    - gh-117187: Fix XML tests for vanilla Expat \u003c2.6.0.\n    - gh-115979: Update test_importlib so that it passes under WASI\n      SDK 21.\n    - gh-116307: Added import helper isolated_modules as CleanImport\n      does not remove modules imported during the context.\n    - gh-115720: Leak tests (-R, --huntrleaks) now show a summary of\n      the number of leaks found in each iteration.\n    - gh-115122: Add --bisect option to regrtest test runner: run\n      failed tests with test.bisect_cmd to identify failing tests.\n      Patch by Victor Stinner.\n    - gh-115596: Fix ProgramPriorityTests in test_os permanently\n      changing the process priority.\n    - gh-115198: Fix test_check_metadata_deprecate in distutils tests\n      with a newer Docutils.\n  * Build\n    - gh-116313: Get WASI builds to work under wasmtime 18 w/ WASI\n      0.2/preview2 primitives.\n    - gh-115167: Avoid vendoring vcruntime140_threads.dll when\n      building with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8.\n  * Windows\n    - gh-116773: Fix instances of \u003c_overlapped.Overlapped object at\n      0xXXX\u003e still has pending operation at deallocation, the process\n      may crash.\n    - gh-91227: Fix the asyncio ProactorEventLoop implementation so\n      that sending a datagram to an address that is not listening does\n      not prevent receiving any more datagrams.\n    - gh-115554: The installer now has more strict rules about\n      updating the Python Launcher for Windows. In general, most users\n      only have a single launcher installed and will see no\n      difference. When multiple launchers have been installed, the\n      option to install the launcher is disabled until all but one\n      have been removed. Downgrading the launcher (which was never\n      allowed) is now more obviously blocked.\n    - gh-115543: Python Launcher for Windows can now detect Python\n      3.13 when installed from the Microsoft Store, and will install\n      Python 3.12 by default when PYLAUNCHER_ALLOW_INSTALL is set.\n    - gh-115009: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.45.1.\n  * IDLE\n    - gh-88516: On macOS show a proxy icon in the title bar of editor\n      windows to match platform behaviour.\n  * Tools/Demos\n    - gh-113516: Don’t set LDSHARED when building for WASI.\n  * C API\n    - gh-117021: Fix integer overflow in PyLong_AsPid() on non-Windows\n      64-bit platforms.\n\n- Add reference to CVE-2024-0450 (bsc#1221854) to changelog.\n",
