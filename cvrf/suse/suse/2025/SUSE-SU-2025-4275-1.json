      "CVE": "CVE-2025-38616",
      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: handle data disappearing from under the TLS ULP\n\nTLS expects that it owns the receive queue of the TCP socket.\nThis cannot be guaranteed in case the reader of the TCP socket\nentered before the TLS ULP was installed, or uses some non-standard\nread API (eg. zerocopy ones). Replace the WARN_ON() and a buggy\nearly exit (which leaves anchor pointing to a freed skb) with real\nerror handling. Wipe the parsing state and tell the reader to retry.\n\nWe already reload the anchor every time we (re)acquire the socket lock,\nso the only condition we need to avoid is an out of bounds read\n(not having enough bytes in the socket for previously parsed record len).\n\nIf some data was read from under TLS but there's enough in the queue\nwe'll reload and decrypt what is most likely not a valid TLS record.\nLeading to some undefined behavior from TLS perspective (corrupting\na stream? missing an alert? missing an attack?) but no kernel crash\nshould take place.",
