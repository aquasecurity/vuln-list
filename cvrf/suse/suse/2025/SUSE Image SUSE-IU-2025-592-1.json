      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp6-chost-byos-v20250212-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update named.root to latest version- Update to release 9.18.33\n  Security Fixes:\n  * DNS-over-HTTPS flooding fixes.\n    Fix DNS-over-HTTPS implementation issues that arise under heavy\n    query load. Optimize resource usage for named instances that\n    accept queries over DNS-over-HTTPS.\n    Previously, named processed all incoming HTTP/2 data at once,\n    which could overwhelm the server, especially when dealing with\n    clients that sent requests but did not wait for responses. That\n    has been fixed. Now, named handles HTTP/2 data in smaller\n    chunks and throttles reading until the remote side reads the\n    response data. It also throttles clients that send too many\n    requests at once.\n    In addition, named now evaluates excessive streams opened by\n    clients that include no DNS data, which is considered\n    âflooding.â It logs these clients and drops connections from\n    them.\n    In some cases, named could leave DNS-over-HTTPS connections in\n    the CLOSE_WAIT state indefinitely. That has also been fixed.\n    (CVE-2024-12705)\n    [bsc#1236597]\n  * Limit additional section processing for large RDATA sets.\n    When answering queries, donât add data to the additional\n    section if the answer has more than 13 names in the RDATA. This\n    limits the number of lookups into the database(s) during a\n    single client query, reducing the query-processing load.\n    (CVE-2024-11187)\n    [bsc#1236596]\n  New Features:\n  * Add a new option to configure the maximum number of outgoing\n    queries per client request.\n  * The configuration option max-query-count sets how many outgoing\n    queries per client request are allowed. The existing\n    max-recursion-queries value is the number of permissible\n    queries for a single name and is reset on every CNAME\n    redirection. This new option is a global limit on the client\n    request. The default is 200.\n  * The default for max-recursion-queries is changed from 32 to 50.\n    This allows named to send a few more queries while looking up a\n    single name.\n  * Print the full path of the working directory in startup log\n    messages.\n    named now prints its initial working directory during startup,\n    and the changed working directory when loading or reloading its\n    configuration file, if it has a valid directory option defined.\n  * Added WALLET type.\n    Add the new record type WALLET (262). This provides a mapping\n    from a domain name to a cryptographic currency wallet. Multiple\n    mappings can exist if multiple records exist.\n  * Update built-in bind.keys file with the new 2025 IANA root key.\n  * Add an initial-ds entry to bind.keys for the new root key, ID\n    38696, which is scheduled for publication in January 2025.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * Tighten max-recursion-queries and add max-query-restarts\n    configuration statement.\n    There were cases when the max-recursion-queries quota was\n    ineffective. It was possible to craft zones that would cause a\n    resolver to waste resources by sending excessive queries while\n    attempting to resolve a name. This has been addressed by\n    correcting errors in the implementation of\n    max-recursion-queries and by reducing the default value from\n    100 to 32.\n    In addition, a new max-query-restarts configuration statement\n    has been added, which limits the number of times a recursive\n    server will follow CNAME or DNAME records before terminating\n    resolution. This was previously a hard-coded limit of 16 but is\n    now configurable with a default value of 11.\n  * Raise the log level of priming failures.\n    When a priming query is complete, it was previously logged at\n    level DEBUG(1), regardless of success or failure. It is now\n    logged to NOTICE in the case of failure.\n  * Add a compatibility shim for older libuv versions (\u0026lt; 1.19.0)\n    The function uv_stream_get_write_queue_size() is supported only\n    in relatively new versions of libuv (1.19.0 or higher). Provide\n    a compatibility shim for this function so BIND 9 can be built\n    in environments with older libuv versions.\n  * Improve performance for queries that require an NSEC3 wildcard\n    proof.\n    Rather than starting from the longest matching part of the\n    requested name, lookup the shortest partial match. Most of the\n    time this will be the actual closest encloser.\n  * Follow the number of CPUs set by taskset/cpuset.\n    Administrators may wish to constrain the set of cores that\n    named runs on via the taskset, cpuset, or numactl programs (or\n    equivalents on other OSes).\n    If the admin has used taskset, named now automatically uses the\n    given number of CPUs rather than the system-wide count.\n  * Allow IXFR-to-AXFR fallback on DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.\n    This change allows fallback from an IXFR failure to AXFR when\n    the reason is DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.\n  * Emit more helpful log messages for exceeding\n    max-records-per-type.\n  * The new log message is emitted when adding or updating an RRset\n    fails due to exceeding the max-records-per-type limit. The log\n    includes the owner name and type, corresponding zone name, and\n    the limit value. It will be emitted on loading a zone file,\n    inbound zone transfer (both AXFR and IXFR), handling a DDNS\n    update, or updating a cache DB. Itâs especially helpful in the\n    case of zone transfer, since the secondary side doesnât have\n    direct access to the offending zone data.\n  * It could also be used for max-types-per-name, but this change\n    doesnât implement it yet as itâs much less likely to happen in\n    practice.\n  * Harden key management when key files have become unavailable.\n  * Prior to doing key management, BIND 9 will check if the key\n    files on disk match the expected keys. If key files for\n    previously observed keys have become unavailable, this will\n    prevent the internal key manager from running.\n  Removed Features:\n  * Move contributed DLZ modules into a separate repository. DLZ\n    modules should not be used except in testing. The DLZ modules\n    were not maintained, the DLZ interface itself is going to be\n    scheduled for removal, and the DLZ interface is blocking. Any\n    module that blocks the query to the database blocks the whole\n    server. The DLZ modules now live in\n    https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/dlz-modules repository.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  For a complete list of bug fixes, see:\n  * Bind Release Notes\n    https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9.18.33/notes.html\n  * The changelog in the doc rpm at\n    /usr/share/doc/packages/bind/arm/html/changelog.html\n\nPackage crypto-policies was updated:\n\n- krb5: disallow aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 and aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96  kerberos encryption types from RFC3961 in FIPS mode, as its key\n  derivation function is not certified; (jsc#PED-12018);\n- Update AD-SUPPORT and add AD-SUPPORT-LEGACY subpolicies; (jsc#PED-12018);\n  The AD-SUPPORT subpolicy will enable the aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96\n  and aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 encryption types necessary for AD.\n  The Kerberos libraries will tell OpenSSL provider to bypass FIPS\n  restrictions when loading the KRB5KDF module.\n  The AD-SUPPORT-LEGACY will allow the use of RC4 encryption types\n  in environments where either accounts or trusted domains objects\n  were not yet migrated to AES.\n- Add patch 0008-policies-modules-update-AD-SUPPORT-add-AD-SUP.patch\n\nPackage google-guest-configs was updated:\n\n- Add ggc-no-dup-metasrv-entry.patch  + Follow up to (bsc#1234289, bsc#1234293).

This can happen with significant\nprobability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular\nthe NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker\nprocess must either be located in the same physical computer or must\nhave a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.",
