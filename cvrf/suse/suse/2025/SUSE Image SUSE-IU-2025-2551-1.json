PED-12534\n  When this patchset was first added in 2013 (and rewritten over the years),\n  there was no upstream way to easily provide SLE customers with a way to build\n  container images based on SLE using the host subscription. However, with\n  docker-buildx you can now define secrets for builds (this is not entirely\n  transparent, but we can easily document this new requirement for SLE-16).\n  Users should use\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n  when doing their builds.\n- Now that the only blocker for docker-buildx support was removed for SLE-16,\n  enable docker-buildx for SLE-16 as well.

the following steps:\n  * The downstream script rpm/modversions unpacks the consolidated kABI\n  symtypes reference data from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symtypes-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt; and creates\n  individual symref files.\n  * The build performs a regular kernel make. During this operation, genksyms\n  is invoked for each source file. The tool determines type signatures of\n  all exports within the file, reports any differences compared to the\n  associated symref reference, calculates symbol CRCs from the signatures\n  and writes new type data into a symtypes file.\n  * The script rpm/modversions is invoked again, this time it packs all new\n  symtypes files to a consolidated kABI file.\n  * The downstream script rpm/kabi.pl checks symbol CRCs in the new build and\n  compares them to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking\n  kabi/severities into account.\n  suse-kabi-tools is a new set of tools to improve the kABI checking process.\n  The suite includes two tools, ksymtypes and ksymvers, which replace the\n  existing scripts rpm/modversions and rpm/kabi.pl, as well as the comparison\n  functionality previously provided by genksyms. The tools have their own\n  source repository and package.\n  The tools provide faster operation and more detailed, unified output. In\n  addition, they allow the use of the new upstream tool gendwarfksyms, which\n  lacks any built-in comparison functionality.\n  The updated workflow is as follows:\n  * The build performs a regular kernel make. During this operation, genksyms\n  (gendwarfksyms) is invoked as usual, determinining signatures and CRCs of\n  all exports and writing the type data to symtypes files. However,\n  genksyms no longer performs any comparison.\n  * 'ksymtypes consolidate' packs all new symtypes files to a consolidated\n  kABI file.\n  * 'ksymvers compare' checks symbol CRCs in the new build and compares them\n  to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking kabi/severities\n  into account. The tool writes its result in a human-readable form on\n  standard output and also writes a list of all changed exports (not\n  ignored by kabi/severities) to the changed-exports file.\n  * 'ksymtypes compare' takes the changed-exports file, the consolidated kABI\n  symtypes reference data from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symtypes-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt; and the new\n  consolidated data. Based on this data, it produces a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols changed.\n  The patch enables the use of suse-kabi-tools via rpm/config.sh, providing\n  explicit control to each branch. To enable the support, set\n  USE_SUSE_KABI_TOOLS=Yes in the config file.\n- commit a2c6f89\n\n- kernel-source: Remove log.sh from sources\n- commit 96bd779\n\n- netfilter: ipset: add missing range check in bitmap_ip_uadt (CVE-2024-53141 bsc#1234381)\n- commit 21ac02b\n\n- net_sched: hfsc: Fix a potential UAF in hfsc_dequeue() too\n  (CVE-2025-37823 bsc#1242924).\n- commit dca98b0\n\n- sch_hfsc: Fix qlen accounting bug when using peek in\n  hfsc_enqueue() (CVE-2025-38000 bsc#1244277).\n- net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem\n  as child qdisc (CVE-2025-37890 bsc#1243330).\n- net: sched: sch_multiq: fix possible OOB write in multiq_tune()\n  (CVE-2024-36978 bsc#1226514).\n- commit 8d2bb29\n\n- netfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash types\n  (CVE-2025-37997 bsc#1243832).\n- commit d102bab\n\n- net: sched: Disallow replacing of child qdisc from one parent\n  to another (CVE-2025-21700 bsc#1237159).\n- commit bde17d3\n\n- netem: Update sch-\u0026gt;q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()\n  (git-fixes CVE-2025-21703 bsc#1237313).\n- commit 982a71f\n\n- pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch-\u0026gt;limit == 0 (CVE-2025-21702 bsc#1237312)\n- commit f34470d\n\n- net_sched: sch_fifo: implement lockless __fifo_dump() (bsc#1237312)\n- commit a87a922\n\n- netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element\n  (CVE-2024-26924 bsc#1223387).\n- commit b465633\n\n- net/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc\n  (CVE-2024-56770 bsc#1235637).\n- sch/netem: fix use after free in netem_dequeue (CVE-2024-56770\n  bsc#1235637 CVE-2024-46800 bsc#1230827).\n- commit 3360a1a\n\n- mkspec: Exclude rt flavor from kernel-syms dependencies (bsc#1244337).\n- commit 7c95ae0\n\n- MyBS: Do not build kernel-obs-qa with limit_packages\n  Fixes: 58e3f8c34b2b (\u0026quot;bs-upload-kernel: Pass limit_packages also on multibuild\u0026quot;)\n- commit f4c6047\n\n- MyBS: Simplify qa_expr generation\n  Start with a 0 which makes the expression valid even if there are no QA\n  repositories (currently does not happen).

So injecting an\n    Obsoletes: product:oldproductname \u0026lt; oldproductversion\n  into the -release package to indicate a product rename is no longer\n  possible.\n  Since libsolv-0.7.34 you can and should use:\n    Provides: product-obsoletes(oldproductname) \u0026lt; oldproductversion\n  in the -release package. libsolv will then inject the appropriate\n  Obsoletes into the Product.\n- version 17.37.10 (35)\n\n- Ignore DeltaRpm download errors (bsc#1245672)\n  DeltaRpms are in fact optional resources.

This patch adds some checks if the response\n  code is in the success range and only then takes expected\n  filesize into account. Otherwise the response content-length is\n  used or a fallback of 2Mb if no content-length is known.\n- version 17.37.8 (35)\n\n- Fix SEGV in MediaDISK handler (bsc#1245452)\n- Explicitly selecting DownloadAsNeeded also selects the\n  classic_rpmtrans backend.\n  DownloadAsNeeded can not be combined with the rpm singletrans\n  installer backend because a rpm transaction requires all package\n  headers to be available the the beginning of the transaction. So\n  explicitly selecting this mode also turns on the classic_rpmtrans\n  backend.\n- Fix evaluation of libproxy results (bsc#1244710)\n- version 17.37.7 (35)\n\n- Enhancements regarding mirror handling during repo refresh.\n  Added  means to disable the use of mirrors when downloading\n  security relevant files. Requires updaing zypper to 1.14.91.\n- Fix autotestcase writer if ZYPP_FULLLOG=1 (bsc#1244042)\n  If ZYPP_FULLLOG=1 a solver testcase to\n  \u0026quot;/var/log/YaST2/autoTestcase\u0026quot; should be written for each solver\n  run. There was no testcase written for the very first solver run.\n  This is now fixed.\n- Pass $1==2 to %posttrans script if it's an update (bsc#1243279)\n- version 17.37.6 (35)\n\nPackage net-tools was updated:\n\n- Drop 0002-Do-not-warn-about-interface-socket-not-binded.patch.

The function\n\"any_pmc_overflown\" checks the PMCs on active events in\ncpuhw-\u003en_events. Code snippet:\n\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\nif (any_pmc_overflown(cpuhw))\n \tclear_pmi_irq_pending();\n else\n \tWARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending());\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\n\nHere the PMC overflown is not from active event. Example: When we do\nperf record, default cycles and instructions will be running on PMC6\nand PMC5 respectively. It could happen that overflowed event is currently\nnot active and pending PMI is for the inactive event. Debug logs from\ntrace_printk:\n\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\nany_pmc_overflown: idx is 5: pmc value is 0xd9a\npower_pmu_disable: PMC1: 0x0, PMC2: 0x0, PMC3: 0x0, PMC4: 0x0, PMC5: 0xd9a, PMC6: 0x80002011\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\n\nHere active PMC (from idx) is PMC5 , but overflown PMC is PMC6(0x80002011).\nWhen we handle PMI interrupt for such cases, if the PMC overflown is\nfrom inactive event, it will be ignored. Reference commit:\ncommit bc09c219b2e6 (\"powerpc/perf: Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt\")\n\nPatch addresses two changes:\n1) Fix 1 : Removal of warning ( WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending()); )\n   We were printing warning if no PMC is found overflown among active PMU\n   events, but PMI pending in PACA. But this could happen in cases where\n   PMC overflown is not in active PMC. An inactive event could have caused\n   the overflow. Hence the warning is not needed. To know pending PMI is\n   from an inactive event, we need to loop through all PMC's which will\n   cause more SPR reads via mfspr and increase in context switch. Also in\n   existing function: perf_event_interrupt, already we ignore PMI's\n   overflown when it is from an inactive PMC.\n\n2) Fix 2: optimization in clearing pending PMI.\n   Currently we check for any active PMC overflown before clearing PMI\n   pending in Paca. This is causing additional SP\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: Fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect\n\nusbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may\nsleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in\n-\u003endo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to -\u003edisconnect() by historic\ncommit \"[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock\":\n\n  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c\n\nThe change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue\nimplementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait\nfor completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that\ncould deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex\nheld in -\u003endo_stop().\n\nThe commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a\nuse-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,\nax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:\n\n* If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before\n  disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)\n  -\u003estatus() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().\n* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's -\u003elink_reset() callback,\n  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().\n* That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().\n\nBecause usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),\nnetif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and\nlinkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.\n\nIn 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of\nusbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf\n(\"drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()\").\n\nUnfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to\n-\u003endo_stop().

This\nwould lead to the aforementioned read out-of-bound. However, after\ncalling poly1305_init_arch(), only 16 bytes were deducted from the input\nand s[] is initialized yet again with the following 16 bytes. The second\ninitialization of s[] is certainly redundent which indicates that the\nfirst initialization should be for r[] only.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by calling poly1305_init_arm64() instead o\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc\n\nIn general, 'qlen' of any classful qdisc should keep track of the\nnumber of packets that the qdisc itself and all of its children holds.\nIn case of netem, 'qlen' only accounts for the packets in its internal\ntfifo. When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use\n'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created\nor dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics\nof netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.\n'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.\nIf a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent\nabout this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the\nnewly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.\nIf 'qlen' reaches the configured sch-\u003elimit, the enqueue function stops\nworking, even though the tfifo is not full.\n\nReproduce the bug:\nEnsure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root\nqdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine\nas follows:\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms\n\nSend bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3\nclient on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:\n$ tc -s qdisc show dev \u003coif\u003e\n\nStatistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that\nnetem's backlog \u003e limit, netem stopped accepting packets):\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\nStatistics after the fix:\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\ntbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.\nThe interface fully stops transferring packets and \"locks\". In this case,\nthe child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at\nits limit and no more packets are accepted.\n\nThis patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is\nonly decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not\nduring enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus\naccounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As\nin other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in\nnetem and all of its children. As before, sch-\u003elimit remains as the\nmaximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's\nbacklog statistics.",

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch-\u003elimit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '-\u003egraft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch-\u003elimit == 0`.\n - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.\n\nEnqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:\n - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -\u003e pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)\n - Qdisc_B-\u003eq.qlen += 1\n - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`\n - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` =\u003e hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.\n\nThe whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A-\u003eq.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B-\u003eq.qlen == 1.\nReplace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.\nThis violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.\n\nBug impact: This issue can be used for user-\u003ekernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.",
