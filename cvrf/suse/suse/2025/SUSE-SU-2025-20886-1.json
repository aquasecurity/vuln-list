In addition, AFAICT each async\nCOPY can copy an unlimited number of 4MB chunks, so can run for a\nlong time. Thus IMO async COPY can become a DoS vector.\n\nAdd a restriction mechanism that bounds the number of concurrent\nbackground COPY operations. Start simple and try to be fair -- this\npatch implements a per-namespace limit.\n\nAn async COPY request that occurs while this limit is exceeded gets\nNFS4ERR_DELAY. The requesting client can choose to send the request\nagain after a delay or fall back to a traditional read/write style\ncopy.\n\nIf there is need to make the mechanism more sophisticated, we can\nvisit that in future patches.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsunrpc: fix handling of server side tls alerts\n\nScott Mayhew discovered a security exploit in NFS over TLS in\ntls_alert_recv() due to its assumption it can read data from\nthe msg iterator's kvec..\n\nkTLS implementation splits TLS non-data record payload between\nthe control message buffer (which includes the type such as TLS\naler or TLS cipher change) and the rest of the payload (say TLS\nalert's level/description) which goes into the msg payload buffer.\n\nThis patch proposes to rework how control messages are setup and\nused by sock_recvmsg().\n\nIf no control message structure is setup, kTLS layer will read and\nprocess TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters a TLS control\nmessage, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a\nkvec backed msg buffer and read in the control message such as a\nTLS alert. Msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of\nthe copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling\ninto the tls_alert_recv.",
