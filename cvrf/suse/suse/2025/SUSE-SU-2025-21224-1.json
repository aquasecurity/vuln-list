Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS\nmessages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as\nModerate severity according to our Security Policy.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary.",

However, given that it is\npossible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled\nwith the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be\nrecoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate\nseverity issue.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.",

However the URLs used\nby these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.\n\nIn this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.\nFurthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be\npassed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have\na 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the\nissue was assessed as Low severity.\n\nThe vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:\n3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary.",
