[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and\nto an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.\n\nFix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater\nthan PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct\nread only access instead of the ecap_perms array.\n\nNote that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can\nexceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which\nare already checked before).\n\n[1]\n\nWARNING: CPU: 118 PID: 5329 at drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1900 vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\nCPU: 118 UID: 0 PID: 5329 Comm: simx-qemu-syste Not tainted 6.12.0+ #1\n(snip)\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n ? __warn+0x8d/0x140\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x244/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_rw+0x101/0x1b0 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_core_read+0x1d/0x30 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_device_fops_read+0x27/0x40 [vfio]\n vfs_read+0xbd/0x340\n ? vfio_device_fops_unl_ioctl+0xbb/0x740 [vfio]\n ? __rseq_handle_notify_resume+0xa4/0x4b0\n __x64_sys_pread64+0x96/0xc0\n x64_sys_call+0x1c3d/0x20d0\n do_syscall_64+0x4d/0x120\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.",
