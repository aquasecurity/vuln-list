These are now fixed.\n  * Fix: Python 3.14 defers evaluation of annotations by moving\n    them into separate code objects.

Large code bases should produce XML reports much\n    faster now.\n  * Fix: the LCOV report code assumed that a branch line that\n    took no branches meant that the entire line was unexecuted.\n    This isn't true in a few cases: the line might always raise\n    an exception, or might have been optimized away. Fixes issue\n    1896.\n  * Fix: similarly, the HTML report will now explain that a line\n    that jumps to none of its expected destinations must have\n    always raised an exception. Previously, it would say\n    something nonsensical like, 'line 4 didn't jump to line 5\n    because line 4 was never true, and it didn't jump to line 7\n    because line 4 was always true.'  This was also shown in\n    issue 1896.\n  * Fix: ugh, the other assert from 7.6.5 can also be encountered\n    in the wild, so it's been restored to a conditional.  Sorry\n    for the churn.\n  * One of the new asserts from 7.6.5 caused problems in real\n    projects, as reported in issue 1891.  The assert has been\n    removed.\n  * Fix: fine-tuned the exact Python version (3.12.6) when\n    exiting from with statements changed how they traced.  This\n    affected whether people saw the fix for `issue 1880`_.\n  * Fix: isolate our code more from mocking in the os module that\n    in rare cases can cause bizarre behavior.\n  * Refactor: some code unreachable code paths in parser.py were\n    changed to asserts.  If you encounter any of these, please\n    let me know!\n\n- update to 7.6.4:\n  * fix: multi-line with statements could cause contained\n    branches to be incorrectly marked as missing (issue 1880).\n    This is now fixed.\n  * Fix: nested context managers could incorrectly be analyzed to\n    flag a missing branch on the last context manager, as\n    described in issue 1876.  This is now fixed.\n  * Fix: the missing branch message about not exiting a module\n    had an extra 'didn't,' as described in issue 1873.  This is\n    now fixed.\n  * Dropped support for Python 3.8 and PyPy 3.8.\n  * Fix: a final wildcard match/case clause assigning to a name\n    (case _ as value) was incorrectly marked as a missing branch.\n    This is now fixed, closing issue 1860.\n  * Fewer things are considered branches now. Lambdas,\n    comprehensions, and generator expressions are no longer\n    marked as missing branches if they don't complete execution.\n    Closes issue 1852.\n  * Fix: the HTML report didn't properly show multi-line\n    f-strings that end with a backslash continuation.  This is\n    now fixed, closing issue 1836, thanks to LiuYinCarl and Marco\n    Ricci.\n  * Fix: the LCOV report now has correct line numbers (fixing\n    issue 1846) and better branch descriptions for BRDA records\n    (fixing issue 1850).  There are other changes to lcov also,\n    including a new configuration option :ref:`line_checksums\n    \u003cconfig_lcov_line_checksums\u003e` to control whether line\n    checksums are included in the lcov report.  The default is\n    false. To keep checksums set it to true.  All this work is\n    thanks to Zack Weinberg (pull 1849 and pull 1851).\n  * Fixed the docs for multi-line regex exclusions, closing issue\n    1863.\n  * Fixed a potential crash in the C tracer, closing issue 1835,\n    thanks to Jan Kühle.\n\n- update to 7.6.1:\n  * Fix: coverage used to fail when measuring code using\n    :func:`runpy.run_path \u003cpython:runpy.run_path\u003e` with a\n    :class:`Path \u003cpython:pathlib.Path\u003e` argument. This is now\n    fixed, thanks to Ask Hjorth Larsen.\n  * Fix: backslashes preceding a multi-line backslashed string\n    could confuse the HTML report.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n    LiuYinCarl.\n  * Now we publish wheels for Python 3.13, both regular and free-\n    threaded.\n  * Exclusion patterns can now be multi-line, thanks to Daniel\n    Diniz.  This enables many interesting exclusion use-cases,\n    including those requested in issues 118 (entire files), 996\n    (multiple lines only when appearing together), 1741\n    (remainder of a function), and 1803 (arbitrary sequence of\n    marked lines).  See the :ref:`multi_line_exclude` section of\n    the docs for more details and examples.\n  * The JSON report now includes per-function and per-class\n    coverage information. Thanks to Daniel Diniz for getting the\n    work started. This closes issue 1793 and issue 1532.\n  * Fixed an incorrect calculation of '(no class)' lines in the\n    HTML classes report.\n  * Python 3.13.0b3 is supported.\n  * If you attempt to combine statement coverage data with branch\n    coverage data, coverage.py used to fail with the message\n    'Can't combine arc data with line data' or its reverse,\n    'Can't combine line data with arc data.'  These messages used\n    internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand\n    the problem.  They are now changed to mention 'branch\n    coverage data' and 'statement coverage data.'\n  * Fixed a minor branch coverage problem with wildcard\n    match/case cases using names or guard clauses.\n  * Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of\n    Python.  I'm not claiming full support yet.  Closes issue\n    1799.\n\n- update to 7.5.3:\n  * Performance improvements for combining data files, especially\n    when measuring line coverage. A few different quadratic\n    behaviors were eliminated. In one extreme case of combining\n    700+ data files, the time dropped from more than three hours\n    to seven minutes.  Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the\n    fix.\n  * Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a\n    side benefit of reducing memory use, closing issue 1791.\n    Thanks to Daniel Diniz for helping to diagnose the problem.\n  * Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too\n    much code, as reported in issue 1779.  This is now fixed.\n  * Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module\n    docstring to be an executable statement if it appeared after\n    line 1 in the file, but not executable if it was the first\n    line.  Now module docstrings are never counted as executable\n    statements.  This can change coverage.py's count of the\n    number of statements in a file, which can slightly change the\n    coverage percentage reported.\n  * In the HTML report, the filter term and 'hide covered'\n    checkbox settings are remembered between viewings, thanks to\n    Daniel Diniz.\n  * Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.\n  * Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre\n    source files are handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz\n    fuzzing, thanks to Liam DeVoe. Closes issue 1787.\n\n- Update to 7.5.1:\n  * Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement\n    now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is\n    on the first line.\n  * Fix: very complex source files could cause a maximum recursion error when\n    creating an HTML report.\n  * HTML report improvements:\n    + Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have\n      hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of\n      stale cached copies.\n    + Missing branch coverage explanations that said 'the condition was never\n      false' now read 'the condition was always true' because it's easier to\n      understand.\n    + Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index\n      pages.\n  * Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report.\n  * Other HTML report improvements:\n    + There is now a 'hide covered' checkbox to filter out 100% files.\n    + The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer\n      indications of the sorting.\n    + The 'previous file' shortcut key didn't work on the index page, but now\n      it does.\n  * The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows\n    absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren't taking\n    effect, and is renamed from 'attempted_config_files' to the more logical\n    'config_files_attempted.'\n  * Fix: in some cases, even with [run] relative_files=True, a data file\n    could be created with absolute path names.  When combined with other\n    relative data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would\n    be made relative or not. If they weren't, then a file would be listed\n    twice in reports.\n  * Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if\n    the branch was missed.  It said the pattern never matched, when actually\n    the branch is missed if the last case always matched.\n  * Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more\n    accurately.\n  * Fix: the report:format setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a\n    string.\n  * Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: 'Set changed\n    size during iteration.'\n  * Fix: setting COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon no longer errors on 3.11 and lower.\n  * Fix: the JSON report now includes an explicit format version number.\n  * Fix: the change for multi-line signature exclusions in 7.3.3 broke other\n    forms of nested clauses being excluded properly.\n  * Fix: in the HTML report, selecting code for copying won't select the line\n    numbers also. Thanks, `Robert Harris \u003cpull 1717_\u003e`_.\n  * Fix: function definitions with multi-line signatures can now be excluded\n    by matching any of the lines.\n  * Fix: XML reports could fail with a TypeError if files had numeric\n    components that were duplicates except for leading zeroes, like file1.py\n    and file001.py.\n  * The coverage annotate command used to announce that it would be removed\n    in a future version. Enough people got in touch to say that they use it,\n    so it will stay. Don't expect it to keep up with other new features though.\n- Set COVERAGE_CORE, so we no longer need to skip the ctrace tests, it will be\n  handled for us.\n- Skip two tests that assert PYTHONPATH is empty, which it can't be.\n\n- update to 7.3.2:\n  * The ``coverage lcov`` command ignored the ``[report]\n    exclude_lines`` and ``[report] exclude_also`` settings\n  * Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the\n    coverage.py database files.  These are ephemeral, but could\n    be mistakenly included when combining data files.\n  * On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files,\n    which should be a little faster.\n  * The new 3.12 soft keyword ``type`` is properly bolded in HTML\n    reports.\n  * Removed the 'fullcoverage' feature used by CPython to measure\n    the coverage of early-imported standard library modules.\n\n- update to 7.3.1:\n  * The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in\n    the docs.  A leading or trailing star matches any number of path\n    components, like a double star would.  This is different than\n    the behavior of a star in the middle of a pattern.\n\n- specfile\n  * fix build on Leap 15 by moving sle15_python_module_pythons macro\n    to the top\n\n- specfile:\n  * require python 3.8\n- update to version 7.3.0:\n  * Added a Coverage.collect() context manager to start and stop\n    coverage data collection.\n  * Dropped support for Python 3.7.\n  * Fix: in unusual circumstances, SQLite cannot be set to\n    asynchronous mode. Coverage.py would fail with the error Safety\n    level may not be changed inside a transaction. This is now\n    avoided, closing issue 1646. Thanks to Michael Bell for the\n    detailed bug report.\n  * Docs: examples of configuration files now include separate\n    examples for the different syntaxes: .coveragerc, pyproject.toml,\n    setup.cfg, and tox.ini.\n  * Fix: added nosemgrep comments to our JavaScript code so that\n    semgrep-based SAST security checks won’t raise false alarms about\n    security problems that aren’t problems.\n  * Added a CITATION.cff file, thanks to Ken Schackart.\n\n- specfile:\n  * removed upstream patch\n- update to version 7.2.7:\n  * Fix: reverted a change from 6.4.3 that helped Cython, but also\n    increased the size of data files when using dynamic contexts, as\n    described in the now-fixed issue 1586. The problem is now avoided\n    due to a recent change (issue 1538). Thanks to Anders Kaseorg and\n    David Szotten for persisting with problem reports and detailed\n    diagnoses.\n  * Wheels are now provided for CPython 3.12.\n- changes from version 7.2.6:\n  * Fix: the lcov command could raise an IndexError exception if a\n    file is translated to Python but then executed under its own\n    name. Jinja2 does this when rendering templates. Fixes issue 1553.\n  * Python 3.12 beta 1 now inlines comprehensions. Previously they\n    were compiled as invisible functions and coverage.py would warn\n    you if they weren’t completely executed. This no longer happens\n    under Python 3.12.\n  * Fix: the coverage debug sys command includes some environment\n    variables in its output. This could have included sensitive\n    data. Those values are now hidden with asterisks, closing issue\n    1628.\n\n    since 6.4.3.\n- Handle cases where python2 is disabled\n- add LICENSE.txt\n- python3 package added\n- minor spec improvement (files section)\n\nChanges in python-flaky:\n- Update to 3.8.1: \n  * Support pytest \u003e= 8.1.1, and Python \u003e= 3.12.\n- Drop patches, included upstream.\n- Switch to pyproject macros.\n\n- Add patch to remove dependency on the external\n  genty package (gh#box/flaky!197).\n\n- Clean up the SPEC file\n\n\nChanges in python-pluggy:\n- Update to 1.5.0:\n  * Features\n    + Add support for deprecating specific hook parameters, or more\n      generally, for issuing a warning whenever a hook implementation\n      requests certain parameters.\n    + A warning ~pluggy.PluggyTeardownRaisedWarning is now issued when an\n      old-style hookwrapper raises an exception during teardown.\n    + Add PluginManager.unblock \u003cpluggy.PluginManager.unblock\u003e method to\n      unblock a plugin by plugin name.\n  * Bug Fixes\n    + PluginManager.get_plugins() no longer returns None for blocked plugins.\n    + Fix ~pluggy.HookCaller.call_extra() extra methods getting ordered\n      before everything else in some circumstances. Regressed in pluggy 1.1.0.\n    + Fix plugins registering other plugins in a hook when the other plugins\n      implement the same hook itself. Regressed in pluggy 1.1.0.\n- Switch to pyproject macros.\n\n- Revert to 1.3.0\n  * Pytest 7 is not compatible with pluggy 1.4 but many packages\n    are not compatible with pytest 8 yet\n\n- update to 1.4.0:\n  * A warning :class:`~pluggy.PluggyTeardownRaisedWarning`\n    is now issued when an old-style hookwrapper raises an\n    exception during teardown. See the warning documentation for\n    more details.\n  * Add :func:`PluginManager.unblock\n    \u003cpluggy.PluginManager.unblock\u003e` method to unblock a plugin by\n    plugin name.\n  * Fix :func:`~pluggy.HookCaller.call_extra()` extra\n    methods getting ordered before everything else in some\n    circumstances. Regressed in pluggy 1.1.0.\n  * Fix plugins registering other plugins in a hook when\n    the other plugins implement the same hook itself. Regressed\n    in pluggy 1.1.0.\n\n- update to 1.3.0:\n  * Python 3.7 is no longer supported.\n  * Pluggy now exposes its typings to static type checkers.\n  * Some fields and classes are marked ``Final`` and ``@final``.\n  * The :ref:`api-reference` is updated to clearly delineate\n    pluggy's public API.\n    Compatibility aliases are put in place for the renamed types.\n    Please note that pluggy is currently unable to provide strong\n    typing for hook calls, e.g. ``pm.hook.my_hook(...)``,\n    nor to statically check that a hook implementation matches\n    the hook specification's type.\n  * The new-style hook wrappers, added in the yanked 1.1.0\n    release, now require an explicit ``wrapper=True`` designation\n    in the ``@hookimpl()`` decorator.\n\n  Deprecations and Removals\n    The deprecation was announced in release 0.7.0.\n    deprecation was announced in release 0.7.0.\n    deprecation was announced in release 0.6.0.\n  * fix issue #4: specific HookCallError exception for when a hook call\n\nChanges in python-pytest-cov:\n- Update to 6.2.1:\n  * Added a version requirement for pytest's pluggy dependency.\n  * Removed deprecated license classifier (packaging).\n  * The plugin now adds 3 rules in the filter warnings configuration to\n    prevent common coverage warnings being raised as obscure errors.\n  * Fixed breakage that occurs when ``--cov-context`` and the ``no_cover``\n    marker are used together.\n  * Change terminal output to use full width lines for the coverage header.\n  * Removed unnecessary CovFailUnderWarning.\n  * Fixed the term report not using the precision specified via\n    ``--cov-precision``.\n  * Changed fail under checks to use the precision set in the coverage\n    configuration.\n  * Added a ``--cov-precision`` cli option that can override the value set\n    in your coverage configuration.\n  * Dropped support for now EOL Python 3.8.\n\n- Switch to pytest macro.\n- Add patch to support changes in coverage 7.5.\n\n- update to 5.0.0:\n  * Removed support for xdist rsync (now deprecated).\n  * Switched docs theme to Furo.\n  * Various legacy Python cleanup and CI improvements.\n    Contributed by Christian Clauss and Hugo van Kemenade in\n    #630, #631, #632 and #633.\n  * Added a pyproject.toml example in the docs.
