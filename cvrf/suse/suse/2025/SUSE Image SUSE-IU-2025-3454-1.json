In our case it's\n  (un)selected by build script depending on whether KABI reference is\n  defined for given arch-flavor and whether check is really requested by\n  the user. Default value is 'n' so that people building merely via\n  Makefile (not RPM with KABI checking) obtain consistent config.\n- commit a007049\n\n- gfs2: No more self recovery (bsc#1248639 CVE-2025-38659).\n- gfs2: Get rid of gfs2_glock_queue_put in signal_our_withdraw\n  (bsc#1248639 CVE-2025-38659).\n- commit d2aba16\n\n- usb: gadget: udc: core: Offload usb_udc_vbus_handler processing\n  (CVE-2022-49980 bsc#1245110).\n- commit b9c8803\n\n- ice: Fix a null pointer dereference in ice_copy_and_init_pkg()\n  (CVE-2025-38664 bsc#1248628).\n- commit 5eff097\n\n- wifi: mac80211: reject TDLS operations when station is not\n  associated (CVE-2025-38644 bsc#1248748).\n- commit a8c476b\n\n- vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY (bsc#1248511\n  CVE-2025-38618).\n- commit 33452e8\n\n- USB: gadget: Fix obscure lockdep violation for udc_mutex\n  (CVE-2022-49980 bsc#1245110).\n- commit 25d2f46\n\n- usb: gadget: core: do not try to disconnect gadget if it is\n  not connected (CVE-2022-49980 bsc#1245110).\n- commit a760fdc\n\n- tipc: fix null-ptr-deref when acquiring remote ip of ethernet bearer (CVE-2025-38184 bsc#1245956)\n- commit 9365d7a\n\n- kernel-binary: Another installation ordering fix (bsc#1241353).\n- commit fe14ab5\n\n- USB: gadget: Fix use-after-free Read in usb_udc_uevent()\n  (CVE-2022-49980 bsc#1245110).\n- commit dffc69a\n\n- atm: clip: Fix memory leak of struct clip_vcc (CVE-2025-38546\n  bsc#1248223).\n- atm: clip: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in to_atmarpd()\n  (CVE-2025-38460 bsc#1247143).\n- tls: stop recv() if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATA\n  (CVE-2024-58239 bsc#1248614).\n- tls: rx: drop pointless else after goto (CVE-2024-58239\n  bsc#1248614).\n- commit 47416a2\n\n- x86/sev: Evict cache lines during SNP memory validation\n  (CVE-2025-38560 bsc#1248312).\n- commit 766631f\n\n- selftests/perf_events: Add a mmap() correctness test\n  (CVE-2025-38563 bsc#1248306 selftest).\n- commit b58bec8\n\n- perf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings (CVE-2025-38563\n  bsc#1248306).\n- commit 30b2db8\n\n- perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail (CVE-2025-38563\n  bsc#1248306 dependency).\n- commit 037df8e\n\n- perf/core: Don't leak AUX buffer refcount on allocation failure\n  (CVE-2025-38563 bsc#1248306 dependency).\n- commit 4273af9\n\n- bpf, ktls: Fix data corruption when using bpf_msg_pop_data()\n  in ktls (bsc#1248338 CVE-2025-38608).\n- commit 43a92df\n\n- build_bug.h: Add KABI assert (bsc#1249186).\n- commit 6e38849\n\n- usb: gadget : fix use-after-free in composite_dev_cleanup()\n  (CVE-2025-38555 bsc#1248297).\n- commit d29d36a\n\n- clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns (CVE-2025-38499 bsc#1247976)\n- commit 767ab57\n\n- net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and\n  packet_notifier() (CVE-2025-38617 bsc#1248621).\n- commit a477bef\n\n- Update config files.

If the values\n  differ, it then invokes 'ksymtypes compare' to provide a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols differ. The build expects the latter\n  'ksymtypes compare' command to always return zero, even if the two\n  compared kABI corpuses are different.\n  This is currently the case for 'ksymtypes compare'. However, I plan to\n  update the command to return a non-zero code when the comparison detects\n  any differences. This should ensure consistent behavior with 'ksymvers\n  compare'.\n  Since the build uses 'ksymtypes compare' only for more detailed\n  diagnostics, ignore its return code.\n- commit 5ac1381\n\n-

During this operation, genksyms\n  is invoked for each source file. The tool determines type signatures of\n  all exports within the file, reports any differences compared to the\n  associated symref reference, calculates symbol CRCs from the signatures\n  and writes new type data into a symtypes file.\n  * The script rpm/modversions is invoked again, this time it packs all new\n  symtypes files to a consolidated kABI file.\n  * The downstream script rpm/kabi.pl checks symbol CRCs in the new build and\n  compares them to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking\n  kabi/severities into account.\n  suse-kabi-tools is a new set of tools to improve the kABI checking process.\n  The suite includes two tools, ksymtypes and ksymvers, which replace the\n  existing scripts rpm/modversions and rpm/kabi.pl, as well as the comparison\n  functionality previously provided by genksyms. The tools have their own\n  source repository and package.\n  The tools provide faster operation and more detailed, unified output. In\n  addition, they allow the use of the new upstream tool gendwarfksyms, which\n  lacks any built-in comparison functionality.\n  The updated workflow is as follows:\n  * The build performs a regular kernel make. During this operation, genksyms\n  (gendwarfksyms) is invoked as usual, determinining signatures and CRCs of\n  all exports and writing the type data to symtypes files. However,\n  genksyms no longer performs any comparison.\n  * 'ksymtypes consolidate' packs all new symtypes files to a consolidated\n  kABI file.\n  * 'ksymvers compare' checks symbol CRCs in the new build and compares them\n  to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking kabi/severities\n  into account. The tool writes its result in a human-readable form on\n  standard output and also writes a list of all changed exports (not\n  ignored by kabi/severities) to the changed-exports file.\n  * 'ksymtypes compare' takes the changed-exports file, the consolidated kABI\n  symtypes reference data from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symtypes-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt; and the new\n  consolidated data. Based on this data, it produces a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols changed.\n  The patch enables the use of suse-kabi-tools via rpm/config.sh, providing\n  explicit control to each branch. To enable the support, set\n  USE_SUSE_KABI_TOOLS=Yes in the config file.\n- commit a2c6f89\n\n- netfilter: nft_chain_filter: handle NETDEV_UNREGISTER for\n  inet/ingress basechain (CVE-2024-26808 bsc#1222634).\n- commit 8ae94b6\n\n- netfilter: nft_set_rbtree: .deactivate fails if element has\n  expired (CVE-2024-27397 bsc#1224095).\n- commit 544c57e\n\n- kernel-source: Remove log.sh from sources\n- commit 96bd779\n\n- netfilter: ipset: add missing range check in bitmap_ip_uadt (CVE-2024-53141 bsc#1234381)\n- commit 6255020\n\n- net_sched: hfsc: Fix a potential UAF in hfsc_dequeue() too\n  (CVE-2025-37823 bsc#1242924).\n- commit 10fd231\n\n- net: sched: sch_multiq: fix possible OOB write in multiq_tune()\n  (CVE-2024-36978 bsc#1226514).\n- commit 6416785\n\n- sch_hfsc: Fix qlen accounting bug when using peek in\n  hfsc_enqueue() (CVE-2025-38000 bsc#1244277).\n- commit 411bb06\n\n- net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem\n  as child qdisc (CVE-2025-37890 bsc#1243330).\n- commit 33c0be8\n\n- netfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash types\n  (CVE-2025-37997 bsc#1243832).\n- commit e26a95e\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: don't fail inserts if duplicate has\n  expired (git-fixes CVE-2023-52925 bsc#1236822).\n- commit cd97e1a\n\n- netfilter: nf_tables: don't skip expired elements during walk\n  (CVE-2023-52924 bsc#1236821).\n- Refresh\n  patches.suse/netfilter-nft_set_pipapo-skip-inactive-elements-duri.patch.\n- commit 6faff42\n\n- bpf: sync_linked_regs() must preserve subreg_def (bsc#1234156\n  CVE-2024-53125).\n- commit 29ff5bf\n\n- net: sched: Disallow replacing of child qdisc from one parent\n  to another (CVE-2025-21700 bsc#1237159).\n- commit 7b38bc0\n\n- vsock: Orphan socket after transport release (bsc#1238876\n  CVE-2025-21756).\n- commit 7e39328\n\n- vsock: Keep the binding until socket destruction (bsc#1238876\n  CVE-2025-21756).\n- commit a3adf03\n\n- netem: Update sch-\u0026gt;q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()\n  (git-fixes CVE-2025-21703 bsc#1237313).\n- commit 6fdf91c\n\n- pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch-\u0026gt;limit == 0 (CVE-2025-21702 bsc#1237312)\n- commit 874558c\n\n- net_sched: sch_fifo: implement lockless __fifo_dump() (bsc#1237312)\n- commit a5fc425\n\n- netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element\n  (CVE-2024-26924 bsc#1223387).\n- commit b8b066b\n\n- net/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc\n  (CVE-2024-56770 bsc#1235637).\n- sch/netem: fix use after free in netem_dequeue (CVE-2024-56770\n  bsc#1235637 CVE-2024-46800 bsc#1230827).\n- commit a31493e\n\n- mkspec: Exclude rt flavor from kernel-syms dependencies (bsc#1244337).\n- commit 7c95ae0\n\n- powerpc/vas: Return -EINVAL if the offset is non-zero in mmap()\n  (bsc#1244309 ltc#213790).\n- powerpc/powernv/memtrace: Fix out of bounds issue in memtrace\n  mmap (bsc#1244309 ltc#213790).\n- commit 85e9dad\n\n- MyBS: Do not build kernel-obs-qa with limit_packages\n  Fixes: 58e3f8c34b2b (\u0026quot;bs-upload-kernel: Pass limit_packages also on multibuild\u0026quot;)\n- commit f4c6047\n\n- MyBS: Simplify qa_expr generation\n  Start with a 0 which makes the expression valid even if there are no QA\n  repositories (currently does not happen).

      "Description": "regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix space cache corruption and potential double allocations\n\nWhen testing space_cache v2 on a large set of machines, we encountered a\nfew symptoms:\n\n1. \"unable to add free space :-17\" (EEXIST) errors.\n2. Missing free space info items, sometimes caught with a \"missing free\n   space info for X\" error.\n3. Double-accounted space: ranges that were allocated in the extent tree\n   and also marked as free in the free space tree, ranges that were\n   marked as allocated twice in the extent tree, or ranges that were\n   marked as free twice in the free space tree. If the latter made it\n   onto disk, the next reboot would hit the BUG_ON() in\n   add_new_free_space().\n4. On some hosts with no on-disk corruption or error messages, the\n   in-memory space cache (dumped with drgn) disagreed with the free\n   space tree.\n\nAll of these symptoms have the same underlying cause: a race between\ncaching the free space for a block group and returning free space to the\nin-memory space cache for pinned extents causes us to double-add a free\nrange to the space cache. This race exists when free space is cached\nfrom the free space tree (space_cache=v2) or the extent tree\n(nospace_cache, or space_cache=v1 if the cache needs to be regenerated).\nstruct btrfs_block_group::last_byte_to_unpin and struct\nbtrfs_block_group::progress are supposed to protect against this race,\nbut commit d0c2f4fa555e (\"btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when\nwaiting for a transaction commit\") subtly broke this by allowing\nmultiple transactions to be unpinning extents at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, the race is as follows:\n\n1. An extent is deleted from an uncached block group in transaction A.\n2. btrfs_commit_transaction() is called for transaction A.\n3. btrfs_run_delayed_refs() -\u003e __btrfs_free_extent() runs the delayed\n   ref for the deleted extent.\n4. __btrfs_free_extent() -\u003e do_free_extent_accounting() -\u003e\n   add_to_free_space_tree() adds the deleted extent back to the free\n   space tree.\n5. do_free_extent_accounting() -\u003e btrfs_update_block_group() -\u003e\n   btrfs_cache_block_group() queues up the block group to get cached.\n   block_group-\u003eprogress is set to block_group-\u003estart.\n6. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls\n   switch_commit_roots(). It sets block_group-\u003elast_byte_to_unpin to\n   block_group-\u003eprogress, which is block_group-\u003estart because the block\n   group hasn't been cached yet.\n7. The caching thread gets to our block group. Since the commit roots\n   were already switched, load_free_space_tree() sees the deleted extent\n   as free and adds it to the space cache. It finishes caching and sets\n   block_group-\u003eprogress to U64_MAX.\n8. btrfs_commit_transaction() advances transaction A to\n   TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED.\n9. fsync calls btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B. Since\n   transaction A is already in TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED and the\n   commit is for fsync, it advances.\n10. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B calls\n    switch_commit_roots(). This time, the block group has already been\n    cached, so it sets block_group-\u003elast_byte_to_unpin to U64_MAX.\n11. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls\n    btrfs_finish_extent_commit(), which calls unpin_extent_range() for\n    the deleted extent. It sees last_byte_to_unpin set to U64_MAX (by\n    transaction B!), so it adds the deleted extent to the space cache\n    again!\n\nThis explains all of our symptoms above:\n\n* If the sequence of events is exactly as described above, when the free\n  space is re-added in step 11, it will fail with EEXIST.\n* If another thread reallocates the deleted extent in between steps 7\n  and 11, then step 11 will silently re-add that space to the space\n  cache as free even though it is actually allocated. Then, if that\n  space is allocated *again*, the free space tree will be corrupted\n  (namely, the wrong item will be deleted).\n* If we don't catch this free space tree corr\n---truncated---",

This solves the locking issue, keeps latency low and provides\ngood performance on high data load.\nNote that now all packets from a DLCI are removed from the internal queue\nif the associated DLCI was closed. This ensures that no data is sent by the\nintroduced write task to an already closed DLCI.\n\nBUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, test_v24_loop/124\n lock: serial8250_ports+0x3a8/0x7500, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: test_v24_loop/124, .owner_cpu: 0\nCPU: 0 PID: 124 Comm: test_v24_loop Tainted: G           O      5.18.0-rc2 #3\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x34/0x44\n do_raw_spin_lock+0x76/0xa0\n _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x72/0x80\n uart_write_room+0x3b/0xc0\n gsm_data_kick+0x14b/0x240 [n_gsm]\n gsmld_write_wakeup+0x35/0x70 [n_gsm]\n tty_wakeup+0x53/0x60\n tty_port_default_wakeup+0x1b/0x30\n serial8250_tx_chars+0x12f/0x220\n serial8250_handle_irq.part.0+0xfe/0x150\n serial8250_default_handle_irq+0x48/0x80\n serial8250_interrupt+0x56/0xa0\n __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x78/0x1f0\n handle_irq_event+0x34/0x70\n handle_fasteoi_irq+0x90/0x1e0\n __common_interrupt+0x69/0x100\n common_interrupt+0x48/0xc0\n asm_common_interrupt+0x1e/0x40\nRIP: 0010:__do_softirq+0x83/0x34e\nCode: 2a 0a ff 0f b7 ed c7 44 24 10 0a 00 00 00 48 c7 c7 51 2a 64 82 e8 2d\ne2 d5 ff 65 66 c7 05 83 af 1e 7e 00 00 fb b8 ff ff ff ff \u003c49\u003e c7 c2 40 61\n80 82 0f bc c5 41 89 c4 41 83 c4 01 0f 84 e6 00 00\nRSP: 0018:ffffc90000003f98 EFLAGS: 00000286\nRAX: 00000000ffffffff RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffffff82642a51 RDI: ffffffff825bb5e7\nRBP: 0000000000000200 R08: 00000008de3271a8 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000030 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n ? __do_softirq+0x73/0x34e\n irq_exit_rcu+0xb5/0x100\n common_interrupt+0xa4/0xc0\n \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n asm_common_interrupt+0x1e/0x40\nRIP: 0010:_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x2e/0x50\nCode: 00 55 48 89 fd 48 83 c7 18 53 48 89 f3 48 8b 74 24 10 e8 85 28 36 ff\n48 89 ef e8 cd 58 36 ff 80 e7 02 74 01 fb bf 01 00 00 00 \u003ce8\u003e 3d 97 33 ff\n65 8b 05 96 23 2b 7e 85 c0 74 03 5b 5d c3 0f 1f 44\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000020fd08 EFLAGS: 00000202\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000246 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000004 RSI: ffffffff8257fd74 RDI: 0000000000000001\nRBP: ffff8880057de3a0 R08: 00000008de233000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000100 R14: 0000000000000202 R15: ffff8880057df0b8\n ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x23/0x50\n gsmtty_write+0x65/0x80 [n_gsm]\n n_tty_write+0x33f/0x530\n ? swake_up_all+0xe0/0xe0\n file_tty_write.constprop.0+0x1b1/0x320\n ? n_tty_flush_buffer+0xb0/0xb0\n new_sync_write+0x10c/0x190\n vfs_write+0x282/0x310\n ksys_write+0x68/0xe0\n do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\nRIP: 0033:0x7f3e5e35c15c\nCode: 8b 7c 24 08 89 c5 e8 c5 ff ff ff 89 ef 89 44 24\n---truncated---",

The function\n\"any_pmc_overflown\" checks the PMCs on active events in\ncpuhw-\u003en_events. Code snippet:\n\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\nif (any_pmc_overflown(cpuhw))\n \tclear_pmi_irq_pending();\n else\n \tWARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending());\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\n\nHere the PMC overflown is not from active event. Example: When we do\nperf record, default cycles and instructions will be running on PMC6\nand PMC5 respectively. It could happen that overflowed event is currently\nnot active and pending PMI is for the inactive event. Debug logs from\ntrace_printk:\n\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\nany_pmc_overflown: idx is 5: pmc value is 0xd9a\npower_pmu_disable: PMC1: 0x0, PMC2: 0x0, PMC3: 0x0, PMC4: 0x0, PMC5: 0xd9a, PMC6: 0x80002011\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e\n\nHere active PMC (from idx) is PMC5 , but overflown PMC is PMC6(0x80002011).\nWhen we handle PMI interrupt for such cases, if the PMC overflown is\nfrom inactive event, it will be ignored. Reference commit:\ncommit bc09c219b2e6 (\"powerpc/perf: Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt\")\n\nPatch addresses two changes:\n1) Fix 1 : Removal of warning ( WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending()); )\n   We were printing warning if no PMC is found overflown among active PMU\n   events, but PMI pending in PACA. But this could happen in cases where\n   PMC overflown is not in active PMC. An inactive event could have caused\n   the overflow. Hence the warning is not needed. To know pending PMI is\n   from an inactive event, we need to loop through all PMC's which will\n   cause more SPR reads via mfspr and increase in context switch. Also in\n   existing function: perf_event_interrupt, already we ignore PMI's\n   overflown when it is from an inactive PMC.\n\n2) Fix 2: optimization in clearing pending PMI.\n   Currently we check for any active PMC overflown before clearing PMI\n   pending in Paca. This is causing additional SP\n---truncated---",

Currently\nwait_for_device_probe() from snapshot_open() from misc_open() can sleep\nforever with misc_mtx held if probe_count cannot become 0.\n\nWhen a device is probed by hub_event() work function, probe_count is\nincremented before the probe function starts, and probe_count is\ndecremented after the probe function completed.\n\nThere are three cases that can prevent probe_count from dropping to 0.\n\n  (a) A device being probed stopped responding (i.e. broken/malicious\n      hardware).\n\n  (b) A process emulating a USB device using /dev/raw-gadget interface\n      stopped responding for some reason.\n\n  (c) New device probe requests keeps coming in before existing device\n      probe requests complete.\n\nThe phenomenon syzbot is reporting is (b). A process which is holding\nsystem_transition_mutex and misc_mtx is waiting for probe_count to become\n0 inside wait_for_device_probe(), but the probe function which is called\n from hub_event() work function is waiting for the processes which are\nblocked at mutex_lock(\u0026misc_mtx) to respond via /dev/raw-gadget interface.\n\nThis patch mitigates (b) by deferring wait_for_device_probe() from\nsnapshot_open() to snapshot_write() and snapshot_ioctl(). Please note that\nthe possibility of (b) remains as long as any thread which is emulating a\nUSB device via /dev/raw-gadget interface can be blocked by uninterruptible\nblocking operations (e.g. mutex_lock()).\n\nPlease also note that (a) and (c) are not addressed. Regarding (c), we\nshould change the code to wait for only one device which contains the\nimage for resuming from hibernation. I don't know how to address (a), for\nuse of timeout for wait_for_device_probe() might result in loss of user\ndata in the image. Maybe we should require the userland to wait for the\nimage device before opening /dev/snapshot interface.",

But in 2003, that was moved to -\u003edisconnect() by historic\ncommit \"[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock\":\n\n  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c\n\nThe change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue\nimplementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait\nfor completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that\ncould deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex\nheld in -\u003endo_stop().\n\nThe commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a\nuse-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,\nax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:\n\n* If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before\n  disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)\n  -\u003estatus() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().\n* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's -\u003elink_reset() callback,\n  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().\n* That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().\n\nBecause usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),\nnetif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and\nlinkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.\n\nIn 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of\nusbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf\n(\"drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()\").\n\nUnfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to\n-\u003endo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/gntdev: Prevent leaking grants\n\nPrior to this commit, if a grant mapping operation failed partially,\nsome of the entries in the map_ops array would be invalid, whereas all\nof the entries in the kmap_ops array would be valid. This in turn would\ncause the following logic in gntdev_map_grant_pages to become invalid:\n\n  for (i = 0; i \u003c map-\u003ecount; i++) {\n    if (map-\u003emap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {\n      map-\u003eunmap_ops[i].handle = map-\u003emap_ops[i].handle;\n      if (!use_ptemod)\n        alloced++;\n    }\n    if (use_ptemod) {\n      if (map-\u003ekmap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {\n        if (map-\u003emap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay)\n          alloced++;\n        map-\u003ekunmap_ops[i].handle = map-\u003ekmap_ops[i].handle;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n  atomic_add(alloced, \u0026map-\u003elive_grants);\n\nAssume that use_ptemod is true (i.e., the domain mapping the granted\npages is a paravirtualized domain). In the code excerpt above, note that\nthe \"alloced\" variable is only incremented when both kmap_ops[i].status\nand map_ops[i].status are set to GNTST_okay (i.e., both mapping\noperations are successful).  However, as also noted above, there are\ncases where a grant mapping operation fails partially, breaking the\nassumption of the code excerpt above.\n\nThe aforementioned causes map-\u003elive_grants to be incorrectly set. In\nsome cases, all of the map_ops mappings fail, but all of the kmap_ops\nmappings succeed, meaning that live_grants may remain zero. This in turn\nmakes it impossible to unmap the successfully grant-mapped pages pointed\nto by kmap_ops, because unmap_grant_pages has the following snippet of\ncode at its beginning:\n\n  if (atomic_read(\u0026map-\u003elive_grants) == 0)\n    return; /* Nothing to do */\n\nIn other cases where only some of the map_ops mappings fail but all\nkmap_ops mappings succeed, live_grants is made positive, but when the\nuser requests unmapping the grant-mapped pages, __unmap_grant_pages_done\nwill then make map-\u003elive_grants negative, because the latter function\ndoes not check if all of the pages that were requested to be unmapped\nwere actually unmapped, and the same function unconditionally subtracts\n\"data-\u003ecount\" (i.e., a value that can be greater than map-\u003elive_grants)\nfrom map-\u003elive_grants. The side effects of a negative live_grants value\nhave not been studied.\n\nThe net effect of all of this is that grant references are leaked in one\nof the above conditions. In Qubes OS v4.1 (which uses Xen's grant\nmechanism extensively for X11 GUI isolation), this issue manifests\nitself with warning messages like the following to be printed out by the\nLinux kernel in the VM that had granted pages (that contain X11 GUI\nwindow data) to dom0: \"g.e. 0x1234 still pending\", especially after the\nuser rapidly resizes GUI VM windows (causing some grant-mapping\noperations to partially or completely fail, due to the fact that the VM\nunshares some of the pages as part of the window resizing, making the\npages impossible to grant-map from dom0).\n\nThe fix for this issue involves counting all successful map_ops and\nkmap_ops mappings separately, and then adding the sum to live_grants.\nDuring unmapping, only the number of successfully unmapped grants is\nsubtracted from live_grants. The code is also modified to check for\nnegative live_grants values after the subtraction and warn the user.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm: Make .remove and .shutdown HW shutdown consistent\n\nDrivers' .remove and .shutdown callbacks are executed on different code\npaths. The former is called when a device is removed from the bus, while\nthe latter is called at system shutdown time to quiesce the device.\n\nThis means that some overlap exists between the two, because both have to\ntake care of properly shutting down the hardware. But currently the logic\nused in these two callbacks isn't consistent in msm drivers, which could\nlead to kernel panic.\n\nFor example, on .remove the component is deleted and its .unbind callback\nleads to the hardware being shutdown but only if the DRM device has been\nmarked as registered.\n\nThat check doesn't exist in the .shutdown logic and this can lead to the\ndriver calling drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() for a DRM device that hasn't\nbeen properly initialized.\n\nA situation like this can happen if drivers for expected sub-devices fail\nto probe, since the .bind callback will never be executed. If that is the\ncase, drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() will attempt to take mutexes that are\nonly initialized if drm_mode_config_init() is called during a device bind.\n\nThis bug was attempted to be fixed in commit 623f279c7781 (\"drm/msm: fix\nshutdown hook in case GPU components failed to bind\"), but unfortunately\nit still happens in some cases as the one mentioned above, i.e:\n\n  systemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.\n  kvm: exiting hardware virtualization\n  platform wifi-firmware.0: Removing from iommu group 12\n  platform video-firmware.0: Removing from iommu group 10\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 1 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_modeset_lock.c:317 drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx+0x3c4/0x3d0\n  ...\n  Hardware name: Google CoachZ (rev3+) (DT)\n  pstate: a0400009 (NzCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n  pc : drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx+0x3c4/0x3d0\n  lr : drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx+0x48/0x3d0\n  sp : ffff80000805bb80\n  x29: ffff80000805bb80 x28: ffff327c00128000 x27: 0000000000000000\n  x26: 0000000000000000 x25: 0000000000000001 x24: ffffc95d820ec030\n  x23: ffff327c00bbd090 x22: ffffc95d8215eca0 x21: ffff327c039c5800\n  x20: ffff327c039c5988 x19: ffff80000805bbe8 x18: 0000000000000034\n  x17: 000000040044ffff x16: ffffc95d80cac920 x15: 0000000000000000\n  x14: 0000000000000315 x13: 0000000000000315 x12: 0000000000000000\n  x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : 0000000000000000\n  x8 : ffff80000805bc28 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n  x5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : 0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000000000\n  x2 : ffff327c00128000 x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : ffff327c039c59b0\n  Call trace:\n   drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx+0x3c4/0x3d0\n   drm_atomic_helper_shutdown+0x70/0x134\n   msm_drv_shutdown+0x30/0x40\n   platform_shutdown+0x28/0x40\n   device_shutdown+0x148/0x350\n   kernel_power_off+0x38/0x80\n   __do_sys_reboot+0x288/0x2c0\n   __arm64_sys_reboot+0x28/0x34\n   invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114\n   el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x44/0xec\n   do_el0_svc+0x2c/0xc0\n   el0_svc+0x2c/0x84\n   el0t_64_sync_handler+0x11c/0x150\n   el0t_64_sync+0x18c/0x190\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000018\n  Mem abort info:\n    ESR = 0x0000000096000004\n    EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n    SET = 0, FnV = 0\n    EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n    FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\n  Data abort info:\n    ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004\n    CM = 0, WnR = 0\n  user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000010eab1000\n  [0000000000000018] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000\n  Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n  ...\n  Hardware name: Google CoachZ (rev3+) (DT)\n  pstate: a0400009 (NzCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n  pc : ww_mutex_lock+0x28/0x32c\n  lr : drm_modeset_lock_all_ctx+0x1b0/0x3d0\n  sp : ffff80000805bb50\n  x29: ffff80000805bb50 x28: ffff327c00128000 x27: 0000000000000000\n  x26: 00000\n---truncated---",

Hence the crash.\n\nA reproducer is:\n\n    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vdb\n    debugfs -w /dev/vdb -R \"set_inode_field \u003c8\u003e flags 0x80808\"\n    mount /dev/vdb /mnt -o inlinecrypt\n\nTo fix this, make ext4 consider journal inodes with the encrypt flag to\nbe invalid.  (Note, maybe other flags should be rejected on the journal\ninode too.  For now, this is just the minimal fix for the above issue.)\n\nI've marked this as fixing the commit that introduced the call to\nfscrypt_limit_io_blocks(), since that's what made an actual crash start\nbeing possible.  But this fix could be applied to any version of ext4\nthat supports the encrypt feature.",

The\n_rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() is used to compare the first n bytes of the two\nstrings from tail to head, which causes the problem. In the\n_rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit(), it was originally intended to meet\nthis requirement by carefully designing the comparison order.\nFor example, \"pregulation\" and \"pbandwidth\" are compared in order of\nlength from small to large, first is 3 and last is 4. However, the\ncomparison order of \"prate_section\" dose not obey such order requirement,\ntherefore when \"prate_section\" is \"HT\", when comparing from tail to head,\nit will lead to access out of bounds in _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte(). As\nmentioned above, the _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() has the same function as\nstrcmp(), so just strcmp() is enough.\n\nFix it by removing _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() and use strcmp() barely.\nAlthough it can be fixed by adjusting the comparison order of\n\"prate_section\", this may cause the value of \"rate_section\" to not be\nfrom 0 to 5. In addition, commit \"21e4b0726dc6\" not only moved driver\nfrom staging to regular tree, but also added setting txpower limit\nfunction during the driver config phase, so the problem was introduced\nby this commit.",

Devices were runtime suspended and in D3 prior\n  entering into suspend\n- Interrupt comes after pci_pm_resume_noirq() when device interrupts are\n  re-enabled\n- According to register dump the interrupt really comes from the\n  i2c_designware.0. Controller is enabled, I2C target address register\n  points to a one detectable I2C device address 0x60 and the\n  DW_IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register START_DET, STOP_DET, ACTIVITY and\n  TX_EMPTY bits are set indicating completed I2C transaction.\n\nMy guess is that the firmware uses this controller to communicate with\nan on-board I2C device during resume but does not disable the controller\nbefore giving control to an operating system.\n\nI was told the UEFI update fixes this but never the less it revealed the\ndriver is not ready to handle TX_EMPTY (or RX_FULL) interrupt when device\nis supposed to be idle and state variables are not set (especially the\ndev-\u003emsgs pointer which may point to NULL or stale old data).\n\nIntroduce a new software status flag STATUS_ACTIVE indicating when the\ncontroller is active in driver point of view.

Then it calls rdev_dec_pending(rdev, mddev)\n  and bio_put(bio).\n* so, the process that waited on sb_wait and that is woken up is racing\n  with bio_put(bio).\n* if the process wins the race, it calls bioset_exit before bio_put(bio)\n  is executed.\n* bio_put(bio) attempts to free a bio into a destroyed bio set - causing\n  a crash in mempool_free.\n\nWe fix this bug by moving bio_put before atomic_dec_and_test.\n\nWe also move rdev_dec_pending before atomic_dec_and_test as suggested by\nNeil Brown.\n\nThe function md_end_flush has a similar bug - we must call bio_put before\nwe decrement the number of in-progress bios.\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page\n PGD 11557f0067 P4D 11557f0067 PUD 0\n Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n CPU: 0 PID: 73 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 6.1.0-rc3 #5\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014\n Workqueue: kdelayd flush_expired_bios [dm_delay]\n RIP: 0010:mempool_free+0x47/0x80\n Code: 48 89 ef 5b 5d ff e0 f3 c3 48 89 f7 e8 32 45 3f 00 48 63 53 08 48 89 c6 3b 53 04 7d 2d 48 8b 43 10 8d 4a 01 48 89 df 89 4b 08 \u003c48\u003e 89 2c d0 e8 b0 45 3f 00 48 8d 7b 30 5b 5d 31 c9 ba 01 00 00 00\n RSP: 0018:ffff88910036bda8 EFLAGS: 00010093\n RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8891037b65d8 RCX: 0000000000000001\n RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000202 RDI: ffff8891037b65d8\n RBP: ffff8891447ba240 R08: 0000000000012908 R09: 00000000003d0900\n R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000173544 R12: ffff889101a14000\n R13: ffff8891562ac300 R14: ffff889102b41440 R15: ffffe8ffffa00d05\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88942fa00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000001102e99000 CR4: 00000000000006b0\n Call Trace:\n  \u003cTASK\u003e\n  clone_endio+0xf4/0x1c0 [dm_mod]\n  clone_endio+0xf4/0x1c0 [dm_mod]\n  __submit_bio+0x76/0x120\n  submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0xb6/0x2a0\n  flush_expired_bios+0x28/0x2f [dm_delay]\n  process_one_work+0x1b4/0x300\n  worker_thread+0x45/0x3e0\n  ? rescuer_thread+0x380/0x380\n  kthread+0xc2/0x100\n  ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20\n  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n  \u003c/TASK\u003e\n Modules linked in: brd dm_delay dm_raid dm_mod af_packet uvesafb cfbfillrect cfbimgblt cn cfbcopyarea fb font fbdev tun autofs4 binfmt_misc configfs ipv6 virtio_rng virtio_balloon rng_core virtio_net pcspkr net_failover failover qemu_fw_cfg button mousedev raid10 raid456 libcrc32c async_raid6_recov async_memcpy async_pq raid6_pq async_xor xor async_tx raid1 raid0 md_mod sd_mod t10_pi crc64_rocksoft crc64 virtio_scsi scsi_mod evdev psmouse bsg scsi_common [last unloaded: brd]\n CR2: 0000000000000000\n ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",

Otherwise, the replay code will\n  ignore them.  (BUG: ext4_fc_reserve_space() could violate this\n  requirement if called with a len of blocksize - 9 or blocksize - 8.\n  Fortunately, this doesn't seem to happen currently.)\n\n- tlvs must end at least 1 byte before the end of the block.  Otherwise\n  the replay code will consider them to be invalid.  This quirk\n  contributed to a bug (fixed by an earlier commit) where uninitialized\n  memory was being leaked to disk in the last byte of blocks.\n\nAlso, strangely these constraints don't apply to the replay code in\ne2fsprogs, which will accept any tlvs in the blocks (with no bounds\nchecks at all, but that is a separate issue...).\n\nGiven that this all seems to be a bug, let's fix it by just filling\nblocks with tlv entries in the natural way.\n\nNote that old kernels will be unable to replay fast-commit journals\ncreated by kernels that have this commit.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: fix zswap writeback race condition\n\nThe zswap writeback mechanism can cause a race condition resulting in\nmemory corruption, where a swapped out page gets swapped in with data that\nwas written to a different page.\n\nThe race unfolds like this:\n1. a page with data A and swap offset X is stored in zswap\n2. page A is removed off the LRU by zpool driver for writeback in\n   zswap-shrink work, data for A is mapped by zpool driver\n3. user space program faults and invalidates page entry A, offset X is\n   considered free\n4. kswapd stores page B at offset X in zswap (zswap could also be\n   full, if so, page B would then be IOed to X, then skip step 5.)\n5. entry A is replaced by B in tree-\u003erbroot, this doesn't affect the\n   local reference held by zswap-shrink work\n6. zswap-shrink work writes back A at X, and frees zswap entry A\n7. swapin of slot X brings A in memory instead of B\n\nThe fix:\nOnce the swap page cache has been allocated (case ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NEW),\nzswap-shrink work just checks that the local zswap_entry reference is\nstill the same as the one in the tree.  If it's not the same it means that\nit's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is\naborted because the local entry contains stale data.\n\nReproducer:\nI originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work\non the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test\nmachine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so\nwhatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do\nthe trick.\n\nIn order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of\navailable memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1\n--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens\nof minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging\n/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20\nand 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It's crucial to set\n`--vm-stride` to something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won't\nrealize that memory has been corrupted because all pages would have the\nsame data.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts\n\nHyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host\nsystem and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC\ndevice is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a\npartial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic\nportion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed\nin /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC\ndon't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't\npractical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.\n\nIn particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout\nfunction fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the\nrport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the\ncall from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this\nregard.\n\nIn many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation\ncan be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests\nissued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent\nfailure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,\nwhich again may be better.\n\nSo fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This\nallows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested\nby users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient\ntimeouts, and it solves their problem.\n\nIn the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc\nsince it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is\nworking well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer.",

This is a false positive and no circular locking\nactually occurs as no inodes exist yet when\nnilfs_sysfs_create_device_group() is called.  Fortunately, the lockdep\nwarnings can be resolved by simply moving the call to\nnilfs_sysfs_create_device_group() out of \"ns_sem\".\n\nThis fixes these sysfs issues by revising where the device's sysfs\ninterface is created/deleted and keeping its lifetime within the lifetime\nof the metadata files above.",

These stats are used in Byte Queue\nLimit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between these two stats tracks\nthe number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic\nincreases the number of queued bytes though calls to\nnetdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports\nthat it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the\nnumber of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue().\nIt is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and\nnum_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next\nbatch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.\n\nUnlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq\ntx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be\npartially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when\nre-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account\nfor the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch\nis sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase\nnum_completed to a value greater than the num_queued.

But that led\nto a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also\ncalled from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,\nwhich was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (\"scsi: core: Fix a procfs host\ndirectory removal regression\"). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call\nfrom dev_release().\n\nBut it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),\nand that function \"pairs\" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while\nscsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the\nreason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover\ncases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to\nscsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some\nerror paths, for example.\n\nSyzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on\nusb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see\nthat the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host\nallocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads\nto messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc\nstructure):\n\nusb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected\nproc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376\n\nThe proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),\nbut guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a\ncomment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is\nmeant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to\n{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.\n\nThis is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage\ndoes not trigger the warning anymore.",

When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use\n'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created\nor dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics\nof netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.\n'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.\nIf a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent\nabout this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the\nnewly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.\nIf 'qlen' reaches the configured sch-\u003elimit, the enqueue function stops\nworking, even though the tfifo is not full.\n\nReproduce the bug:\nEnsure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root\nqdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine\nas follows:\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms\n\nSend bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3\nclient on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:\n$ tc -s qdisc show dev \u003coif\u003e\n\nStatistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that\nnetem's backlog \u003e limit, netem stopped accepting packets):\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\nStatistics after the fix:\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\ntbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.\nThe interface fully stops transferring packets and \"locks\". In this case,\nthe child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at\nits limit and no more packets are accepted.\n\nThis patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is\nonly decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not\nduring enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus\naccounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As\nin other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in\nnetem and all of its children. As before, sch-\u003elimit remains as the\nmaximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's\nbacklog statistics.",

Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch-\u003elimit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '-\u003egraft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`.

The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report\n    error \"Bad rss-count\".\n\n 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio-\u003erefcount is zero,\n    then free_pages_prepare-\u003efree_page_is_bad() report error\n    \"Bad page state\".\n\nThere is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:\n\n  __replace_page()\n    -\u003e ...\n      -\u003e folio_remove_rmap_pte()\n        -\u003e VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)\n\nConsidering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just\nreject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().\n\n[ mingo: Cleaned up the changelog ]",

This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are\ntaken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our\nprocess and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to\nbe shared again before we actually perform the split.\n\nFix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from\n__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that\npoint, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.\n\nAn annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper\nhugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:\n\n1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:\n    - mmap lock (exclusively)\n    - VMA lock\n    - file rmap lock (exclusively)\n2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to\n   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently\n   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock\n\nBackporting note:\nThis commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit\nb30c14cd6102 (\"hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs\"); that\ncommit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually\nalso go all the way back.\n\n[jannh@google.com: v2]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Always pass notifications when child class becomes empty\n\nCertain classful qdiscs may invoke their classes' dequeue handler on an\nenqueue operation. This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus\nmake an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not\nexpect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the\nclass eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThe referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC\ncase by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to\nbe incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.\nThe following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:\n\n    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr\n    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole\n\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n\nSince backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale\nclass pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes\na different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch\nensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when\nthe child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of\nqdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or\nqdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing\nthe following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note\nthat this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This\nis not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the\nclassful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.",

When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,\nthe operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),\nthe function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes\nwhen the driver later accesses the freed memory.\n\nThis results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto\ndriver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel\ncrashes with NULL pointer dereferences.\n\nThe issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't\nguarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in\nthe mask, async implementations can be selected.\n\nFix by restoring the async crypto handling:\n- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking\n- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification\n- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion\n\nThis ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation\ncompletes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the\nCVE-2024-50047 fix.",

Considered\ntoo specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would\nbe a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future\nDOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].\n\n2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a\nper cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its\nchild, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a\nnetem.\n\n3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb\nto handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement\nin duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal\nnotes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this\nsafeguard.\n\n4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral\npath contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a\npacket to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem\nduplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a\nduplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/8DuRWwfqjoRDLDmBMlIfbrsZg9Gx50DHJc1ilxsEBNe2D6NMoigR_eIRIG0LOjMc3r10nUUZtArXx4oZBIdUfZQrwjcQhdinnMis_0G7VEk=@willsroot.io/\n[2] https://lwn.net/Articles/719297/",

Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not\nhonor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that.\n\nThis problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states\nthat for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state\n(with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence\nconnections handled by the respective function break, and for future\nconnection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a\ndysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as\nwell.\n\nA kernel message like\n[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a\nis a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state\nwith PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like\n[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery\nis a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered\nbecause the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.\n\nOn a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to\nthe FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU\ntrying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that\nthis can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to\nPEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the\nfailure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command\nand executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs\nas if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not\nthe other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about\nproviding an exhaustive list of possible consequences.",

If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer\npointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.\n\nThis behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without\n'commit 6f18d174b73d (\"bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer\nis written\")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before\nupdating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to\naccess the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the\nchance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an\nevent pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed\none, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all\nof the TREs in between the two read pointers.\n\nThis commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the\nevent points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.\n\n[mani: added stable tag and reworded commit message]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling\n\nThe issue originates when Strongswan initiates an XFRM_MSG_ALLOCSPI\nNetlink message, which triggers the kernel function xfrm_alloc_spi().\nThis function is expected to ensure uniqueness of the Security Parameter\nIndex (SPI) for inbound Security Associations (SAs). However, it can\nreturn success even when the requested SPI is already in use, leading\nto duplicate SPIs assigned to multiple inbound SAs, differentiated\nonly by their destination addresses.\n\nThis behavior causes inconsistencies during SPI lookups for inbound packets.\nSince the lookup may return an arbitrary SA among those with the same SPI,\npacket processing can fail, resulting in packet drops.\n\nAccording to RFC 4301 section 4.4.2 , for inbound processing a unicast SA\nis uniquely identified by the SPI and optionally protocol.\n\nReproducing the Issue Reliably:\nTo consistently reproduce the problem, restrict the available SPI range in\ncharon.conf : spi_min = 0x10000000 spi_max = 0x10000002\nThis limits the system to only 2 usable SPI values.\nNext, create more than 2 Child SA. each using unique pair of src/dst address.\nAs soon as the 3rd Child SA is initiated, it will be assigned a duplicate\nSPI, since the SPI pool is already exhausted.\nWith a narrow SPI range, the issue is consistently reproducible.\nWith a broader/default range, it becomes rare and unpredictable.\n\nCurrent implementation:\nxfrm_spi_hash() lookup function computes hash using daddr, proto, and family.\nSo if two SAs have the same SPI but different destination addresses, then\nthey will:\na. Hash into different buckets\nb. Be stored in different linked lists (byspi + h)\nc. Not be seen in the same hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() iteration.\nAs a result, the lookup will result in NULL and kernel allows that Duplicate SPI\n\nProposed Change:\nxfrm_state_lookup_spi_proto() does a truly global search - across all states,\nregardless of hash bucket and matches SPI and proto.",

While Docker should automatically recreate these rules, versions before 28.3.3 fail to recreate the specific rules that block external access to containers. This means that after a firewalld reload, containers with ports published to localhost (like 127.0.0.1:8080) become accessible from remote machines that have network routing to the Docker bridge, even though they should only be accessible from the host itself. The vulnerability only affects explicitly published ports - unpublished ports remain protected. This issue is fixed in version 28.3.3.",
