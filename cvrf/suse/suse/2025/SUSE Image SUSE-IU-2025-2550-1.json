      "Text": "This image update for google/sle-hpc-15-sp7-byos-v20250920-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Upgrade to release 9.20.11  Security Fixes:\n  * Fix a possible assertion failure when\n    stale-answer-client-timeout is set to 0. In specific\n    circumstances the named resolver process could exit with an\n    assertion failure when stale answers were enabled and the\n    stale-answer-client-timeout configuration option was set to 0.\n    (CVE-2025-40777)\n    [bsc#1246548]\n  New Features:\n  * Add support for the CO flag to dig.\n  * Implement a new notify-defer configuration option. This new\n    option sets a delay (in seconds) to wait before sending a set\n    of NOTIFY messages for a zone. Whenever a NOTIFY message is\n    ready to be sent, sending is deferred for this duration. This\n    option should not be confused with the notify-delay option. The\n    default is 0 seconds.\n  Removed Features:\n  * Implement the systemd notification protocol manually to remove\n    dependency on libsystemd.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  * Correct the default interface-interval from 60s to 60m.\n  * Fix a purge-keys bug when using multiple views of a zone.\n  * Use IPv6 queries in delv +ns.\n  * A secondary zone could initiate a new zone transfer from the\n    primary server after it had been already deleted from the\n    secondary server, and before the internal garbage collection\n    was activated to clean it up completely. This has been fixed.\n  * A secondary zone could fail to further refresh with new\n    versions of the zone from a primary server if named was\n    reconfigured during the SOA request step of an ongoing zone\n    transfer. This has been fixed.\n- Clean up systemd BuildRequires\n\nPackage boost was updated:\n\n- CVE-2016-9840: fixed out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in zlib in beast  (bsc#1245936)\n  - adds patch boost-zlib.patch\n\nPackage cifs-utils was updated:\n\n- Add patches:  * 0001-cifs.upcall-correctly-treat-UPTARGET_UNSPECIFIED-as-.patch\n  (bsc#1243488)\n  * 0001-mount.cifs-retry-mount-on-EINPROGRESS.patch\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update version to 10.5.2 (bsc#1247539)  + When an instance fails verification server side the default credentials\n    were left behind requireing manual intervantion prior to the next\n    registration attempt.\n  + Fix issue triggered when using instance-billing-flavor-check due to\n    IP address handling as object rather than string introduced 10.5.0\n\n- Update version to 10.5.1\n  + Fix issue with picking up configured server names from the\n    regionsrv config file. Previously only IP addresses were collected\n  + Update scriptlet for package uninstall to avoid issues in the\n    build service\n\n- Update version to 10.5.0\n  + Use region server IP addresses to determine Internet access rather\n    than a generic address. Region server IP addresses may not be blocked\n    in the network construct. (bsc#1245305)\n\nPackage coreutils was updated:\n\n- coreutils-9.7-sort-CVE-2025-5278.patch: Add upstream patch:  sort with key character offsets of SIZE_MAX, could induce\n  a read of 1 byte before an allocated heap buffer.\n  (CVE-2025-5278, bsc#1243767)\n\nPackage crypto-policies was updated:\n\n- Update the BSI policy [jsc#PED-12880]  * BSI: switch to 3072 minimum RSA key size [322f0ba4]\n  * BSI: Update BSI policy for new 2024 minimum [64b9dddd]\n  * Add patches:\n  -

PED-12534\n  When this patchset was first added in 2013 (and rewritten over the years),\n  there was no upstream way to easily provide SLE customers with a way to build\n  container images based on SLE using the host subscription. However, with\n  docker-buildx you can now define secrets for builds (this is not entirely\n  transparent, but we can easily document this new requirement for SLE-16).\n  Users should use\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n  when doing their builds.\n- Now that the only blocker for docker-buildx support was removed for SLE-16,\n  enable docker-buildx for SLE-16 as well.

As result of TAA vulnerability\n  (CVE-2019-11135) we have aimed to follow the upstream default for TSX\n  but due to a mistake we have ended up using CONFIG_X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_ON\n  rather than CONFIG_X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_OFF. This has been noticed later\n  on and fixed to align with upstream. Which has made some users unhappy\n  because they have lost a default TSX functionality even on HW that is\n  not susceptible to CVE-2019-11135.\n  We have discussed different ways to deal with that but the likely most\n  straightforward turned out to be to go with CONFIG_X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_AUTO\n  which disables TSX only on CVE-2019-11135 affected HW. We are still\n  diverging from the upstream here but there are some positive indications\n  that no new TSX based side channels have been discovered since.\n- commit 395c9dd\n\n- kABI fix after KVM:

resulting symbol CRCs with the reference data. If the values\n  differ, it then invokes 'ksymtypes compare' to provide a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols differ. The build expects the latter\n  'ksymtypes compare' command to always return zero, even if the two\n  compared kABI corpuses are different.\n  This is currently the case for 'ksymtypes compare'. However, I plan to\n  update the command to return a non-zero code when the comparison detects\n  any differences. This should ensure consistent behavior with 'ksymvers\n  compare'.\n  Since the build uses 'ksymtypes compare' only for more detailed\n  diagnostics, ignore its return code.\n- commit 5ac1381\n\n-

During this operation, genksyms\n  is invoked for each source file. The tool determines type signatures of\n  all exports within the file, reports any differences compared to the\n  associated symref reference, calculates symbol CRCs from the signatures\n  and writes new type data into a symtypes file.\n  * The script rpm/modversions is invoked again, this time it packs all new\n  symtypes files to a consolidated kABI file.\n  * The downstream script rpm/kabi.pl checks symbol CRCs in the new build and\n  compares them to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking\n  kabi/severities into account.\n  suse-kabi-tools is a new set of tools to improve the kABI checking process.\n  The suite includes two tools, ksymtypes and ksymvers, which replace the\n  existing scripts rpm/modversions and rpm/kabi.pl, as well as the comparison\n  functionality previously provided by genksyms. The tools have their own\n  source repository and package.\n  The tools provide faster operation and more detailed, unified output. In\n  addition, they allow the use of the new upstream tool gendwarfksyms, which\n  lacks any built-in comparison functionality.\n  The updated workflow is as follows:\n  * The build performs a regular kernel make. During this operation, genksyms\n  (gendwarfksyms) is invoked as usual, determinining signatures and CRCs of\n  all exports and writing the type data to symtypes files. However,\n  genksyms no longer performs any comparison.\n  * 'ksymtypes consolidate' packs all new symtypes files to a consolidated\n  kABI file.\n  * 'ksymvers compare' checks symbol CRCs in the new build and compares them\n  to a reference from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symvers-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt;, taking kabi/severities\n  into account. The tool writes its result in a human-readable form on\n  standard output and also writes a list of all changed exports (not\n  ignored by kabi/severities) to the changed-exports file.\n  * 'ksymtypes compare' takes the changed-exports file, the consolidated kABI\n  symtypes reference data from kabi/\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;/symtypes-\u0026lt;flavor\u0026gt; and the new\n  consolidated data. Based on this data, it produces a detailed report\n  explaining why the symbols changed.\n  The patch enables the use of suse-kabi-tools via rpm/config.sh, providing\n  explicit control to each branch. To enable the support, set\n  USE_SUSE_KABI_TOOLS=Yes in the config file.\n- commit a2c6f89\n\n- rpm/kernel-source.changes.old: Drop bogus bugzilla reference (bsc#1244725)\n- commit 5432961\n\n-

When connecting to a malicious server, it could\n    cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. On many\n    systems this is harmless as unused virtual memory is only\n    a mapping, but if this hit a virtual address size limit\n    it could lead to a MemoryError or other process crash. On\n    unusual systems or builds where all allocated memory is\n    touched and backed by actual ram or storage it couldâve\n    consumed resources doing so until similarly crashing.\n  - gh-127257: In ssl, system call failures that OpenSSL reports\n    using ERR_LIB_SYS are now raised as OSError.\n  - gh-121277: Writers of CPythonâs documentation can now use\n    next as the version for the versionchanged, versionadded,\n    deprecated directives.\n  - gh-106883: Disable GC during the _PyThread_CurrentFrames()\n    and _PyThread_CurrentExceptions() calls to avoid the\n    interpreter to deadlock.\n- Remove upstreamed patch:\n  - CVE-2025-0938-sq-brackets-domain-names.patch\n- Add gh-126572-test_ssl-no-stop-ThreadedEchoServer-OSError.patch\n  which makes test_ssl not to stop ThreadedEchoServer on OSError,\n  which makes test_ssl pass with OpenSSL 3.5 (bsc#1241067,\n  gh#python/cpython!126572)\n\nPackage python3 was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2025-8194-tarfile-no-neg-offsets.patch which now  validates archives to ensure member offsets are non-negative\n  (gh#python/cpython#130577, CVE-2025-8194, bsc#1247249).\n\n- Add CVE-2025-4435-normalize-lnk-trgts-tarfile.patch\n  Security fixes for CVE-2025-4517, CVE-2025-4330, CVE-2025-4138,\n  CVE-2024-12718, CVE-2025-4435 on tarfile (bsc#1244032,\n  bsc#1244061, bsc#1244059, bsc#1244060, bsc#1244056).\n  The backported fixes do not contain changes for ntpath.py and\n  related tests, because the support for symlinks and junctions\n  were added later in Python 3.9, and it does not make sense to\n  backport them to 3.6 here.\n  The patch is contains the following changes:\n  - python@42deeab fixes symlink handling for tarfile.data_filter\n  - python@9d2c2a8 fixes handling of existing files/symlinks in tarfile\n  - python@00af979 adds a new \u0026quot;strict\u0026quot; argument to realpath()\n  - python@dd8f187 fixes mulriple CVE fixes in the tarfile module\n  - downstream only fixes that makes the changes work and\n    compatible with Python 3.6\n- Add CVE-2025-6069-quad-complex-HTMLParser.patch to avoid worst\n  case quadratic complexity when processing certain crafted\n  malformed inputs with HTMLParser (CVE-2025-6069, bsc#1244705).\n\n- Add python36-* provides/obsoletes to enable SLE-12 -\u0026gt; SLE-15\n  migration, bsc#1233012\n\n- Add ipaddress-update-pr60.patch from gh#phihag/ipaddress!60 to\n  update vendored ipaddress module to 3.8 equivalent\n- Add gh-128840_parse-IPv6-with-emb-IPv4.patch to limit buffer\n  size for IPv6 address parsing (gh#python/cpython#128840,\n  bsc#1244401).\n- Update CVE-2025-4516-DecodeError-handler.patch not to break\n  _PyBytes_DecodeEscape signature.\n\n- Add CVE-2025-4516-DecodeError-handler.patch fixing\n  CVE-2025-4516 (bsc#1243273) blocking DecodeError handling\n  vulnerability, which could lead to DoS.\n\nPackage libsolv was updated:\n\n- add support for product-obsoletes() provides in the product  autopackage generation code\n- bump version to 0.7.34\n\n- improve transaction ordering by allowing more uninst-\u0026gt;uninst\n  edges [bsc#1243457]\n- implement color filtering when adding update targets\n- support orderwithrequires dependencies in susedata.xml\n- bump version to 0.7.33\n\nPackage sqlite3 was updated:\n\n- Backpatch the URLs in sqlite3.n from https to http to avoid a  file conflict with the tcl package on SLE-15-GA up to SP2.

So injecting an\n    Obsoletes: product:oldproductname \u0026lt; oldproductversion\n  into the -release package to indicate a product rename is no longer\n  possible.\n  Since libsolv-0.7.34 you can and should use:\n    Provides: product-obsoletes(oldproductname) \u0026lt; oldproductversion\n  in the -release package. libsolv will then inject the appropriate\n  Obsoletes into the Product.\n- version 17.37.10 (35)\n\n- Ignore DeltaRpm download errors (bsc#1245672)\n  DeltaRpms are in fact optional resources. In case of a failure\n  the full rpm is downloaded.\n- Improve fix for incorrect filesize handling (bsc#1245220)\n- version 17.37.9 (35)\n\n- Do not trigger download data exceeded errors on HTTP non data\n  responses (bsc#1245220)\n  In some cases a HTTP 401 or 407 did trigger a \u0026quot;filesize exceeded\u0026quot;\n  error, because the response payload size was compared against the\n  expected filesize. This patch adds some checks if the response\n  code is in the success range and only then takes expected\n  filesize into account. Otherwise the response content-length is\n  used or a fallback of 2Mb if no content-length is known.\n- version 17.37.8 (35)\n\n- Fix SEGV in MediaDISK handler (bsc#1245452)\n- Explicitly selecting DownloadAsNeeded also selects the\n  classic_rpmtrans backend.\n  DownloadAsNeeded can not be combined with the rpm singletrans\n  installer backend because a rpm transaction requires all package\n  headers to be available the the beginning of the transaction. So\n  explicitly selecting this mode also turns on the classic_rpmtrans\n  backend.\n- Fix evaluation of libproxy results (bsc#1244710)\n- version 17.37.7 (35)\n\n- Enhancements regarding mirror handling during repo refresh.\n  Added  means to disable the use of mirrors when downloading\n  security relevant files. Requires updaing zypper to 1.14.91.\n- Fix autotestcase writer if ZYPP_FULLLOG=1 (bsc#1244042)\n  If ZYPP_FULLLOG=1 a solver testcase to\n  \u0026quot;/var/log/YaST2/autoTestcase\u0026quot; should be written for each solver\n  run. There was no testcase written for the very first solver run.\n  This is now fixed.\n- Pass $1==2 to %posttrans script if it's an update (bsc#1243279)\n- version 17.37.6 (35)\n\nPackage mdadm was

Note that sock_release() is synchronous\nbut fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.\n\nThe delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed\nbut handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()\nfollowed by closing the file actually does call the -\u003ehp_destroy\nmethod. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the\nfinal close is complete before it checks the pointer.\n\nWe cannot use a completion here because if -\u003ehp_destroy is never\ncalled (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.\n\nReported by: Guenter Roeck \u003clinux@roeck-us.net\u003e",

      "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.",

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list\nof such helpers.\n\nAt the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing\nhelper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when\nprocessing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to\nhelpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in\nthe caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not\nrejected by verifier.\n\nThis commit fixes the omission by computing field\nbpf_subprog_info-\u003echanges_pkt_data for each sub-program before main\nverification pass.\nchanges_pkt_data should be set if:\n- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data\n  returns true;\n- subprogram calls a global function,\n  for which bpf_subprog_info-\u003echanges_pkt_data should be set.\n\nThe verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this\ninformation. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal\ndone by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:\n- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a\n  state when S is fully explored;\n- when S is fully explored:\n  - every direct helper call within S is explored\n    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);\n  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully\n    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).\n\nThe downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not\ntaken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead\nbecause of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume\nthat the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data\ncomputation.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop\n\nMove the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value\nout of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware\nwith a stale vcpu-\u003earch.dr6.\n\nWhen the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,\nKVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on\nVM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs\nat will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint\nonly generates one VM-Exit.\n\nFor DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also\nidentical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)\nand KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading\nDR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.\n\nBut for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for\nKVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas\nVMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the\nguest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done\n_inside_ the core run loop.\n\nUnfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common\nx86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in\nhardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is\na fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu-\u003earch.dr6 and\nclobber the guest's actual value.\n\nThe bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX\npreemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6\nbeing modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is\norders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the\nVMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection\nand the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the\nwindow where hardware DR6 is \"dirty\" extends all the way from L1 writing\nDR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).\n\n    L1's view:\n    ==========\n    \u003cL1 disables DR interception\u003e\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640961: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n A:  L1 Writes DR6\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640963: \u003chack\u003e: Set DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff1\n\n B:        CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640967: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT intr_info 0x800000ec\n\n D: L1 reads DR6, arch.dr6 = 0\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640969: \u003chack\u003e: Sync DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640976: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n    L2 reads DR6, L1 disables DR interception\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640980: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640983: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640983: \u003chack\u003e: Set DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n    L2 detects failure\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640987: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason HLT\n    L1 reads DR6 (confirms failure)\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640990: \u003chack\u003e: Sync DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n    L0's view:\n    ==========\n    L2 reads DR6, arch.dr6 = 0\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005610: kvm_exit: vcpu 23 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] .....  3410.005610: kvm_nested_vmexit: vcpu 23 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n\n    L2 =\u003e L1 nested VM-Exit\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] .....  3410.005610: kvm_nested_vmexit_inject: reason: DR_ACCESS ext_inf1: 0x0000000000000216\n\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005610: kvm_entry: vcpu 23\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005611: kvm_exit: vcpu 23 reason VMREAD\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005611: kvm_entry: vcpu 23\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.\n---truncated---",

Instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which\nwould cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the\nmissed TD which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.\n\nThis buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged\nsince the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first\nand foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but\nby the spec I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.\n\nAfter d56b0b2ab142, TDs are immediately skipped when handling those\nStopped events. This poses a potential problem in case of Stopped -\nLength Invalid, which occurs either on completed TDs (likely already\ngiven back) or Link and No-Op TRBs. Such event won't be recognized\nas matching any TD (unless it's the rare Link TRB inside a TD) and\nwill result in skipping all pending TDs, giving them back possibly\nbefore they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe UAF by HW.\n\nAs a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this\nkind of event. Then the next event will skip missed TDs. A downside\nof not handling Stopped - Length Invalid on a Link inside a TD is\nthat if the TD is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated\nto account for TRBs (silently) completed before the TD was stopped.\n\nI had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there\nis no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. It may be\na very rare, obscure condition. The sole motivation for this patch\nis that if such unlikely event does occur, I'd rather risk reporting\na cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with UAF.\n\nThis will be fixed more properly by looking at Stopped event's TRB\npointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely\nto be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years.",

This issue can be reproduced if puting a\n'mdelay(10)' after 'mutex_unlock(\u0026trace_types_lock)' in s_start(),\nand executing the following script:\n\n  $ echo function_graph \u003e current_tracer\n  $ cat trace \u003e /dev/null \u0026\n  $ sleep 5  # Ensure the 'cat' reaches the 'mdelay(10)' point\n  $ echo timerlat \u003e current_tracer\n\nThe root cause lies in the two calls to print_graph_function_flags\nwithin print_trace_line during each s_show():\n\n  * One through 'iter-\u003etrace-\u003eprint_line()';\n  * Another through 'event-\u003efuncs-\u003etrace()', which is hidden in\n    print_trace_fmt() before print_trace_line returns.\n\nTracer switching only updates the former, while the latter continues\nto use the print_line function of the old tracer, which in the script\nabove is print_graph_function_flags.\n\nMoreover, when switching from the 'function_graph' tracer to the\n'timerlat' tracer, s_start only calls graph_trace_close of the\n'function_graph' tracer to free 'iter-\u003eprivate', but does not set\nit to NULL.

Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:\n\nThis fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is\ncalled more than once and calls after the first call do not find any\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:\n\nvhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);\n...\n\nkfree(vs-\u003evs_tpg);\nvs-\u003evs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found\nmatch=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the\npointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:\n\nkfree(vs-\u003evs_tpg);\nvs-\u003evs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf a scsi request is then sent we do:\n\nvhost_scsi_handle_vq -\u003e vhost_scsi_get_req -\u003e vhost_vq_get_backend\n\nwhich sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.\n\n2. Tpg dir removal hang:\n\nThis patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer\ntpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount\ndropping to -1.\n\nThe problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already\nin the vs-\u003evs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so\ntarget_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their\nrefcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added\nin the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in\nprevious calls which are also in vs-\u003evs_tpg.\n\nLater, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs-\u003evs_tpg which will drop\ntheir refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg\nand will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.\n\n3. Tpg leak:\n\nThis fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be\nun-removable because the target name is overwritten when\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different\ntarget names.\n\nThe bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup\na vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls\nVHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we\nhaven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this\nhappens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite\nthe target name and the vs-\u003evs_tpg array. Later when we do\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's\nname and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the\nvs-\u003evs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing\ntarget_undepend_item on the tpgs.\n\nBecause of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major\nuser, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the\nissues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called\nif it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the\ntpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint\nfirst.",

As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy.

      "Description": "OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva attack, exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign API, and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics\n\nDriver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and\nstandalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",

The reference count is 0, so the\n  dma_buf is destroyed, which in turn decrements the corresponding\n  amdgpu_bo reference count to 0, and the amdgpu_bo is destroyed -\n  calling drm_gem_object_release then dma_resv_fini (which destroys the\n  reservation object), then finally freeing the amdgpu_bo.\n\n- nouveau_bo obj-\u003ebo.base.resv is now a dangling pointer to the memory\n  formerly allocated to the amdgpu_bo.\n\n- nouveau_gem_object_del calls ttm_bo_put(\u0026nvbo-\u003ebo) which calls\n  ttm_bo_release, which schedules ttm_bo_delayed_delete.\n\n- ttm_bo_delayed_delete runs and dereferences the dangling resv pointer,\n  resulting in a general protection fault.\n\nFix this by moving the drm_prime_gem_destroy call from\nnouveau_gem_object_del to nouveau_bo_del_ttm. This ensures that it will\nbe run after ttm_bo_delayed_delete.",

If that happens, the entire tree setup is\nin limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing\n(doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's\ndst-\u003eports, and maybe dst-\u003ertable), and switch N failed to probe, ending\nthe tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.\n\nIf switch N fails to probe, its memory (ports) will be freed and removed\nfrom dst-\u003eports. However, the dst-\u003ertable elements pointing to its ports,\nas created by dsa_link_touch(), will remain there, and will lead to\nuse-after-free if dereferenced.\n\nIf dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, which is entirely\npossible because that is where ds-\u003eops-\u003esetup() is, we get a kasan\nreport like this:\n\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mv88e6xxx_setup_upstream_port+0x240/0x568\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff000004f56020 by task kworker/u8:3/42\n\nCall trace:\n __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x20/0x30\n mv88e6xxx_setup_upstream_port+0x240/0x568\n mv88e6xxx_setup+0xebc/0x1eb0\n dsa_register_switch+0x1af4/0x2ae0\n mv88e6xxx_register_switch+0x1b8/0x2a8\n mv88e6xxx_probe+0xc4c/0xf60\n mdio_probe+0x78/0xb8\n really_probe+0x2b8/0x5a8\n __driver_probe_device+0x164/0x298\n driver_probe_device+0x78/0x258\n __device_attach_driver+0x274/0x350\n\nAllocated by task 42:\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x84/0xa0\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x298/0x490\n dsa_switch_touch_ports+0x174/0x3d8\n dsa_register_switch+0x800/0x2ae0\n mv88e6xxx_register_switch+0x1b8/0x2a8\n mv88e6xxx_probe+0xc4c/0xf60\n mdio_probe+0x78/0xb8\n really_probe+0x2b8/0x5a8\n __driver_probe_device+0x164/0x298\n driver_probe_device+0x78/0x258\n __device_attach_driver+0x274/0x350\n\nFreed by task 42:\n __kasan_slab_free+0x48/0x68\n kfree+0x138/0x418\n dsa_register_switch+0x2694/0x2ae0\n mv88e6xxx_register_switch+0x1b8/0x2a8\n mv88e6xxx_probe+0xc4c/0xf60\n mdio_probe+0x78/0xb8\n really_probe+0x2b8/0x5a8\n __driver_probe_device+0x164/0x298\n driver_probe_device+0x78/0x258\n __device_attach_driver+0x274/0x350\n\nThe simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its\nentirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating\nit even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N,\nbecause dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already\nexists in dst-\u003ertable, allocating if not.\n\nThe deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in\ndsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be\ncalled from the tree setup error path.\n\nIn my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added\ndsa_link elements to dst-\u003ertable. Prior to that, each switch had its own\nds-\u003ertable which is freed when the switch fails to probe. But the tree\nis potentially persistent memory.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for all usages of TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT\n\nThis requirement was overeagerly loosened in commit 2f83e38a095f\n(\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without CAP_SYS_ADMIN\"), but as\nit turns out,\n\n  (1) the logic I implemented there was inconsistent (apologies!),\n\n  (2) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT might actually be a small security risk\n      after all, and\n\n  (3) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only meant to be used by the mouse\n      daemon (GPM or Consolation), which runs as CAP_SYS_ADMIN\n      already.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1. The previous patch has inconsistent logic:\n\n   In commit 2f83e38a095f (\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes\n   without CAP_SYS_ADMIN\"), we checked for sel_mode ==\n   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of\n   this \"mode\" parameter were actually used as an additional way to\n   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require\n   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not\n   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.\n\n   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have\n   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the\n   value of the \"hidden\" mouse button argument.\n\n   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with\n   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/\n\n2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can\n   let an attacker simulate \"keyboard\" input to command line\n   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other\n   TIOCLINUX \"selection mode\" IOCTLs.\n\n   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse\n   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate\n   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI\n   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with\n   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.\n\n   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to\n   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because\n   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The\n   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,\n   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes\n   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.\n\n   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/\n\n   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it\n   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 (\"tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be\n   disabled\")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with\n   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would\n   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for\n   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before\n   commit 2f83e38a095f (\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without\n   CAP_SYS_ADMIN\").\n\n3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or\n   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:\n\n   To quote console_codes(4):\n\n     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return\n     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console\n     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these\n     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the\n     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These\n     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application\n     such as the gpm(8) daemon.\n\n   Jared Finder has also confirmed in\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/\n   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it\n   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that\n   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.\n\n   More information on the interaction between GPM, terminals and th\n---truncated---",

However, this change also causes\nthe kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the\ninterrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped\nIRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.",

Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass\noperations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().\n\nAlthough in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,\nwe made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address\nfilters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,\nand setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the\nfact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as\nkernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick\nhack.\n\nIt seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim\n.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP\nin order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from\nrunning, although we could do that.\n\nAccepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.\nEspecially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different\nangle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even\nfor VLANs:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\n\nWhat happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,\nthen the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.\n\nThis is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an\ninformational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see\nthat bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'\nexperience, to justify the logic.",

The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put()\nnot exit early:\n\n\tif (!sid)\n\t\treturn 0;\n\nAnd the answer seems to be simple: the sid comes from vlan.sid which\nsupposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get().\nBut some chip-\u003einfo-\u003eops-\u003evtu_getnext() implementations do not populate\nvlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case,\nlater in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a garbage sid which is\njust residual stack memory.\n\nTesting for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge\nVLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and\ninstalled by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the\nSTU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI,\nso although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to\nzero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the\ncoincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to\nthe same (correct) behavior.\n\nAnother option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for\nmv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one\nwhich already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means\nthe caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access\nuninitialized memory, which is not nice even if it ignores it later.\n\nSo we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the\nsid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure\nfields which might get temporarily accessed.",

With perfect timing it looks possible that\nthe pages we pulled from the hmm fault can get sniped by\nmigrate_pages_batch() at the same time that we are holding the notifier\nlock to mark the pages as accessed/dirty, but at this point we also want\nto grab the folio locks(s) to mark them as dirty, but if they are\ncontended from notifier/migrate_pages_batch side then we deadlock since\nfolio lock won't be dropped until we drop the notifier lock.\n\nFortunately the mark_page_accessed/dirty is not really needed in the\nfirst place it seems and should have already been done by hmm fault, so\njust remove it.\n\n(cherry picked from commit bd7c0cb695e87c0e43247be8196b4919edbe0e85)",

This is because it incorrectly\nforwards the return value of hci_devcd_init() (which returns 0 on\nsuccess). As a result, the caller (btusb_recv_acl_qca() or\nbtusb_recv_evt_qca()) assumes the packet was not handled and passes it\nto hci_recv_frame(), leading to premature kfree() of the skb.\n\nLater, hci_devcd_rx() attempts to dequeue the same skb from the dump\nqueue, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFix this by:\n1. Making handle_dump_pkt_qca() return 0 on success and negative errno\n   on failure, consistent with kernel conventions.\n2. Splitting dump packet detection into separate functions for ACL\n   and event packets for better structure and readability.\n\nThis ensures dump packets are properly identified and consumed, avoiding\ndouble handling and preventing NULL pointer access.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize\n\nWhen running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started\nseeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info-\u003esectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb-\u003estart turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb-\u003estart 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info-\u003esectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb-\u003estart 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info-\u003esectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 \u003e\u003e 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix\nit simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.",

Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in\nrunning the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use\nPEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply\nlooking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host\nuserspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.\n\nRunning the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as\ncrashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't\nwritten MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when\ntrying to record PEBS events.\n\nThe issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before\ncommit 7b100989b4f6 (\"perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default\") (after\nwhich, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).\tThe userspace side\nof perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs()\nmisconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.\n\nArguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events\nsimply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there\nis no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad\nuserspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to\nguest-owned events.\n\nNote, commit 854250329c02 (\"KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily\nin two rare situations\") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling\nKVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only\nKVM.",

The above methods should be optional.\n\nFor type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -\u003e phylink_stop(),\nand dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -\u003e phylink_start().\nThese seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because\nthat is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the\nbiggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.\n\nTalking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which\ndo not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),\nI have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is\ntriggered:\n\n\tWARN_ON(phydev-\u003estate != PHY_HALTED \u0026\u0026 phydev-\u003estate != PHY_READY \u0026\u0026\n\t\tphydev-\u003estate != PHY_UP);\n\nbecause the PHY state machine is running.\n\nIt's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -\u003e ... -\u003e\nphylink_start() -\u003e phy_start() having been initiated by the user.\n\nThe previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called\nphy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state\nPHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.\n\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for\nphylink, the phydev-\u003eadjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a\ntechnicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (\"phylib: fix PAL state\nmachine restart on resume\"). That commit was written before phylink\nexisted, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which\ndon't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.\nBut phylink itself has historically not been developed with\nsuspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that\nscenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior\nto the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.\n\nThis issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to\nthe above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC\ndriver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where\nthe issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a\nquick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:\n\n$ grep -Zlr PHYLINK_NETDEV drivers/ | xargs -0 grep -L mac_managed_pm\ndrivers/net/ethernet/atheros/ag71xx.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/sparx5/sparx5_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan966x/lan966x_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa2/dpaa2-mac.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fs_enet/fs_enet-main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa/dpaa_eth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/ucc_geth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/enetc/enetc_pf_common.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/prestera/prestera_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mediatek/mtk_eth_soc.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/altera/altera_tse_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/wangxun/txgbe/txgbe_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/meta/fbnic/fbnic_phylink.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/tehuti/tn40_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot_net.c\n\nMake the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a\nphydev-\u003ephy_link_change() implementation equal to the default\nphy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that\nthe phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and\nwhen phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/\nstarted on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that\nif phydev-\u003ephy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the\nkernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.\n\nThus, for the situation where the PM is not managed b\n---truncated---",

This\ncan leave an empty HFSC class in the active list, causing further\nconsequences like use-after-free.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug by moving the increment of sch-\u003eq.qlen and\nsch-\u003eqstats.backlog before the call to the child qdisc's peek() operation.\nThis ensures that queue length and backlog are always accurate when packet\ndrops or dequeues are triggered during the peek.",

However, there is no locking\nat the irq layer that helps protect the lifetime. Today, this works under\nthe assumption that the iommu domain is not changed while MSI interrupts\nbeing programmed. This is true for normal DMA API users within the kernel,\nas the iommu domain is attached before the driver is probed and cannot be\nchanged while a driver is attached.\n\nClassic VFIO type1 also prevented changing the iommu domain while VFIO was\nrunning as it does not support changing the \"container\" after starting up.\n\nHowever, iommufd has improved this so that the iommu domain can be changed\nduring VFIO operation. This potentially allows userspace to directly race\nVFIO_DEVICE_ATTACH_IOMMUFD_PT (which calls iommu_attach_group()) and\nVFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS (which calls into iommu_dma_compose_msi_msg()).\n\nThis potentially causes both the cookie pointer and the unlocked call to\niommu_get_domain_for_dev() on the MSI translation path to become UAFs.\n\nFix the MSI cookie UAF by removing the cookie pointer. The translated IOVA\naddress is already known during iommu_dma_prepare_msi() and cannot change.\nThus, it can simply be stored as an integer in the MSI descriptor.\n\nThe other UAF related to iommu_get_domain_for_dev() will be addressed in\npatch \"iommu: Make iommu_dma_prepare_msi() into a generic operation\" by\nusing the IOMMU group mutex.",

Otherwise, the\nnetns may not be reachable anymore (if all processes within the ns\nhave terminated), so we cannot delete the xfrm state to drop its\nreference on the socket.\n\nThis patch results in a small (~2% in my tests) performance\nregression.\n\nA GC-type mechanism could be added for the socket cache, to clear\nreferences if the state hasn't been used \"recently\", but it's a lot\nmore complex than just not caching the socket.",

In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up\nresources which were allocated during fork().\n\nio_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up\nin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the\ncurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,\ntss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThere are two issues, which lead to that problem:\n\n  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when\n     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a\n     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().\n\n  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap\n     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.\n\n     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of\n     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread\n     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.\n\n     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because\n     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and\n     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().\n\nCure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:\n\n  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if\n     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.\n\n  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user\n     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in\n     io_bitmap_share().\n\nFor paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch\nthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.",

When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers.

But some\npackets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't\nknow how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires\ntouching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for\nother types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the\nbasic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.\n\nIf only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will\nalways cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed\ncall stack information, see below.\n\nValid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs\n- consist of two or more segments\n- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size\n- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment\n- all but the last must be gso_size\n\nOptional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can\nmodify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.\n\nIn extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,\nthis  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were\npulled tail to become (12,10,10) bytes.\n\nThe skbs no longer meets the above SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST conditions because\npayload was pulled into head_skb, it needs to be linearized before pass\nto regular skb_segment.\n\n    skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    __udp_gso_segment+0x334/0x5f4\n    udp4_ufo_fragment+0x118/0x15c\n    inet_gso_segment+0x164/0x338\n    skb_mac_gso_segment+0xc4/0x13c\n    __skb_gso_segment+0xc4/0x124\n    validate_xmit_skb+0x9c/0x2c0\n    validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x80\n    sch_direct_xmit+0x70/0x404\n    __dev_queue_xmit+0x64c/0xe5c\n    neigh_resolve_output+0x178/0x1c4\n    ip_finish_output2+0x37c/0x47c\n    __ip_finish_output+0x194/0x240\n    ip_finish_output+0x20/0xf4\n    ip_output+0x100/0x1a0\n    NF_HOOK+0xc4/0x16c\n    ip_forward+0x314/0x32c\n    ip_rcv+0x90/0x118\n    __netif_receive_skb+0x74/0x124\n    process_backlog+0xe8/0x1a4\n    __napi_poll+0x5c/0x1f8\n    net_rx_action+0x154/0x314\n    handle_softirqs+0x154/0x4b8\n\n    [118.376811] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:bug\u0026]kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4278!\n    [118.376829] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:traps\u0026]Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n    [118.470774] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]Kernel Offset: 0x178cc00000 from 0xffffffc008000000\n    [118.470810] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]PHYS_OFFSET: 0x40000000\n    [118.470827] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO)\n    [118.470848] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]pc : [0xffffffd79598aefc] skb_segment+0xcd0/0xd14\n    [118.470900] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]lr : [0xffffffd79598a5e8] skb_segment+0x3bc/0xd14\n    [118.470928] [C201134] rxq0_pus: [name:mrdump\u0026]sp : ffffffc008013770",

However, during rollback, msg-\u003emsg_iter is reset, but since\nmsg_pl-\u003esg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the\nactual size of msg_iter.\n'''\niov_iter_revert(\u0026msg-\u003emsg_iter, msg_pl-\u003esg.size - orig_size);\n'''\n\nThe changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:\n\n1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is\npointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.\n\n2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.\n\nAssume the original data is \"abcdefgh\" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes\nby the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: \"abc?de?fgh?\".\nThen, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been\nprocessed, and the remaining 5 bytes \"?fgh?\" will be cached until the\nlength meets the cork_bytes requirement.\n\nHowever, some data in \"?fgh?\" is not within 'sg-\u003emsg_iter'\n(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data \"?\" we pushed.\n\nSo it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of\nmsg_iter.\n\n3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a \"cork\" situation occurs,\nthe user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is\nthe same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.\n\nAdditionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling\ncorking is written as:\n'''\nline 1177\nelse if (ret != -EAGAIN) {\n\tif (ret == -ENOSPC)\n\t\tret = 0;\n\tgoto send_end;\n'''\n\nSo it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a \"cork\" situation\noccurs.",

The references are removed either\nupon completion of iw_cm event handlers or when the application destroys\nthe cm_id. This commit introduced the use-after-free condition where\ncm_id_private object could still be in use by event handler works during\nthe destruction of cm_id. The commit aee2424246f9 (\"RDMA/iwcm: Fix a\nuse-after-free related to destroying CM IDs\") addressed this use-after-\nfree by flushing all pending works at the cm_id destruction.\n\nHowever, still another use-after-free possibility remained. It happens\nwith the work objects allocated for each cm_id_priv within\nalloc_work_entries() during cm_id creation, and subsequently freed in\ndealloc_work_entries() once all references to the cm_id are removed.\nIf the cm_id's last reference is decremented in the event handler work,\nthe work object for the work itself gets removed, and causes the use-\nafter-free BUG below:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff88811f9cf800 by task kworker/u16:1/147091\n\n  CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 147091 Comm: kworker/u16:1 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc2+ #27 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-3.fc41 04/01/2014\n  Workqueue:  0x0 (iw_cm_wq)\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x90\n   print_report+0x174/0x554\n   ? __virt_addr_valid+0x208/0x430\n   ? __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   kasan_report+0xae/0x170\n   ? __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   __pwq_activate_work+0x1ff/0x250\n   pwq_dec_nr_in_flight+0x8c5/0xfb0\n   process_one_work+0xc11/0x1460\n   ? __pfx_process_one_work+0x10/0x10\n   ? assign_work+0x16c/0x240\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0xb0\n   ? _raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x24/0x50\n   ? rcu_is_watching+0x11/0xb0\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  Allocated by task 147416:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_save_track+0x10/0x30\n   __kasan_kmalloc+0xa6/0xb0\n   alloc_work_entries+0xa9/0x260 [iw_cm]\n   iw_cm_connect+0x23/0x4a0 [iw_cm]\n   rdma_connect_locked+0xbfd/0x1920 [rdma_cm]\n   nvme_rdma_cm_handler+0x8e5/0x1b60 [nvme_rdma]\n   cma_cm_event_handler+0xae/0x320 [rdma_cm]\n   cma_work_handler+0x106/0x1b0 [rdma_cm]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\n  Freed by task 147091:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_save_track+0x10/0x30\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x37/0x60\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x4b/0x70\n   kfree+0x13a/0x4b0\n   dealloc_work_entries+0x125/0x1f0 [iw_cm]\n   iwcm_deref_id+0x6f/0xa0 [iw_cm]\n   cm_work_handler+0x136/0x1ba0 [iw_cm]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\n  Last potentially related work creation:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x2c/0x50\n   kasan_record_aux_stack+0xa3/0xb0\n   __queue_work+0x2ff/0x1390\n   queue_work_on+0x67/0xc0\n   cm_event_handler+0x46a/0x820 [iw_cm]\n   siw_cm_upcall+0x330/0x650 [siw]\n   siw_cm_work_handler+0x6b9/0x2b20 [siw]\n   process_one_work+0x84f/0x1460\n   worker_thread+0x5ef/0xfd0\n   kthread+0x3b0/0x770\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nThis BUG is reproducible by repeating the blktests test case nvme/061\nfor the rdma transport and the siw driver.\n\nTo avoid the use-after-free of cm_id_private work objects, ensure that\nthe last reference to the cm_id is decremented not in the event handler\nworks, but in the cm_id destruction context.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.\n\nJann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().\n\nThe following sequences reproduce the issue:\n\n  $ python3\n  from socket import *\n  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)\n  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)\n\nEven though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on\nthe recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().\n\nAfter the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has\n2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.\n\nThen, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB\n\n  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb\n  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb\n  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb\n  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb\n\n, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.\n\nThe 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not\nexpect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\n  while (skip \u003e= unix_skb_len(skb)) {\n    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);\n    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, \u0026sk-\u003esk_receive_queue);\n    ...\n  }\n\nIn addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that\nioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\nSo, nothing good comes out of such a situation.\n\nInstead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next\nECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,\nlet's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.\n\nNow, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its\nprevious skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in unix_stream_read_actor (net/unix/af_unix.c:3027)\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff888106ef2904 by task python3/315\n\nCPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 315 Comm: python3 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-00407-gec315832f6f9 #8 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-4.fc42 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:122)\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:409 mm/kasan/report.c:521)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:636)\n unix_stream_read_actor (net/unix/af_unix.c:3027)\n unix_stream_read_generic (net/unix/af_unix.c:2708 net/unix/af_unix.c:2847)\n unix_stream_recvmsg (net/unix/af_unix.c:3048)\n sock_recvmsg (net/socket.c:1063 (discriminator 20) net/socket.c:1085 (discriminator 20))\n __sys_recvfrom (net/socket.c:2278)\n __x64_sys_recvfrom (net/socket.c:2291 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:2287 (discriminator 1) net/socket.c:2287 (discriminator 1))\n do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 (discriminator 1))\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)\nRIP: 0033:0x7f8911fcea06\nCode: 5d e8 41 8b 93 08 03 00 00 59 5e 48 83 f8 fc 75 19 83 e2 39 83 fa 08 75 11 e8 26 ff ff ff 66 0f 1f 44 00 00 48 8b 45 10 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 8b 5d f8 c9 c3 0f 1f 40 00 f3 0f 1e fa 55 48 89 e5 48 83 ec 08\nRSP: 002b:00007fffdb0dccb0 EFLAGS: 00000202 ORIG_RAX: 000000000000002d\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fffdb0dcdc8 RCX: 00007f8911fcea06\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: 00007f8911a5e060 RDI: 0000000000000006\nRBP: 00007fffdb0dccd0 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000202 R12: 00007f89119a7d20\nR13: ffffffffc4653600 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 315:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:60 (discriminator 1) mm/kasan/common.c:69 (discriminator 1))\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:348)\n kmem_cache_alloc_\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack\n---truncated---",

[0]\n\nFrom the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while\nits device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.\n\nOnce the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls\nhci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct\nvhci_data, which is set to hci_dev-\u003edev-\u003edriver_data.\n\nThe problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking\nhdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be\nanother thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before\nthe unlink operation.\n\nWe can use SRCU for such synchronisation.\n\nLet's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion\nin hci_unregister_dev().\n\nAnother option would be to restore hci_dev-\u003edestruct(), which was\nremoved in commit 587ae086f6e4 (\"Bluetooth: Remove unused\nhci-destruct cb\").  However, this would not be a good solution, as\nwe should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight\nioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.\n\nNote that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,\nvirtbt_remove().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88807cb8d858 by task syz.1.219/6718\n\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6718 Comm: syz.1.219 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-syzkaller-00196-g08207f42d3ff #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl+0x189/0x250 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:408 [inline]\n print_report+0xd2/0x2b0 mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report+0x118/0x150 mm/kasan/report.c:634\n skb_queue_empty_lockless include/linux/skbuff.h:1891 [inline]\n skb_queue_purge_reason+0x99/0x360 net/core/skbuff.c:3937\n skb_queue_purge include/linux/skbuff.h:3368 [inline]\n vhci_flush+0x44/0x50 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:69\n hci_dev_do_reset net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:552 [inline]\n hci_dev_reset+0x420/0x5c0 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:592\n sock_do_ioctl+0xd9/0x300 net/socket.c:1190\n sock_ioctl+0x576/0x790 net/socket.c:1311\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xf9/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:893\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7fcf5b98e929\nCode: ff ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 a8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007fcf5c7b9038 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007fcf5bbb6160 RCX: 00007fcf5b98e929\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000400448cb RDI: 0000000000000009\nRBP: 00007fcf5ba10b39 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007fcf5bbb6160 R15: 00007ffd6353d528\n \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 6535:\n kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n kasan_save_track+0x3e/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n poison_kmalloc_redzone mm/kasan/common.c:377 [inline]\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x93/0xb0 mm/kasan/common.c:394\n kasan_kmalloc include/linux/kasan.h:260 [inline]\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x230/0x3d0 mm/slub.c:4359\n kmalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:905 [inline]\n kzalloc_noprof include/linux/slab.h:1039 [inline]\n vhci_open+0x57/0x360 drivers/bluetooth/hci_vhci.c:635\n misc_open+0x2bc/0x330 drivers/char/misc.c:161\n chrdev_open+0x4c9/0x5e0 fs/char_dev.c:414\n do_dentry_open+0xdf0/0x1970 fs/open.c:964\n vfs_open+0x3b/0x340 fs/open.c:1094\n do_open fs/namei.c:3887 [inline]\n path_openat+0x2ee5/0x3830 fs/name\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/sgx: Prevent attempts to reclaim poisoned pages\n\nTL;DR: SGX page reclaim touches the page to copy its contents to\nsecondary storage. SGX instructions do not gracefully handle machine\nchecks. Despite this, the existing SGX code will try to reclaim pages\nthat it _knows_ are poisoned. Avoid even trying to reclaim poisoned pages.\n\nThe longer story:\n\nPages used by an enclave only get epc_page-\u003epoison set in\narch_memory_failure() but they currently stay on sgx_active_page_list until\nsgx_encl_release(), with the SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED flag untouched.\n\nepc_page-\u003epoison is not checked in the reclaimer logic meaning that, if other\nconditions are met, an attempt will be made to reclaim an EPC page that was\npoisoned.  This is bad because 1. we don't want that page to end up added\nto another enclave and 2. it is likely to cause one core to shut down\nand the kernel to panic.\n\nSpecifically, reclaiming uses microcode operations including \"EWB\" which\naccesses the EPC page contents to encrypt and write them out to non-SGX\nmemory.  Those operations cannot handle MCEs in their accesses other than\nby putting the executing core into a special shutdown state (affecting\nboth threads with HT.)  The kernel will subsequently panic on the\nremaining cores seeing the core didn't enter MCE handler(s) in time.\n\nCall sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() to remove the affected EPC page from\nsgx_active_page_list on memory error to stop it being considered for\nreclaiming.\n\nTesting epc_page-\u003epoison in sgx_reclaim_pages() would also work but I assume\nit's better to add code in the less likely paths.\n\nThe affected EPC page is not added to \u0026node-\u003esgx_poison_page_list until\nlater in sgx_encl_release()-\u003esgx_free_epc_page() when it is EREMOVEd.\nMembership on other lists doesn't change to avoid changing any of the\nlists' semantics except for sgx_active_page_list.  There's a \"TBD\" comment\nin arch_memory_failure() about pre-emptive actions, the goal here is not\nto address everything that it may imply.\n\nThis also doesn't completely close the time window when a memory error\nnotification will be fatal (for a not previously poisoned EPC page) --\nthe MCE can happen after sgx_reclaim_pages() has selected its candidates\nor even *inside* a microcode operation (actually easy to trigger due to\nthe amount of time spent in them.)\n\nThe spinlock in sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() is safe because\nmemory_failure() runs in process context and no spinlocks are held,\nexplicitly noted in a mm/memory-failure.c comment.",

That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThat pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the\ncode in question will delay the actual call to \"ep_free(ep)\" until after\nit has unlocked the mutex.\n\nBut it's wrong for the much subtler \"next to last\" case when somebody\n*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're\nstill using the mutex.\n\nNote that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep\nmutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,\neven if they guarantee mutual exclusion.\n\nA mutex \"unlock\" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still\naccessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in\nand get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the\nfirst user is still cleaning up.\n\nSee our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,\nin particular the section [1] about semantics:\n\n\t\"mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has\n\t internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for\n\t another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the\n\t mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore\"\n\nSo if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the\nlast one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops\n_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all\nwhile the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.\n\nFix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:\nthe refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's\nthe whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently\nabout object lifetimes).",

This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus\nmake an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not\nexpect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the\nclass eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.\n\nThe referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC\ncase by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to\nbe incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.\nThe following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:\n\n    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr\n    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1\n    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem\n    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole\n\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1\n    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888\n\nSince backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale\nclass pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes\na different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch\nensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when\nthe child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of\nqdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or\nqdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing\nthe following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note\nthat this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This\nis not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the\nclassful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix a race between renames and directory logging\n\nWe have a race between a rename and directory inode logging that if it\nhappens and we crash/power fail before the rename completes, the next time\nthe filesystem is mounted, the log replay code will end up deleting the\nfile that was being renamed.\n\nThis is best explained following a step by step analysis of an interleaving\nof steps that lead into this situation.\n\nConsider the initial conditions:\n\n1) We are at transaction N;\n\n2) We have directories A and B created in a past transaction (\u003c N);\n\n3) We have inode X corresponding to a file that has 2 hardlinks, one in\n   directory A and the other in directory B, so we'll name them as\n   \"A/foo_link1\" and \"B/foo_link2\". Both hard links were persisted in a\n   past transaction (\u003c N);\n\n4) We have inode Y corresponding to a file that as a single hard link and\n   is located in directory A, we'll name it as \"A/bar\". This file was also\n   persisted in a past transaction (\u003c N).\n\nThe steps leading to a file loss are the following and for all of them we\nare under transaction N:\n\n 1) Link \"A/foo_link1\" is removed, so inode's X last_unlink_trans field\n    is updated to N, through btrfs_unlink() -\u003e btrfs_record_unlink_dir();\n\n 2) Task A starts a rename for inode Y, with the goal of renaming from\n    \"A/bar\" to \"A/baz\", so we enter btrfs_rename();\n\n 3) Task A inserts the new BTRFS_INODE_REF_KEY for inode Y by calling\n    btrfs_insert_inode_ref();\n\n 4) Because the rename happens in the same directory, we don't set the\n    last_unlink_trans field of directoty A's inode to the current\n    transaction id, that is, we don't cal btrfs_record_unlink_dir();\n\n 5) Task A then removes the entries from directory A (BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY\n    and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items) when calling __btrfs_unlink_inode()\n    (actually the dir index item is added as a delayed item, but the\n    effect is the same);\n\n 6) Now before task A adds the new entry \"A/baz\" to directory A by\n    calling btrfs_add_link(), another task, task B is logging inode X;\n\n 7) Task B starts a fsync of inode X and after logging inode X, at\n    btrfs_log_inode_parent() it calls btrfs_log_all_parents(), since\n    inode X has a last_unlink_trans value of N, set at in step 1;\n\n 8) At btrfs_log_all_parents() we search for all parent directories of\n    inode X using the commit root, so we find directories A and B and log\n    them. Bu when logging direct A, we don't have a dir index item for\n    inode Y anymore, neither the old name \"A/bar\" nor for the new name\n    \"A/baz\" since the rename has deleted the old name but has not yet\n    inserted the new name - task A hasn't called yet btrfs_add_link() to\n    do that.\n\n    Note that logging directory A doesn't fallback to a transaction\n    commit because its last_unlink_trans has a lower value than the\n    current transaction's id (see step 4);\n\n 9) Task B finishes logging directories A and B and gets back to\n    btrfs_sync_file() where it calls btrfs_sync_log() to persist the log\n    tree;\n\n10) Task B successfully persisted the log tree, btrfs_sync_log() completed\n    with success, and a power failure happened.\n\n    We have a log tree without any directory entry for inode Y, so the\n    log replay code deletes the entry for inode Y, name \"A/bar\", from the\n    subvolume tree since it doesn't exist in the log tree and the log\n    tree is authorative for its index (we logged a BTRFS_DIR_LOG_INDEX_KEY\n    item that covers the index range for the dentry that corresponds to\n    \"A/bar\").\n\n    Since there's no other hard link for inode Y and the log replay code\n    deletes the name \"A/bar\", the file is lost.\n\nThe issue wouldn't happen if task B synced the log only after task A\ncalled btrfs_log_new_name(), which would update the log with the new name\nfor inode Y (\"A/bar\").\n\nFix this by pinning the log root during renames before removing the old\ndirectory entry, and unpinning af\n---truncated---",

The loop bound `t-\u003ecount` is modified within the loop, which can\n   cause the loop to terminate early and miss some entries.\n\n2. When removing an entry from the neighbour array, the subsequent entries\n   are moved up to fill the gap, but the loop index `i` is still\n   incremented, causing the next entry to be skipped.\n\nFor example, if a node has three neighbours (A, A, B) with count=3 and A\nis being removed, the second A is not checked.\n\n    i=0: (A, A, B) -\u003e (A, B) with count=2\n          ^ checked\n    i=1: (A, B)    -\u003e (A, B) with count=2\n             ^ checked (B, not A!)\n    i=2: (doesn't occur because i \u003c count is false)\n\nThis leaves the second A in the array with count=2, but the rose_neigh\nstructure has been freed. Code that accesses these entries assumes that\nthe first `count` entries are valid pointers, causing a use-after-free\nwhen it accesses the dangling pointer.\n\nFix both issues by iterating over the array in reverse order with a fixed\nloop bound. This ensures that all entries are examined and that the removal\nof an entry doesn't affect subsequent iterations.",

Further debugging has allowed to narrow that scope down to\nDRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2, and ring_context_alloc(), specific to ring\nsubmission, in particular.\n\nIf successful then that function, or its execlists or GuC submission\nequivalent, is supposed to be called only once per GEM context engine,\nfollowed by raise of a flag that prevents the function from being called\nagain.  The function is expected to unwind its internal errors itself, so\nit may be safely called once more after it returns an error.\n\nIn case of ring submission, the function first gets a reference to the\nengine's legacy timeline and then allocates a VMA.  If the VMA allocation\nfails, e.g. when i915_vma_instance() called from inside is interrupted\nwith a signal, then ring_context_alloc() fails, leaving the timeline held\nreferenced.  On next I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2 IOCTL, another reference to the\ntimeline is got, and only that last one is put on successful completion.\nAs a consequence, the legacy timeline, with its underlying engine status\npage's VMA object, is still held and not released on driver unbind.\n\nGet the legacy timeline only after successful allocation of the context\nengine's VMA.\n\nv2: Add a note on other submission methods (Krzysztof Karas):\n    Both execlists and GuC submission use lrc_alloc() which seems free\n    from a similar issue.\n\n(cherry picked from commit cc43422b3cc79eacff4c5a8ba0d224688ca9dd4f)",

The framebuffer memory\nrange stored in screen_info refers to the CPU addresses as seen during\nboot (where the offset is 0). During boot up, firmware may assign a\ndifferent memory offset to the PCI host bridge and thereby relocating\nthe framebuffer address of the PCI graphics device as seen by the kernel.\nThe information in screen_info must be updated as well.\n\nThe helper pcibios_bus_to_resource() performs the relocation of the\nscreen_info's framebuffer resource (given in PCI bus addresses). The\nresult matches the I/O-memory resource of the PCI graphics device (given\nin CPU addresses). As before, we store away the information necessary to\nlater update the information in screen_info itself.\n\nCommit 78aa89d1dfba (\"firmware/sysfb: Update screen_info for relocated\nEFI framebuffers\") added the code for updating screen_info. It is based\non similar functionality that pre-existed in efifb.

However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/d912cbd7-193b-4269-9857-525bee8bbb6a@gmail.com/",

However, the code\nthat checks for available space in the skb is flawed:\n'''\ncopy = size_goal - skb-\u003elen\n'''\n\nThe types of the variables involved are:\n'''\ncopy: ssize_t (s64 on 64-bit systems)\nsize_goal: int\nskb-\u003elen: unsigned int\n'''\n\nDue to C's type promotion rules, the signed size_goal is converted to an\nunsigned int to match skb-\u003elen before the subtraction. The result is an\nunsigned int.\n\nWhen this unsigned int result is then assigned to the s64 copy variable,\nit is zero-extended, preserving its non-negative value. Consequently, copy\nis always \u003e= 0.\n\nAssume we are sending 2GB of data and size_goal has been adjusted to a\nvalue smaller than skb-\u003elen. The subtraction will result in copy holding a\nvery large positive integer. In the subsequent logic, this large value is\nused to update sk-\u003esk_forward_alloc, which can easily cause it to overflow.\n\nThe syzkaller reproducer uses TCP_REPAIR to reliably create this\ncondition. However, this can also occur in real-world scenarios. The\ntcp_bound_to_half_wnd() function can also reduce size_goal to a small\nvalue. This would cause the subsequent tcp_wmem_schedule() to set\nsk-\u003esk_forward_alloc to a value close to INT_MAX. Further memory\nallocation requests would then cause sk_forward_alloc to wrap around and\nbecome negative.\n\n[1]: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=de6565462ab540f50e47",

There are a couple of\nproblems with the above scheme.\n\nThe first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled while the device is running:\n\n # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0\n # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off\n # ip link del dev bond1\n\nWhen the device is put administratively down the \"rx-vlan-filter\"\nfeature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the\nmemory will be leaked [1].\n\nAnother problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically\ndelete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not\nadding it when the device was put administratively up since during that\ntime the \"rx-vlan-filter\" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or\nbug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount\nimbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:\n\n$ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0\n$ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off\n$ ifconfig bond0 up\n$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on\n$ ifconfig bond0 down\n$ ip link del vlan0\n\nRoot cause is as below:\nstep1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team.\nregister_vlan_dev\n    vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1\nstep2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev\nstep3: change filter from 0 to 1\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_filter_push_vids\n        ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0\nstep4: real_dev down\nvlan_device_event\n    vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0\n        vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0\nstep5: delete vlan0\nunregister_vlan_dev\n    BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null\n\nFix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was\nautomatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it\nshould be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the\n\"rx-vlan-filter\" feature.\n\n[1]\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880068e3100 (size 256):\n  comm \"ip\", pid 384, jiffies 4296130254\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 20 30 0d 80 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  . 0.............\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace (crc 81ce31fa):\n    __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x2b5/0x340\n    vlan_vid_add+0x434/0x940\n    vlan_device_event.cold+0x75/0xa8\n    notifier_call_chain+0xca/0x150\n    __dev_notify_flags+0xe3/0x250\n    rtnl_configure_link+0x193/0x260\n    rtnl_newlink_create+0x383/0x8e0\n    __rtnl_newlink+0x22c/0xa40\n    rtnl_newlink+0x627/0xb00\n    rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x6fb/0xb70\n    netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x350\n    netlink_unicast+0x426/0x710\n    netlink_sendmsg+0x75a/0xc20\n    __sock_sendmsg+0xc1/0x150\n    ____sys_sendmsg+0x5aa/0x7b0\n    ___sys_sendmsg+0xfc/0x180\n\n[2]\nkernel BUG at net/8021q/vlan.c:99!\nOops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 382 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.16.0-rc3 #61 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),\nBIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:unregister_vlan_dev (net/8021q/vlan.c:99 (discriminator 1))\nRSP: 0018:ffff88810badf310 EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88810da84000 RCX: ffffffffb47ceb9a\nRDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: ffff88810e8b43c8\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: fffffbfff6cefe80\nR10: ffffffffb677f407 R11: ffff88810badf3c0 R12: ffff88810e8b4000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffff88810642a5c0 R15: 000000000000017e\nFS:  00007f1ff68c20c0(0000) GS:ffff888163a24000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f1ff5dad240 CR3: 0000000107e56000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\n---truncated---",

[2][3]\n\nAt that time, an ugly hack was suggested [4], but it makes both INET\nand SMC code error-prone and hard to change.\n\nAlso, yet another variant was fixed by a hacky commit 98d4435efcbf3\n(\"net/smc: prevent NULL pointer dereference in txopt_get\").\n\nInstead of papering over the root cause by such hacks, we should not\nallow non-INET socket to reuse the INET infra.\n\nLet's add inet_sock as the first member of smc_sock.\n\n[0]:\nkvfree_call_rcu(): Double-freed call. rcu_head 000000006921da73\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 6718 at mm/slab_common.c:1956 kvfree_call_rcu+0x94/0x3f0 mm/slab_common.c:1955\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6718 Comm: syz.0.17 Tainted: G        W           6.16.0-rc4-syzkaller-g7482bb149b9f #0 PREEMPT\nTainted: [W]=WARN\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\npstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\npc : kvfree_call_rcu+0x94/0x3f0 mm/slab_common.c:1955\nlr : kvfree_call_rcu+0x94/0x3f0 mm/slab_common.c:1955\nsp : ffff8000a03a7730\nx29: ffff8000a03a7730 x28: 00000000fffffff5 x27: 1fffe000184823d3\nx26: dfff800000000000 x25: ffff0000c2411e9e x24: ffff0000dd88da00\nx23: ffff8000891ac9a0 x22: 00000000ffffffea x21: ffff8000891ac9a0\nx20: ffff8000891ac9a0 x19: ffff80008afc2480 x18: 00000000ffffffff\nx17: 0000000000000000 x16: ffff80008ae642c8 x15: ffff700011ede14c\nx14: 1ffff00011ede14c x13: 0000000000000004 x12: ffffffffffffffff\nx11: ffff700011ede14c x10: 0000000000ff0100 x9 : 5fa3c1ffaf0ff000\nx8 : 5fa3c1ffaf0ff000 x7 : 0000000000000001 x6 : 0000000000000001\nx5 : ffff8000a03a7078 x4 : ffff80008f766c20 x3 : ffff80008054d360\nx2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : 0000000000000201 x0 : 0000000000000000\nCall trace:\n kvfree_call_rcu+0x94/0x3f0 mm/slab_common.c:1955 (P)\n cipso_v4_sock_setattr+0x2f0/0x3f4 net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c:1914\n netlbl_sock_setattr+0x240/0x334 net/netlabel/netlabel_kapi.c:1000\n smack_netlbl_add+0xa8/0x158 security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2581\n smack_inode_setsecurity+0x378/0x430 security/smack/smack_lsm.c:2912\n security_inode_setsecurity+0x118/0x3c0 security/security.c:2706\n __vfs_setxattr_noperm+0x174/0x5c4 fs/xattr.c:251\n __vfs_setxattr_locked+0x1ec/0x218 fs/xattr.c:295\n vfs_setxattr+0x158/0x2ac fs/xattr.c:321\n do_setxattr fs/xattr.c:636 [inline]\n file_setxattr+0x1b8/0x294 fs/xattr.c:646\n path_setxattrat+0x2ac/0x320 fs/xattr.c:711\n __do_sys_fsetxattr fs/xattr.c:761 [inline]\n __se_sys_fsetxattr fs/xattr.c:758 [inline]\n __arm64_sys_fsetxattr+0xc0/0xdc fs/xattr.c:758\n __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:35 [inline]\n invoke_syscall+0x98/0x2b8 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49\n el0_svc_common+0x130/0x23c arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:132\n do_el0_svc+0x48/0x58 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:151\n el0_svc+0x58/0x180 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:879\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0x84/0x12c arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:898\n el0t_64_sync+0x198/0x19c arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:600\n\n[\n---truncated---",

That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction\nhandler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first\n`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction\nhandlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.

In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or\n`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the\n`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.\n\nFor `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the\nsupplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at\nleast exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in\n\"comedi_fops.c\" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are\nallocated.  However, if `insn-\u003en` is 0 (which is allowable for\n`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain\nuninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a\ndifferent instruction in the array of instructions handled by\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being\nwritten to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output\nchannel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the\ninternal saved state of the channel.\n\nFix it by returning 0 early if `insn-\u003en` is 0, before reaching the code\nthat accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on\nsuccess, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually\nread or written up to `insn-\u003en`, which is 0 in this case.",

      "Description": "There is a defect in the CPython \"tarfile\" module affecting the \"TarFile\" extraction and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process tar archives with negative offsets without error, resulting in an infinite loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously crafted tar archives. \n\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by including the following patch after importing the \"tarfile\" module:   https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/1716ac5b82b73dbcbf23ad2eff8b33e1",

      "Description": "1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target` \n 2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same \n   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set \n 3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path=\\\"/\\\",`).\n   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.\n4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.",
