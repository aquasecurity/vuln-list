bsc#1234214 / bsc#1234245.\n  These three bugs all have the same root cause:\n  Package 'xxd' has been obsoleted by Vim, as it provides the xxd\n  files directly.\n  However, because the \u0026quot;Obsoletes\u0026quot; entry was versioned, depending on\n  which version of 'xxd' that is installed, the \u0026quot;Obsoletes\u0026quot; isn't\n  actually triggered. Thus, there is a conflict between \u0026quot;vim\u0026quot; and\n  \u0026quot;xxd\u0026quot; in these cases.\n  Fixing this by removing the version completely. The 'vim' package\n  should always replace 'xxd', even if people are migrating from an\n  older SLE15 service pack which has the exact same version.\n\nPackage wget was updated:\n\n- If wget for an http URL is redirected to a different site (hostname  parts of URLs differ), then any \u0026quot;Authenticate\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Cookie\u0026quot; header\n  entries are discarded.\n  [bsc#1185551, wget-do-not-propagate-credentials.patch,\n  bsc#1230795, CVE-2021-31879]\n\nPackage xorg-x11-server was updated:\n\n- U_CVE-2025-26594-0001-Cursor-Refuse-to-free-the-root-cursor.patch  U_CVE-2025-26594-0002-dix-keep-a-ref-to-the-rootCursor.patch\n  * Use-after-free of the root cursor (CVE-2025-26594, bsc#1237427)\n- U_CVE-2025-26595-0001-xkb-Fix-buffer-overflow-in-XkbVModMaskText.patch\n  * Buffer overflow in XkbVModMaskText() (CVE-2025-26595, bsc#1237429)\n- U_CVE-2025-26596-0001-xkb-Fix-computation-of-XkbSizeKeySyms.patch\n  * Heap overflow in XkbWriteKeySyms() (CVE-2025-26596, bsc#1237430)\n- U_CVE-2025-26597-0001-xkb-Fix-buffer-overflow-in-XkbChangeTypesOfKey.patch\n  * Buffer overflow in XkbChangeTypesOfKey() (CVE-2025-26597, bsc#1237431)\n- U_CVE-2025-26598-0001-Xi-Fix-barrier-device-search.patch\n  * Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient() (CVE-2025-26598, bsc#1237432)\n- U_CVE-2025-26599-0001-composite-Handle-failure-to-redirect-in-compRedirect.patch\n  U_CVE-2025-26599-0002-composite-initialize-border-clip-even-when-pixmap-al.patch\n  * Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow() (CVE-2025-26599, bsc#1237433)\n- U_CVE-2025-26600-0001-dix-Dequeue-pending-events-on-frozen-device-on-remov.patch\n  * Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents() (CVE-2025-26600, bsc#1237434)\n- U_CVE-2025-26601-0001-sync-Do-not-let-sync-objects-uninitialized.patch\n  U_CVE-2025-26601-0002-sync-Check-values-before-applying-changes.patch\n  U_CVE-2025-26601-0003-sync-Do-not-fail-SyncAddTriggerToSyncObject.patch\n  U_CVE-2025-26601-0004-sync-Apply-changes-last-in-SyncChangeAlarmAttributes.patch\n  * Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger() (CVE-2025-26601, bsc#1237435)\n\nPackage xrdp was updated:\n\n- Enforce no login screen if require_credentials is set  (bsc#1227769)\n  + Add xrdp-CVE-2024-39917.patch\n  + Rebase xrdp-fate318398-change-expired-password.patch\n\nPackage zypper was updated:\n\n- Annonunce --root in commands not launching a Target  (bsc#1237044)\n- BuildRequires:  libzypp-devel \u0026gt;= 17.36.3.\n- version 1.14.85\n\n- Let zypper dup fail in case of (temporarily) unaccessible repos\n  (bsc#1228434, bsc#1236939, fixes #446)\n- version 1.14.84\n\n- New system-architecture command (bsc#1236384)\n  Prints the detected system architecture.\n- version 1.14.83\n\n- requires: libzypp \u0026gt;= 17.36.0.\n- Change versioncmp command to return exit code according to the\n  comparison result (#593)\n- version 1.14.82\n\n- lr: show the repositories keep-packages flag (bsc#1232458)\n  It is shown in the  details view or by using -k,--keep-packages.\n  In addition libyzpp supports to enforce keeping downloaded\n  packages of all repos within a package cache by creating a\n  '.keep_packages' file there.\n- version 1.14.81\n\n- Try to refresh update repos first to have updated GPG keys on\n  the fly (bsc#1234752)\n  An update repo may contain a prolonged GPG key for the GA repo.\n  Refreshing the update repo first updates a trusted key on the fly\n  and avoids a 'key has expired' warning being issued when\n  refreshing the GA repo.\n- Refresh: restore legacy behavior and suppress Exception\n  reporting as non-root (bsc#1235636)\n- version 1.14.80\n\n- info: Allow to query a specific version (jsc#PED-11268)\n  To query for a specific version simply append \u0026quot;-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;\u0026quot; or\n  \u0026quot;-\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;release\u0026gt;\u0026quot; to the \u0026quot;\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;\u0026quot; pattern.

We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's\nchecked most frequently during backtracking.\n\nThis change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of\nprecision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known\ndeficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of\nverified states, explored in the subsequent patches.\n\nThere are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files\naccording to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).\n\nFile                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)\n--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------\ntest_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)\nxdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)\n\nNote, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to\nminimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between\nbpf and bpf-next trees.\n\nNotice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of\ninstruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of\nrelying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we\nalready have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we\nadded jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but\nalso we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we\ndon't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is\npresent.\n\nRelying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one\nthat was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.\n\n  [0] https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20231110002638.4168352-3-andrii@kernel.org/",

When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0689.",

When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash.

      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.\n\nRecently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while\nreconnecting to a server.  [0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

There are\nmyriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,\nand others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.\n\nFor guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure\ntracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is\nnecessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing\nis enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).  Per the SDM:\n\n  If the logical processor is operating with Intel PT enabled (if\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn = 1) at the time of VM entry, the \"load\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL\" VM-entry control must be 0.\n\nOn the host side, KVM doesn't validate the guest CPUID configuration\nprovided by userspace, and even worse, uses the guest configuration to\ndecide what MSRs to save/load at VM-Enter and VM-Exit.  E.g. configuring\nguest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware\nwill result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,\nwhich generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential\ndeadlock, etc.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-fabrics: fix kernel crash while shutting down controller\n\nThe nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval,\ncould potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller.\nThis may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue\ndestroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx\nqueue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing\noperation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below:\n\nCall Trace:\n    autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable)\n    __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c\n    blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84\n    blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220\n    nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core]\n    process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0\n    worker_thread+0x340/0x504\n    kthread+0x138/0x140\n    start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18\n\nWhile shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks\nin then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is\nthen invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which\ndecrements the admin-\u003eq_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only\nrequest in the admin queue then the admin-\u003eq_usage_counter becomes zero.\nIf that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_\nqueue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another\ncpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward\nprogress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward\nwe are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the\nissue here's that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue\ndispatch operation hasn't yet finished its work and so it could still\npotentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had\nbeen already deleted and that causes the above crash.\n\nThe above kernel crash is regression caused due to changes implemented\nin commit a54a93d0e359 (\"nvme: move stopping keep-alive into\nnvme_uninit_ctrl()\"). Ideally we should stop keep-alive before destroyin\ng the admin queue and freeing the admin tagset so that it wouldn't sneak\nin during the shutdown operation. However we removed the keep alive stop\noperation from the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in commit\na54a93d0e359 (\"nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()\")\nand added it under nvme_uninit_ctrl() which executes very late in the\nshutdown code path after the admin queue is destroyed and its tagset is\nremoved. So this change created the possibility of keep-alive sneaking in\nand interfering with the shutdown operation and causing observed kernel\ncrash.\n\nTo fix the observed crash, we decided to move nvme_stop_keep_alive() from\nnvme_uninit_ctrl() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). This change would ensure\nthat we don't forward progress and delete the admin queue until the keep-\nalive operation is finished (if it's in-flight) or cancelled and that would\nhelp contain the race condition explained above and hence avoid the crash.\n\nMoving nvme_stop_keep_alive() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() instead of\nadding nvme_stop_keep_alive() to the beginning of the controller shutdown\ncode path in nvme_stop_ctrl(), as was the case earlier before commit\na54a93d0e359 (\"nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()\"),\nwould help save one callsite of nvme_stop_keep_alive().",

Just when\n`tnc_delete()` is about to delete `zroot` and `zp2`:\n\n         zroot\n             \\\n              \\\n              zp2\n                \\\n                 \\\n                 zn\n\n`zroot` and `zp2` get freed and the tree collapses:\n\n           zn\n\n`zn` now becomes the new `zroot`.\n\n`get_znodes_to_commit()` will now only find `zn`, the new `zroot`, and\n`write_index()` will check its `znode-\u003ecparent` that wrongly points to\nthe already freed `zp1`. `ubifs_copy_hash()` thus gets wrongly called\nwith `znode-\u003ecparent-\u003ezbranch[znode-\u003eiip].hash` that triggers the\nuse-after-free!\n\nFix this by explicitly setting `znode-\u003ecparent` to `NULL` in\n`get_znodes_to_commit()` for the root node.

For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and\nto an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.\n\nFix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater\nthan PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct\nread only access instead of the ecap_perms array.\n\nNote that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can\nexceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which\nare already checked before).\n\n[1]\n\nWARNING: CPU: 118 PID: 5329 at drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1900 vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\nCPU: 118 UID: 0 PID: 5329 Comm: simx-qemu-syste Not tainted 6.12.0+ #1\n(snip)\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n ? __warn+0x8d/0x140\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x244/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_rw+0x101/0x1b0 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_core_read+0x1d/0x30 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_device_fops_read+0x27/0x40 [vfio]\n vfs_read+0xbd/0x340\n ? vfio_device_fops_unl_ioctl+0xbb/0x740 [vfio]\n ? __rseq_handle_notify_resume+0xa4/0x4b0\n __x64_sys_pread64+0x96/0xc0\n x64_sys_call+0x1c3d/0x20d0\n do_syscall_64+0x4d/0x120\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a\nslab-use-after-free error.\n\nMove the kref_put(\u0026sfp-\u003ef_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the\nopen_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket\n\nDst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is\nexecuted for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There\nare several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur:\n* an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received,\n  resulting in an exception dst being created\n* a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must\n  start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions\n* after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run\n  before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst\n\nWhen TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has\nexpired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the\nrefcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment\nmade by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the\nconnection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never\nreleased. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but\nthat decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just\nbefore the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After\nip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the\ndst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is\nno longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked\nobject.\n\nAs a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the\nloopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do\nnot contain e5f80fcf869a (\"ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev\"):\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The\npatch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was\n92f1655aa2b22 (\"net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race\"). But 92f1655aa2b22\nmerely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue\nwas present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in\n54c1a859efd9f (\"ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually\nexpired.\") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache\nmember of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but\nthe refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced.\n\nThe IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug.\nWhen the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the\nsk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the\nexception dst.",

This also has the benefit of improving\nreadability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into\nthese helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the\ncode (which was the cause of the original logic error).\n\nAs part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated\ninto a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the\nost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a\nsparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect\nof this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow\nstays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases.

In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1003",
