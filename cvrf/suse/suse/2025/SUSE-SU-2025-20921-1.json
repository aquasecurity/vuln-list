      "Text": "This update for flake-pilot fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate version to 3.1.22.\n\n- Fixes to use flakes as normal user\n\n  Running a flake is a container based instance provisioning\n  and startup. Some part of this process requires root permissions\n  for example mounting the container instance store for the\n  provisioning step. This commit fixes the required calls to\n  be properly managed by sudo.\n\n- seed from entropy\n\n- Fix assignment of random sequence number\n\n  We should use a seed for the sequence as described in\n  https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-seeding.html#a-simple-number\n  In addition the logic when a random sequence number should\n  be used was wrong and needed a fix regarding resume and\n  attach type flakes which must not use a random sequence\n\n- Pass --init option for resume type flakes\n\n  In resume mode a sleep command is used to keep the container\n  open. However, without the --init option there is no signal\n  handling available. This commit fixes it\n\n- Revert \"kill prior remove when using %remove flag\"\n\n  This reverts commit 06c7d4aa71f74865dfecba399fd08cc2fde2e1f2.\n  no hard killing needed with the event loop entrypoint\n\n- Fixed CVE-2025-55159 slab: incorrect bounds check\n\n  Update to slab 0.4.11 to fix the mentioned CVE.\n  This Fixes bsc#1248004\n\n- Apply clippy fixes\n\n- Create sequence number for the same invocation\n\n  If a flake which is not a resume or attach flake is called twice\n  with the same invocation arguments an error message is displayed\n  to give this invocation a new name via the @NAME runtime option.\n  This commit makes this more comfortable and automatically assigns\n  a random sequence number for the call if no @NAME is given.\n\n- kill prior remove when using %remove flag\n\n  In case the container instance should be removed via the %remove\n  flag, send a kill first, followed by a force remove. The reason\n  for this is because we use a never ending sleep command as entry\n  point for resume type containers. If they should be removed the\n  standard signal send on podman rm will not stop the sleep and\n  after a period of 10 seconds podman sends a kill signal itself.\n  We can speedup this process as we know the entry point command\n  and send the kill signal first followed by the remove which\n  saves us some wait time spent in podman otherwise.\n\n- Fix clippy hints\n\n  variables can be used directly in the format! string\n\n- Prune old images after load\n\n  Make sure no \u003cnone\u003e image references stay in the registry\n\n",

      "Description": "slab is a pre-allocated storage for a uniform data type. In version 0.4.10, the get_disjoint_mut method incorrectly checked if indices were within the slab's capacity instead of its length, allowing access to uninitialized memory. This could lead to undefined behavior or potential crashes. This has been fixed in slab 0.4.11. A workaround for this issue involves to avoid using get_disjoint_mut with indices that might be beyond the slab's actual length.",
