It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size.

For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw().

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: don't query the device logical block size multiple times\n\nDevices block sizes may change. One of these cases is a loop device by\nusing ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWhile this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of\nhfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write\nout-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the\nlatter function reads a different io_size.\n\nUsing a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the\npurposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between\nHFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the\nmax between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not\ninitialized.\n\nTested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024\nand 4096.\n\nThe produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:\n\n[  419.944641] ==================================================================\n[  419.945655] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.946703] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800721fc00 by task repro/10678\n[  419.947612]\n[  419.947846] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10678 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00008-gdf56e0f2f3ca #84\n[  419.949007] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[  419.950035] Call Trace:\n[  419.950384]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  419.950676]  dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x78\n[  419.951212]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.951830]  print_report+0x14c/0x49e\n[  419.952361]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x267/0x278\n[  419.952979]  ? kmem_cache_debug_flags+0xc/0x1d\n[  419.953561]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.954231]  kasan_report+0x89/0xb0\n[  419.954748]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955367]  hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955948]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x10/0x10\n[  419.956618]  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x59/0x1a9\n[  419.957214]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1a/0x2e\n[  419.957772]  hfsplus_fill_super+0x348/0x1590\n[  419.958355]  ? hlock_class+0x4c/0x109\n[  419.958867]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.959499]  ? __pfx_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.960006]  ? lock_acquire+0x3e2/0x454\n[  419.960532]  ? bdev_name.constprop.0+0xce/0x243\n[  419.961129]  ? __pfx_bdev_name.constprop.0+0x10/0x10\n[  419.961799]  ? pointer+0x3f0/0x62f\n[  419.962277]  ? __pfx_pointer+0x10/0x10\n[  419.962761]  ? vsnprintf+0x6c4/0xfba\n[  419.963178]  ? __pfx_vsnprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.963621]  ? setup_bdev_super+0x376/0x3b3\n[  419.964029]  ? snprintf+0x9d/0xd2\n[  419.964344]  ? __pfx_snprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.964675]  ? lock_acquired+0x45c/0x5e9\n[  419.965016]  ? set_blocksize+0x139/0x1c1\n[  419.965381]  ? sb_set_blocksize+0x6d/0xae\n[  419.965742]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966179]  mount_bdev+0x12f/0x1bf\n[  419.966512]  ? __pfx_mount_bdev+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966886]  ? vfs_parse_fs_string+0xce/0x111\n[  419.967293]  ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.967702]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.968073]  legacy_get_tree+0x104/0x178\n[  419.968414]  vfs_get_tree+0x86/0x296\n[  419.968751]  path_mount+0xba3/0xd0b\n[  419.969157]  ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.969594]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x1e2/0x260\n[  419.970311]  do_mount+0x99/0xe0\n[  419.970630]  ? __pfx_do_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.971008]  __do_sys_mount+0x199/0x1c9\n[  419.971397]  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x135\n[  419.971761]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[  419.972233] RIP: 0033:0x7c3cb812972e\n[  419.972564] Code: 48 8b 0d f5 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d c2 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\n[  419.974371] RSP: 002b:00007ffe30632548 EFLAGS: 00000286 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n[  419.975048] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe306328d8 RCX: 00007c3cb812972e\n[  419.975701] RDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000020000c80 RDI:\n---truncated---",

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a\nslab-use-after-free error.\n\nMove the kref_put(\u0026sfp-\u003ef_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the\nopen_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot.

This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",

In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue.
