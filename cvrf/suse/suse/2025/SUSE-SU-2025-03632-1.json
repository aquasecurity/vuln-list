      "Description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause\nmemory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations\n\nImpact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such\nas the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.\nHowever, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are\naffected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",

      "Description": "Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using\npassword based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.\n\nImpact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to\nDenial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause\na memory corruption which can have various consequences including\na Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.\n\nAlthough the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability\ncould be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to\nperform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS\nmessages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as\nModerate severity according to our Security Policy.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary.",
