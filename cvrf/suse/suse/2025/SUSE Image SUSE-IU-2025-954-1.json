      "Text": "This image update for google/sles-15-sp6-sapcal-v20250409-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage apache2 was updated:\n\n- Fix for bsc#1233433.  MPM: Copy %post section triggering update-alternatives to %posttrans\n  as 'zypper dup' never triggers %post, but it does trigger %posttrans.\n\nPackage apparmor was updated:\n\n- Allow dovecot-auth to execute unix_chkpwd from /sbin, not only from /usr/bin  (bsc#1234452)\n  * Update dovecot-unix_chkpwd.diff\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Update named.root to latest version- Update to release 9.18.33\n  Security Fixes:\n  * DNS-over-HTTPS flooding fixes.\n    Fix DNS-over-HTTPS implementation issues that arise under heavy\n    query load. Optimize resource usage for named instances that\n    accept queries over DNS-over-HTTPS.\n    Previously, named processed all incoming HTTP/2 data at once,\n    which could overwhelm the server, especially when dealing with\n    clients that sent requests but did not wait for responses. That\n    has been fixed. Now, named handles HTTP/2 data in smaller\n    chunks and throttles reading until the remote side reads the\n    response data. It also throttles clients that send too many\n    requests at once.\n    In addition, named now evaluates excessive streams opened by\n    clients that include no DNS data, which is considered\n    âflooding.â It logs these clients and drops connections from\n    them.\n    In some cases, named could leave DNS-over-HTTPS connections in\n    the CLOSE_WAIT state indefinitely. That has also been fixed.\n    (CVE-2024-12705)\n    [bsc#1236597]\n  * Limit additional section processing for large RDATA sets.\n    When answering queries, donât add data to the additional\n    section if the answer has more than 13 names in the RDATA. This\n    limits the number of lookups into the database(s) during a\n    single client query, reducing the query-processing load.\n    (CVE-2024-11187)\n    [bsc#1236596]\n  New Features:\n  * Add a new option to configure the maximum number of outgoing\n    queries per client request.\n  * The configuration option max-query-count sets how many outgoing\n    queries per client request are allowed. The existing\n    max-recursion-queries value is the number of permissible\n    queries for a single name and is reset on every CNAME\n    redirection. This new option is a global limit on the client\n    request. The default is 200.\n  * The default for max-recursion-queries is changed from 32 to 50.\n    This allows named to send a few more queries while looking up a\n    single name.\n  * Print the full path of the working directory in startup log\n    messages.\n    named now prints its initial working directory during startup,\n    and the changed working directory when loading or reloading its\n    configuration file, if it has a valid directory option defined.\n  * Added WALLET type.\n    Add the new record type WALLET (262). This provides a mapping\n    from a domain name to a cryptographic currency wallet. Multiple\n    mappings can exist if multiple records exist.\n  * Update built-in bind.keys file with the new 2025 IANA root key.\n  * Add an initial-ds entry to bind.keys for the new root key, ID\n    38696, which is scheduled for publication in January 2025.\n  Feature Changes:\n  * Tighten max-recursion-queries and add max-query-restarts\n    configuration statement.\n    There were cases when the max-recursion-queries quota was\n    ineffective. It was possible to craft zones that would cause a\n    resolver to waste resources by sending excessive queries while\n    attempting to resolve a name. This has been addressed by\n    correcting errors in the implementation of\n    max-recursion-queries and by reducing the default value from\n    100 to 32.\n    In addition, a new max-query-restarts configuration statement\n    has been added, which limits the number of times a recursive\n    server will follow CNAME or DNAME records before terminating\n    resolution. This was previously a hard-coded limit of 16 but is\n    now configurable with a default value of 11.\n  * Raise the log level of priming failures.\n    When a priming query is complete, it was previously logged at\n    level DEBUG(1), regardless of success or failure. It is now\n    logged to NOTICE in the case of failure.\n  * Add a compatibility shim for older libuv versions (\u0026lt; 1.19.0)\n    The function uv_stream_get_write_queue_size() is supported only\n    in relatively new versions of libuv (1.19.0 or higher). Provide\n    a compatibility shim for this function so BIND 9 can be built\n    in environments with older libuv versions.\n  * Improve performance for queries that require an NSEC3 wildcard\n    proof.\n    Rather than starting from the longest matching part of the\n    requested name, lookup the shortest partial match. Most of the\n    time this will be the actual closest encloser.\n  * Follow the number of CPUs set by taskset/cpuset.\n    Administrators may wish to constrain the set of cores that\n    named runs on via the taskset, cpuset, or numactl programs (or\n    equivalents on other OSes).\n    If the admin has used taskset, named now automatically uses the\n    given number of CPUs rather than the system-wide count.\n  * Allow IXFR-to-AXFR fallback on DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.\n    This change allows fallback from an IXFR failure to AXFR when\n    the reason is DNS_R_TOOMANYRECORDS.\n  * Emit more helpful log messages for exceeding\n    max-records-per-type.\n  * The new log message is emitted when adding or updating an RRset\n    fails due to exceeding the max-records-per-type limit. The log\n    includes the owner name and type, corresponding zone name, and\n    the limit value. It will be emitted on loading a zone file,\n    inbound zone transfer (both AXFR and IXFR), handling a DDNS\n    update, or updating a cache DB. Itâs especially helpful in the\n    case of zone transfer, since the secondary side doesnât have\n    direct access to the offending zone data.\n  * It could also be used for max-types-per-name, but this change\n    doesnât implement it yet as itâs much less likely to happen in\n    practice.\n  * Harden key management when key files have become unavailable.\n  * Prior to doing key management, BIND 9 will check if the key\n    files on disk match the expected keys. If key files for\n    previously observed keys have become unavailable, this will\n    prevent the internal key manager from running.\n  Removed Features:\n  * Move contributed DLZ modules into a separate repository. DLZ\n    modules should not be used except in testing. The DLZ modules\n    were not maintained, the DLZ interface itself is going to be\n    scheduled for removal, and the DLZ interface is blocking. Any\n    module that blocks the query to the database blocks the whole\n    server. The DLZ modules now live in\n    https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/dlz-modules repository.\n  Bug Fixes:\n  For a complete list of bug fixes, see:\n  * Bind Release Notes\n    https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9.18.33/notes.html\n  * The changelog in the doc rpm at\n    /usr/share/doc/packages/bind/arm/html/changelog.html\n\nPackage branding-SLE was updated:\n\n- Update plymouth theme to fix splash screen element placement issue.

configure the\n  kernel is used to build modules a warning is issued and the build\n  continues. This could be turned into an error but that would be too\n  restrictive.\n  The generated kernel-devel makefile could set the compiler but then the\n  main Makefile as to be patched to assign CC with ?=\n  This causes run_oldconfig failure on SUSE-2024 and kbuild config check\n  failure on SUSE-2025.\n  This cannot be hardcoded to one version in a regular patch because the\n  value is expected to be configurable at mkspec time. Patch the Makefile\n  after aplyin patches in rpm prep step instead. A check is added to\n  verify that the sed command did indeed apply the change.\n- commit 6031391\n\n- tracing/osnoise: Fix resetting of tracepoints (CVE-2025-21733\n  bsc#1238494).\n- commit

Good question:\n  1. the spec file during the build get patched. `@BUILD_FLAVOR@`\n    gets replaced with the value. which means the src rpm between\n    build flavor builds is not identical. Also the last built\n    src.rpm will be published. with different content and runtime\n    requires (aka our BuildRequires).\n  2. for historical reasons the internal dependency tracking goes\n    via the src.rpm package. So without having differently named\n    src.rpms the build cycle we were trying to solve was not\n    actually solved. So we append a suffix to the Name attribute\n    in the preamble now.\n\n- In the previous change to enable the cmake based build\n  we also needed python3-Sphinx to build the man pages, as unlike\n  the autotools based build, the cmake based build does not fall\n  back to the pre-built man pages.\n  This causes build cycle.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section-\u003eusage\n\nThe below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory\nregion with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.  The crash logs can be seen at [1].\n\ncompact_zone()\t\t\tmemunmap_pages\n-------------\t\t\t---------------\n__pageblock_pfn_to_page\n   ......\n (a)pfn_valid():\n     valid_section()//return true\n\t\t\t      (b)__remove_pages()-\u003e\n\t\t\t\t  sparse_remove_section()-\u003e\n\t\t\t\t    section_deactivate():\n\t\t\t\t    [Free the array ms-\u003eusage and set\n\t\t\t\t     ms-\u003eusage = NULL]\n     pfn_section_valid()\n     [Access ms-\u003eusage which\n     is NULL]\n\nNOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced to between\nthe pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate with\nSPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.\n\nThe commit b943f045a9af(\"mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with\npfn_section_valid check\") tried to address the same problem by clearing\nthe SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns\nfalse thus ms-\u003eusage is not accessed.\n\nFix this issue by the below steps:\n\na) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the -\u003eusage.\n\nb) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL\n   when SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access -\u003eusage.\n\nc) Free the -\u003eusage with kfree_rcu() and set ms-\u003eusage = NULL.  No\n   attempt will be made to access -\u003eusage after this as the\n   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.\n\nThanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/994410bb-89aa-d987-1f50-f514903c55aa@quicinc.com/\n\nOn Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as\n[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL], we are able to see bunch of\nissues daily while testing on a device farm.\n\nFor this particular issue below is the log.

When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash.

      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

This results in an infinite loop:\n\nentry_tc -\u003e subprog_tc -\u003e entry_freplace --tailcall-\u003e entry_tc.\n\nThe problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to\nzero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism\nto never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, the solution is twofold:\n\n1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a\n   prog_array map.\n2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map\n   with an freplace program.\n\nThis ensures that:\n\n* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,\n  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.\n* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its\n  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.\n\nMoreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return\n-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a\nprog_array map.\n\nAdditionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a\ntab for proper formatting.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: improve shutdown sequence\n\nAlexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the\nlan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens\nto reproduce there.\n\nThe first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it\ncalls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown,\nnot remove):\n\nphy_state_machine()\n-\u003e ...\n   -\u003e dsa_user_phy_read()\n      -\u003e ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n         -\u003e lan9303_phy_read()\n            -\u003e chip-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read()\n               -\u003e lan9303_mdio_phy_read()\n                  -\u003e dev_get_drvdata()\n\nBut we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run\nafter dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is\nto set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come\nafterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.\n\nThe second problem is that the way in which we set\ndp-\u003econduit-\u003edsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet\nprocessing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev-\u003edsa_ptr is NULL,\nbut afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,\ndev-\u003edsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:\ndsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,\nthere is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be\nvalid.\n\nBoth problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface\nsolves them.\n\nIn the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN\nevent in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.\ndsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops\nthe phylink state machine, and ds-\u003eops-\u003ephy_read() will thus no longer\ncall into the driver after this point.\n\nIn the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per\nDocumentation/networking/driver.rst:\n\n| Quiescence\n| ----------\n|\n| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must\n| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must\n| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of\n| any reset commands.\n\nSo it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize\nconduit-\u003edsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call\non this conduit.\n\nThe addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that\nioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer\npropagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.\n\nThe race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f\n(\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\")\nfirst introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we\nstopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just\nreplaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit-\u003edsa_ptr\n(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up).",

Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetlink: terminate outstanding dump on socket close\n\nNetlink supports iterative dumping of data. It provides the families\nthe following ops:\n - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process\n - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0\n - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup\nThe whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump\ndon't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered\nin response to recvmsg() on the socket.\n\nThis gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that\nthe user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.\nTo make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there\nis an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.\n\nThe complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done\nis allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when\nneeded.\n\nUnfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not\nthe cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.\nWe have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone\nelse holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back\nto square one.\n\nThe whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user\ncan interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.\nAnd close always happens in process context. Some async code may\nstill access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.\nbut no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.\n\nDelete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release\nhandler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance\nwe now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,\nso dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own.",

When the network namespace is deleted, the net structure\naccessed by tcp's timer handler function causes problems.\n\nTo fix this problem, let's hold netns refcnt for the tcp kernel socket as\ndone in other modules. This is an ugly hack which can easily be backported\nto earlier kernels. A proper fix which cleans up the interfaces will\nfollow, but may not be so easy to backport.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix use-after-free of slot-\u003ebus on hot remove\n\nDennis reports a boot crash on recent Lenovo laptops with a USB4 dock.\n\nSince commit 0fc70886569c (\"thunderbolt: Reset USB4 v2 host router\") and\ncommit 59a54c5f3dbd (\"thunderbolt: Reset topology created by the boot\nfirmware\"), USB4 v2 and v1 Host Routers are reset on probe of the\nthunderbolt driver.\n\nThe reset clears the Presence Detect State and Data Link Layer Link Active\nbits at the USB4 Host Router's Root Port and thus causes hot removal of the\ndock.\n\nThe crash occurs when pciehp is unbound from one of the dock's Downstream\nPorts:  pciehp creates a pci_slot on bind and destroys it on unbind.  The\npci_slot contains a pointer to the pci_bus below the Downstream Port, but\na reference on that pci_bus is never acquired.  The pci_bus is destroyed\nbefore the pci_slot, so a use-after-free ensues when pci_slot_release()\naccesses slot-\u003ebus.\n\nIn principle this should not happen because pci_stop_bus_device() unbinds\npciehp (and therefore destroys the pci_slot) before the pci_bus is\ndestroyed by pci_remove_bus_device().\n\nHowever the stacktrace provided by Dennis shows that pciehp is unbound from\npci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  To understand\nthe significance of this, one needs to know that the PCI core uses a two\nstep process to remove a portion of the hierarchy:  It first unbinds all\ndrivers in the sub-hierarchy in pci_stop_bus_device() and then actually\nremoves the devices in pci_remove_bus_device().  There is no precaution to\nprevent driver binding in-between pci_stop_bus_device() and\npci_remove_bus_device().\n\nIn Dennis' case, it seems removal of the hierarchy by pciehp races with\ndriver binding by pci_bus_add_devices().  pciehp is bound to the\nDownstream Port after pci_stop_bus_device() has run, so it is unbound by\npci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  Because the\npci_bus has already been destroyed at that point, accesses to it result in\na use-after-free.\n\nOne might conclude that driver binding needs to be prevented after\npci_stop_bus_device() has run.  However it seems risky that pci_slot points\nto pci_bus without holding a reference.  Solely relying on correct ordering\nof driver unbind versus pci_bus destruction is certainly not defensive\nprogramming.\n\nIf pci_slot has a need to access data in pci_bus, it ought to acquire a\nreference.  Amend pci_create_slot() accordingly.  Dennis reports that the\ncrash is not reproducible with this change.\n\nAbridged stacktrace:\n\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: PME: Signaling with IRQ 156\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: pciehp: Slot #12 AttnBtn- PwrCtrl- MRL- AttnInd- PwrInd- HotPlug+ Surprise+ Interlock- NoCompl+ IbPresDis- LLActRep+\n  pci_bus 0000:20: dev 00, created physical slot 12\n  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: pciehp: Slot(12): Card not present\n  ...\n  pcieport 0000:21:02.0: pciehp: pcie_disable_notification: SLOTCTRL d8 write cmd 0\n  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 13 UID: 0 PID: 134 Comm: irq/156-pciehp Not tainted 6.11.0-devel+ #1\n  RIP: 0010:dev_driver_string+0x12/0x40\n  pci_destroy_slot\n  pciehp_remove\n  pcie_port_remove_service\n  device_release_driver_internal\n  bus_remove_device\n  device_del\n  device_unregister\n  remove_iter\n  device_for_each_child\n  pcie_portdrv_remove\n  pci_device_remove\n  device_release_driver_internal\n  bus_remove_device\n  device_del\n  pci_remove_bus_device (recursive invocation)\n  pci_remove_bus_device\n  pciehp_unconfigure_device\n  pciehp_disable_slot\n  pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change\n  pciehp_ist",

In the\nxenbus_dev_probe() function, within the if (err) branch at line 313, the\nprogram incorrectly returns err directly without releasing the resources\nallocated by err = drv-\u003eprobe(dev, id). As the return value is non-zero,\nthe upper layers assume the processing logic has failed.

After entering the branch if (err) at line 313, the\nfunction will use a goto statement to jump to the fail_remove block,\nensuring that the previously acquired resources are correctly released,\nthus preventing the reference count leak.\n\nThis bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed\nby our team.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipvs: fix UB due to uninitialized stack access in ip_vs_protocol_init()\n\nUnder certain kernel configurations when building with Clang/LLVM, the\ncompiler does not generate a return or jump as the terminator\ninstruction for ip_vs_protocol_init(), triggering the following objtool\nwarning during build time:\n\n  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: ip_vs_protocol_init() falls through to next function __initstub__kmod_ip_vs_rr__935_123_ip_vs_rr_init6()\n\nAt runtime, this either causes an oops when trying to load the ipvs\nmodule or a boot-time panic if ipvs is built-in. This same issue has\nbeen reported by the Intel kernel test robot previously.\n\nDigging deeper into both LLVM and the kernel code reveals this to be a\nundefined behavior problem. ip_vs_protocol_init() uses a on-stack buffer\nof 64 chars to store the registered protocol names and leaves it\nuninitialized after definition. The function calls strnlen() when\nconcatenating protocol names into the buffer. With CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE\nstrnlen() performs an extra step to check whether the last byte of the\ninput char buffer is a null character (commit 3009f891bb9f (\"fortify:\nAllow strlen() and strnlen() to pass compile-time known lengths\")).\nThis, together with possibly other configurations, cause the following\nIR to be generated:\n\n  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #5 section \".init.text\" align 16 !kcfi_type !29 {\n    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16\n    ...\n\n  14:                                               ; preds = %11\n    %15 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63\n    %16 = load i8, ptr %15, align 1\n    %17 = tail call i1 @llvm.is.constant.i8(i8 %16)\n    %18 = icmp eq i8 %16, 0\n    %19 = select i1 %17, i1 %18, i1 false\n    br i1 %19, label %20, label %23\n\n  20:                                               ; preds = %14\n    %21 = call i64 @strlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1) #23\n    ...\n\n  23:                                               ; preds = %14, %11, %20\n    %24 = call i64 @strnlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1, i64 noundef 64) #24\n    ...\n  }\n\nThe above code calculates the address of the last char in the buffer\n(value %15) and then loads from it (value %16). Because the buffer is\nnever initialized, the LLVM GVN pass marks value %16 as undefined:\n\n  %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63\n  br i1 undef, label %14, label %17\n\nThis gives later passes (SCCP, in particular) more DCE opportunities by\npropagating the undef value further, and eventually removes everything\nafter the load on the uninitialized stack location:\n\n  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #0 section \".init.text\" align 16 !kcfi_type !11 {\n    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16\n    ...\n\n  12:                                               ; preds = %11\n    %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63\n    unreachable\n  }\n\nIn this way, the generated native code will just fall through to the\nnext function, as LLVM does not generate any code for the unreachable IR\ninstruction and leaves the function without a terminator.\n\nZero the on-stack buffer to avoid this possible UB.",

This reordering prevents the race condition\nfrom happening.",

We still use the\nmax between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not\ninitialized.\n\nTested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024\nand 4096.\n\nThe produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:\n\n[  419.944641] ==================================================================\n[  419.945655] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.946703] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800721fc00 by task repro/10678\n[  419.947612]\n[  419.947846] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10678 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00008-gdf56e0f2f3ca #84\n[  419.949007] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[  419.950035] Call Trace:\n[  419.950384]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  419.950676]  dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x78\n[  419.951212]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.951830]  print_report+0x14c/0x49e\n[  419.952361]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x267/0x278\n[  419.952979]  ? kmem_cache_debug_flags+0xc/0x1d\n[  419.953561]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.954231]  kasan_report+0x89/0xb0\n[  419.954748]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955367]  hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955948]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x10/0x10\n[  419.956618]  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x59/0x1a9\n[  419.957214]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1a/0x2e\n[  419.957772]  hfsplus_fill_super+0x348/0x1590\n[  419.958355]  ? hlock_class+0x4c/0x109\n[  419.958867]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.959499]  ? __pfx_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.960006]  ? lock_acquire+0x3e2/0x454\n[  419.960532]  ? bdev_name.constprop.0+0xce/0x243\n[  419.961129]  ? __pfx_bdev_name.constprop.0+0x10/0x10\n[  419.961799]  ? pointer+0x3f0/0x62f\n[  419.962277]  ? __pfx_pointer+0x10/0x10\n[  419.962761]  ? vsnprintf+0x6c4/0xfba\n[  419.963178]  ? __pfx_vsnprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.963621]  ? setup_bdev_super+0x376/0x3b3\n[  419.964029]  ? snprintf+0x9d/0xd2\n[  419.964344]  ? __pfx_snprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.964675]  ? lock_acquired+0x45c/0x5e9\n[  419.965016]  ? set_blocksize+0x139/0x1c1\n[  419.965381]  ? sb_set_blocksize+0x6d/0xae\n[  419.965742]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966179]  mount_bdev+0x12f/0x1bf\n[  419.966512]  ? __pfx_mount_bdev+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966886]  ? vfs_parse_fs_string+0xce/0x111\n[  419.967293]  ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.967702]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.968073]  legacy_get_tree+0x104/0x178\n[  419.968414]  vfs_get_tree+0x86/0x296\n[  419.968751]  path_mount+0xba3/0xd0b\n[  419.969157]  ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.969594]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x1e2/0x260\n[  419.970311]  do_mount+0x99/0xe0\n[  419.970630]  ? __pfx_do_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.971008]  __do_sys_mount+0x199/0x1c9\n[  419.971397]  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x135\n[  419.971761]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[  419.972233] RIP: 0033:0x7c3cb812972e\n[  419.972564] Code: 48 8b 0d f5 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d c2 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\n[  419.974371] RSP: 002b:00007ffe30632548 EFLAGS: 00000286 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n[  419.975048] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe306328d8 RCX: 00007c3cb812972e\n[  419.975701] RDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000020000c80 RDI:\n---truncated---",

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes\nidr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a\nsimilar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s-\u003ecpu_slab-\u003elock) is\nstill a spinlock.\n\nInstead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking\nhtab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring\nthe invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map\npointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.\nTherefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these\nto-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.\n\nThere are four callers for -\u003emap_fd_put_ptr:\n\n(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIt invokes -\u003emap_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of\nhtab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),\nbecause the old element has already been stashed in htab-\u003eextra_elems.\nIt may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the\ninvocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release\nthe newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer\nof the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and\nreleasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old\nelement, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old\nelement as well.\n\n(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())\nIts caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),\nhtab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().\n\nFor htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after\nhtab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just\nlike lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list\nand invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe\nto reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these\nelements have been removed from the hash llist.\n\nBecause htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,\n__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept\nit as\n---truncated---",

Consequently, during the cacheinfo CPU\nhotplug callback, last_level_cache_is_valid() attempts to dereference\na NULL pointer:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000100\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not present page\n  PGD 0 P4D 0\n  Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEPMT SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 0 PID 19 Comm: cpuhp/0 Not tainted 6.4.0-rc2 #1\n  RIP: 0010: last_level_cache_is_valid+0x95/0xe0a\n\nAllocate memory for cacheinfo during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback\nif not done earlier.\n\nMoreover, before determining the validity of the last-level cache info,\nensure that it has been allocated. Simply checking for non-zero\ncache_leaves() is not sufficient, as some architectures (e.g., Intel\nprocessors) have non-zero cache_leaves() before allocation.\n\nDereferencing NULL cacheinfo can occur in update_per_cpu_data_slice_size().\nThis function iterates over all online CPUs.

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a\nslab-use-after-free error.\n\nMove the kref_put(\u0026sfp-\u003ef_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the\nopen_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper\nsequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the\nrisk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket\n\nDst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is\nexecuted for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There\nare several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur:\n* an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received,\n  resulting in an exception dst being created\n* a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must\n  start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions\n* after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run\n  before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst\n\nWhen TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has\nexpired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the\nrefcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment\nmade by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the\nconnection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never\nreleased. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but\nthat decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just\nbefore the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After\nip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the\ndst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is\nno longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked\nobject.\n\nAs a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the\nloopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do\nnot contain e5f80fcf869a (\"ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev\"):\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The\npatch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was\n92f1655aa2b22 (\"net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race\"). But 92f1655aa2b22\nmerely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue\nwas present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in\n54c1a859efd9f (\"ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually\nexpired.\") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache\nmember of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but\nthe refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced.\n\nThe IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug.\nWhen the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the\nsk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the\nexception dst.",

The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().\n2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an\n   interrupt.\n3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an\n   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has\n   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag\n   remains set.\n4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call\n   of req-\u003ecomplete(), as shown in the call trace above.\n5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)\n   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the\n   request before invoking the callback.\n6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware\n   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains\n   set.\n\nFor this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at\nsome point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet\ngadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the\ntask context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are\nre-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The\ngadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but\nthe first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,\ntriggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet\narrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from\nreceiving any further packets from the USB host.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This\nparticular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:\n\n1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to\n   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was\n   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.\n   Similar \"bugs\" could be hidden in other drivers as well.\n2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback\n   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),\n   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled\n   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow\n   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an\n   inelegant hack.\n3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request\n   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes\n   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is\n   not ready to process them.\n4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().\n   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at\n   least one request in the queue.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Mark raw_tp arguments with PTR_MAYBE_NULL\n\nArguments to a raw tracepoint are tagged as trusted, which carries the\nsemantics that the pointer will be non-NULL.  However, in certain cases,\na raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this\nissue is available in [0].\n\nThus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments\ncan actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never\nNULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such\npointers potentially crashing the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special\ncase the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow\npassing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp\nprograms only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id \u003e 0, as in\nthat case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment.\n\nThe reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will\nrecheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then\nconsider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the\nPTR_MAYBE_NULL flag.\n\nTo allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads\ninto trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL.\n\nWhile trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs\nwhere such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will\ntackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can\nalready be passed into helpers and causes similar problems. Thus, they\nare left alone for now.\n\nIt is possible that these checks also permit passing non-raw_tp args\nthat are trusted PTR_TO_BTF_ID with null marking. In such a case,\nallowing dereference when pointer is NULL expands allowed behavior, so\nwon't regress existing programs, and the case of passing these into\nhelpers is the same as above and will be dealt with later.\n\nAlso update the failure case in tp_btf_nullable selftest to capture the\nnew behavior, as the verifier will no longer cause an error when\ndirectly dereference a raw tracepoint argument marked as __nullable.\n\n  [0]: https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/ZrCZS6nisraEqehw@jlelli-thinkpadt14gen4.remote.csb",

Using the `bird` service, these\nrouters continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequently\nchanging nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6\ntraffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipath\ncircular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularly\nwhile iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typically\narises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deleted\nconcurrently on a different core-indicated by their 'next' and\n'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their reference\ncount dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to a\nsoft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer.\n\nApply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve the\nissue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings to\nannotate or use the RCU APIs.\n\nInclude a test script that reproduces the issue. The script\nperiodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy load\nof outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients.

This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc\n\nIn general, 'qlen' of any classful qdisc should keep track of the\nnumber of packets that the qdisc itself and all of its children holds.\nIn case of netem, 'qlen' only accounts for the packets in its internal\ntfifo. When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use\n'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created\nor dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics\nof netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.\n'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.\nIf a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent\nabout this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the\nnewly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.\nIf 'qlen' reaches the configured sch-\u003elimit, the enqueue function stops\nworking, even though the tfifo is not full.\n\nReproduce the bug:\nEnsure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root\nqdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine\nas follows:\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100\n$ tc qdisc add dev \u003coif\u003e parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms\n\nSend bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3\nclient on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:\n$ tc -s qdisc show dev \u003coif\u003e\n\nStatistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that\nnetem's backlog \u003e limit, netem stopped accepting packets):\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\nStatistics after the fix:\nqdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\nqdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms\n Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)\n backlog 0b 0p requeues 0\n\ntbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.\nThe interface fully stops transferring packets and \"locks\". In this case,\nthe child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at\nits limit and no more packets are accepted.\n\nThis patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is\nonly decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not\nduring enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus\naccounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As\nin other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in\nnetem and all of its children. As before, sch-\u003elimit remains as the\nmaximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's\nbacklog statistics.",

It targets the\nsame problem as the following downstream commit:\n\n  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995\n\nUnlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe\ndevice if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k\nor iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the\ndriver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with\nexisting practices.\n\nUpon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error.

This\nhelps with stack trace de-duplication, avoiding an explosion of saved\nstack traces that share the same IRQ context code path but originate\nfrom different randomly interrupted points, eventually exhausting the\nstack depot.\n\nFiltering uses in_irqentry_text() to identify functions within the\n.irqentry.text and .softirqentry.text sections, which then become the\nlast stack trace entries being saved.\n\nWhile __do_softirq() is placed into the .softirqentry.text section by\ncommon code, populating .irqentry.text is architecture-specific.\n\nCurrently, the .irqentry.text section on s390 is empty, which prevents\nstack depot filtering and de-duplication and could result in warnings\nlike:\n\nStack depot reached limit capacity\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 286113 at lib/stackdepot.c:252 depot_alloc_stack+0x39a/0x3c8\n\nwith PREEMPT and KASAN enabled.\n\nFix this by moving the IO/EXT interrupt handlers from .kprobes.text into\nthe .irqentry.text section and updating the kprobes blacklist to include\nthe .irqentry.text section.\n\nThis is done only for asynchronous interrupts and explicitly not for\nprogram checks, which are synchronous and where the context beyond the\nprogram check is important to preserve. Despite machine checks being\nsomewhat in between, they are extremely rare, and preserving context\nwhen possible is also of value.\n\nSVCs and Restart Interrupts are not relevant, one being always at the\nboundary to user space and the other being a one-time thing.\n\nIRQ entries filtering is also optionally used in ftrace function graph,\nwhere the same logic applies.",

Consequently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() will consume an\narbitrary value, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the\nkernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and\nthe issue does not provide a write mechanism.\n\nAs set_tagged_addr_ctrl() only accepts values where bits [63:4] zero and\nrejects other values, a partial SETREGSET attempt will randomly succeed\nor fail depending on the value of the uninitialized value, and the\nexposure is significantly limited.\n\nFix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset\nfrom userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,\nNT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing\nvalue of the tagged address ctrl will be retained.\n\nThe NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL regset is only visible in the\nuser_aarch64_view used by a native AArch64 task to manipulate another\nnative AArch64 task. As get_tagged_addr_ctrl() only returns an error\nvalue when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and\ntagged_addr_ctrl_set() should never observe an error value from\nget_tagged_addr_ctrl().

As a result, the system tries to lock the mutex whole holding\nthe spinlock.\n\nIt seems, the internal regmap locks are not needed in this driver at all.\nmcp-\u003elock seems to protect the regmap from concurrent accesses already,\nexcept, probably, in mcp_pinconf_get/set.\n\nmcp23s08_irq_set_type() and mcp23s08_irq_mask/unmask() are called under\nchip_bus_lock(), which calls mcp23s08_irq_bus_lock(). The latter takes\nmcp-\u003elock and enables regmap caching, so that the potentially slow I2C\naccesses are deferred until chip_bus_unlock().\n\nThe accesses to the regmap from mcp23s08_probe_one() do not need additional\nlocking.\n\nIn all remaining places where the regmap is accessed, except\nmcp_pinconf_get/set(), the driver already takes mcp-\u003elock.\n\nThis patch adds locking in mcp_pinconf_get/set() and disables internal\nlocking in the regmap config. Among other things, it fixes the sleeping\nin atomic context described above.",

After the server receives the first\ndatagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to\nthe address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow.\n\nNow, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to\nsend a (subsequent) datagram while the server's socket changes its\naddress, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed\nlookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as\napparent from the following reproducer:\n\n  LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4))\n  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in\n\n  while :; do\n  \ttaskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc \u0026\n  \tsleep 0.1 || sleep 1\n  \ttaskset -c 2 socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null\n  \twait\n  done\n\nwhere the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write()\n(typically the second or third one of a given iteration):\n\n  2024/11/13 21:28:23 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192): Connection refused\n\nThis issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podman's tests\nchecking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the\ncontainer's network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with\nthe lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device:\n\n  LOCAL_ADDR=\"$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM '.[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == \"global\").local')\"\n\n  while :; do\n  \t./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc \u0026\n  \tsleep 0.2 || sleep 1\n  \tsocat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:${LOCAL_ADDR}:1337,shut-null\n  \twait\n  \tcmp tmp.in tmp.out\n  done\n\nOnce this fails:\n\n  tmp.in tmp.out differ: char 8193, line 29\n\nwe can finally have a look at what's going on:\n\n  $ tshark -r pasta.pcap\n      1   0.000000           :: ? ff02::16     ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2\n      2   0.168690 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      3   0.168767 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      4   0.168806 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      5   0.168827 c6:47:05:8d:dc:04 ?

That seems like the simplest way to fix this, so I've\nimplemented his suggestion, using __register_chrdev() with pps_idr\nbecoming the source of truth for which minor corresponds to which\ndevice.\n\nBut now that pps_idr defines userspace visibility instead of cdev_add(),\nwe need to be sure the pps-\u003edev refcount can't reach zero while\nuserspace can still find it again. So, the idr_remove() call moves to\npps_unregister_cdev(), and pps_idr now holds a reference to pps-\u003edev.\n\n    pps_core: source serial1 got cdev (251:1)\n    \u003c...\u003e\n    pps pps1: removed\n    pps_core: unregistering pps1\n    pps_core: deallocating pps1",

One of\nthe errors was fixed by commit ea427a222d8b (\"HID: core: Fix deadloop\nin hid_apply_multiplier.\"), but the other has not been fixed.\n\nThis error arises because hid_apply_multipler() assumes that every\nResolution Multiplier control is contained in a Logical Collection,\ni.e., there's no way the routine can ever set multiplier_collection to\nNULL.  This is in spite of the fact that the function starts with a\nbig comment saying:\n\n\t * \"The Resolution Multiplier control must be contained in the same\n\t * Logical Collection as the control(s) to which it is to be applied.\n\t   ...\n\t *  If no Logical Collection is\n\t * defined, the Resolution Multiplier is associated with all\n\t * controls in the report.\"\n\t * HID Usage Table, v1.12, Section 4.3.1, p30\n\t *\n\t * Thus, search from the current collection upwards until we find a\n\t * logical collection...\n\nThe comment and the code overlook the possibility that none of the\ncollections found may be a Logical Collection.\n\nThe fix is to set the multiplier_collection pointer to NULL if the\ncollection found isn't a Logical Collection.",

At this point qlen is 1, and all of the SFQ slots are empty,\n  however q-\u003etail is not NULL.\n\nAt this point, assuming no more packets are queued, when sch_dequeue\nruns again it will decrement the qlen for the current empty slot\ncausing an underflow and the subsequent out of bounds access.",

GSP calculates the number of pages to write from the\ntotal size of a GSP message. This behavior can be observed from the\nmovement of the write pointer.\n\nHowever, nvkm takes only the size of RPC header and message body as\nthe message size when advancing the read pointer. When handling a\ntwo-page GSP message in the non rollback case, It wrongly takes the\nmessage body of the previous message as the message header of the next\nmessage. As the \"message length\" tends to be zero, in the calculation of\nsize needs to be copied (0 - size of (message header)), the size needs to\nbe copied will be \"0xffffffxx\".

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: convert workqueues to unbound\n\nWhen a workqueue is created with `WQ_UNBOUND`, its work items are\nserved by special worker-pools, whose host workers are not bound to\nany specific CPU. In the default configuration (i.e. when\n`queue_delayed_work` and friends do not specify which CPU to run the\nwork item on), `WQ_UNBOUND` allows the work item to be executed on any\nCPU in the same node of the CPU it was enqueued on. While this\nsolution potentially sacrifices locality, it avoids contention with\nother processes that might dominate the CPU time of the processor the\nwork item was scheduled on.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical problem: in a particular scenario\nmisconfigured process was hogging most of the time from CPU0, leaving\nless than 0.5% of its CPU time to the kworker. The IDPF workqueues\nthat were using the kworker on CPU0 suffered large completion delays\nas a result, causing performance degradation, timeouts and eventual\nsystem crash.\n\n\n* I have also run a manual test to gauge the performance\n  improvement. The test consists of an antagonist process\n  (`./stress --cpu 2`) consuming as much of CPU 0 as possible. This\n  process is run under `taskset 01` to bind it to CPU0, and its\n  priority is changed with `chrt -pQ 9900 10000 ${pid}` and\n  `renice -n -20 ${pid}` after start.\n\n  Then, the IDPF driver is forced to prefer CPU0 by editing all calls\n  to `queue_delayed_work`, `mod_delayed_work`, etc... to use CPU 0.\n\n  Finally, `ktraces` for the workqueue events are collected.\n\n  Without the current patch, the antagonist process can force\n  arbitrary delays between `workqueue_queue_work` and\n  `workqueue_execute_start`, that in my tests were as high as\n  `30ms`. With the current patch applied, the workqueue can be\n  migrated to another unloaded CPU in the same node, and, keeping\n  everything else equal, the maximum delay I could see was `6us`.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registers\n\nThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an -\u003eactive() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this -\u003eactive() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The -\u003eactive() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the -\u003eget() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are\nset at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be\nsomething to find in the XSAVE buffer.\n\n[ dhansen: changelog/subject tweaks ]",

This also has the benefit of improving\nreadability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into\nthese helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the\ncode (which was the cause of the original logic error).\n\nAs part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated\ninto a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the\nost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a\nsparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect\nof this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow\nstays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should\nnot make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth\ncomplicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function\n\nThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()\nand cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() -\u003e\nlist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these\nfunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead\nto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the\nsubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a\nmodification.\n\nIn the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP\nfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list\nhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and\nturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the\nlist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this\noccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and\na UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,\nprior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it\nwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's\nsynchronize_rcu.\n\nThe thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins\nlist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just\nthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.\n\nFortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()\nfunction to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single\nREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.\n\nThis was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning\nsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",

It sets carrier ON\non start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.\nAnd it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.\nTherefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit\nthe infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There\nmight be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is\nimportant for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a\npacket sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the\nissue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.\n\nFix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running\nstate is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers\nunregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets\nto devices that are not running anyway.\n\nWhile only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier\ncheck is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined\nthroughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions\nlike __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit\na packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well.",

As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an\ninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.\n\n[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000c0\n[  466.318928] Mem abort info:\n[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  466.341900] Data abort info:\n[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000\n[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000\n[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seq snd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4 snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidev rpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_be btbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_cipher snd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mul snd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2 snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_sched snd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_pio drm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1 raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uio i2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fuse dm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: G         C         6.13.0-v8+ #18\n[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP\n[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)\n[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d]\n[  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228\n[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0\n[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24: ffffff8003bdc200\n[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21: 0000000000000000\n[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15: 0000000000000000\n[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000\n[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : ffffffd08c527eb0\n[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 : ffffffc080003f70\n[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.567263] Call trace:\n[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)\n[  466.\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug\n\nIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the\ncurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used\nthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,\nit is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.\n\nIf the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,\nwe run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx\nare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. \nacomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use\ncrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the\ncrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was\nretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the\nCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the\ncrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.\n\nUse the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating\nand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure\nthat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the\ncompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after\nacquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new\nCPU.\n\nThe initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug\ncallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is\nallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU\nhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by\ncompression/decompression.\n\nPreviously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This\nwould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already\nholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a\ndeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but\nJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug\nnotifiers [2].\n\nAlternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:\n- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in\n  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in\n  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the\n  CPU is onlined.\n- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but\n  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could\n  result in subtle performance issues.\n\n[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n\n[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]",

Some of the used metric sources require\nlocks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU\nlist iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work\naround of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then\nrun this in a new context.\n\nEven when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major\nproblems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed\nanymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or\nthe batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory\naccesses.\n\nDirectly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:\n\n* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with\n  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use\n  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that\n  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker\n  to finish.\n* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is\n  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is\n  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated\n  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check\n  but not for a cleanup routine (which must \"stop\" all still running\n  workers)\n\nThe better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric\nworker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems\nare solved by:\n\n* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside\n  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list\n  outside the RCU protected context\n* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock\n  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code\n  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)",

However, it will make the concurrent\noverwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when\nthe map is full.\n\nTherefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling\nof bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:\n1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value\n2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to\n   cancel it again\nConsidering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try\nto acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is\nrunning, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has\ndownside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is\ndelayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable\n(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in\nlocked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if\nnecessary.\n\nIt is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the\nproblem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the\nsoftirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced\nin v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra\ndepends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.\n\nDepends-on: v6.12+ with PREEMPT_RT enabled",

When the system is\nsuspended if the port is not power manageable by the platform and won't be\nused for wakeup via a PME this sets up the policy for these ports to go\ninto D3hot.\n\nThis policy generally makes sense from an OSPM perspective but it leads to\nproblems with wakeup from suspend on the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a\nspecific old BIOS. This manifests as a system hang.\n\nOn the affected Device + BIOS combination, add a quirk for the root port of\nthe problematic controller to ensure that these root ports are not put into\nD3hot at suspend.\n\nThis patch is based on\n\n  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230708214457.1229-2-mario.limonciello@amd.com\n\nbut with the added condition both in the documentation and in the code to\napply only to the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a specific old BIOS and only\nthe affected root ports.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/mlx5: Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP\n\nThis patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP,\nensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1].\n\nDuring recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the\nsoftware must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.\n\nFailing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed\nCQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB\nspecification.\n\nThis race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.\n\nTo resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a\nbarrier before moving the QP state to RESET.\n\nOnce a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no\noutstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and\nsubsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.\n\nNote:\nFor the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR.\nSince the QP is in an error state, it will only receive\nIB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't\ncare about its status.\n\n[1]\nINFO: task rdma_resource_l:1922 blocked for more than 120 seconds.\nTainted: G        W          6.12.0-rc7+ #1626\n\"echo 0 \u003e /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\ntask:rdma_resource_l state:D stack:0  pid:1922 tgid:1922  ppid:1369\n     flags:0x00004004\nCall Trace:\n\u003cTASK\u003e\n__schedule+0x420/0xd30\nschedule+0x47/0x130\nschedule_timeout+0x280/0x300\n? mark_held_locks+0x48/0x80\n? lockdep_hardirqs_on_prepare+0xe5/0x1a0\nwait_for_completion+0x75/0x130\nmlx5r_umr_post_send_wait+0x3c2/0x5b0 [mlx5_ib]\n? __pfx_mlx5r_umr_done+0x10/0x10 [mlx5_ib]\nmlx5r_umr_revoke_mr+0x93/0xc0 [mlx5_ib]\n__mlx5_ib_dereg_mr+0x299/0x520 [mlx5_ib]\n? _raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x24/0x40\n? wait_for_completion+0xfe/0x130\n? rdma_restrack_put+0x63/0xe0 [ib_core]\nib_dereg_mr_user+0x5f/0x120 [ib_core]\n? lock_release+0xc6/0x280\ndestroy_hw_idr_uobject+0x1d/0x60 [ib_uverbs]\nuverbs_destroy_uobject+0x58/0x1d0 [ib_uverbs]\nuobj_destroy+0x3f/0x70 [ib_uverbs]\nib_uverbs_cmd_verbs+0x3e4/0xbb0 [ib_uverbs]\n? __pfx_uverbs_destroy_def_handler+0x10/0x10 [ib_uverbs]\n? __lock_acquire+0x64e/0x2080\n? mark_held_locks+0x48/0x80\n? find_held_lock+0x2d/0xa0\n? lock_acquire+0xc1/0x2f0\n? ib_uverbs_ioctl+0xcb/0x170 [ib_uverbs]\n? __fget_files+0xc3/0x1b0\nib_uverbs_ioctl+0xe7/0x170 [ib_uverbs]\n? ib_uverbs_ioctl+0xcb/0x170 [ib_uverbs]\n__x64_sys_ioctl+0x1b0/0xa70\ndo_syscall_64+0x6b/0x140\nentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\nRIP: 0033:0x7f99c918b17b\nRSP: 002b:00007ffc766d0468 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX:\n     0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffc766d0578 RCX:\n     00007f99c918b17b\nRDX: 00007ffc766d0560 RSI: 00000000c0181b01 RDI:\n     0000000000000003\nRBP: 00007ffc766d0540 R08: 00007f99c8f99010 R09:\n     000000000000bd7e\nR10: 00007f99c94c1c70 R11: 0000000000000246 R12:\n     00007ffc766d0530\nR13: 000000000000001c R14: 0000000040246a80 R15:\n     0000000000000000\n\u003c/TASK\u003e",

In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1003",

The bug has been fixed in XZ Utils 5.8.1, and the fix has been committed to the v5.4, v5.6, v5.8, and master branches in the xz Git repository.
