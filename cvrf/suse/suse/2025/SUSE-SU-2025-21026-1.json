      "Text": "This update for samba fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to 4.22.5:\n\n  * CVE-2025-10230: Command injection via WINS server hook script (bsc#1251280).\n  * CVE-2025-9640: uninitialized memory disclosure via vfs_streams_xattr (bsc#1251279).\n\n- Relax samba-gpupdate requirement for cepces, certmonger, and sscep\n  to a recommends. They are only required if utilizing certificate\n  auto enrollment (bsc#1249087).\n\n- Disable timeouts for smb.service so that possibly slow running\n  ExecStartPre script 'update-samba-security-profile' doesn't\n  cause service start to fail due to timeouts (bsc#1249181).\n\n- Ensure semanage is pulled in as a requirement when samba in\n  installed when selinux security access mechanism that is used\n  (bsc#1249180).\n\n- don't attempt to label paths that don't exist, also remove\n  unecessary evaluation of semange \u0026 restorecon cmds (bsc#1249179).\n\nUpdate to 4.22.4:\n\n  * netr_LogonSamLogonEx returns NR_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED with\n    SysvolReady=0\n  * getpwuid does not shift to new DC when current DC is down\n  * Windows security hardening locks out schannel'ed netlogon dc\n    calls like netr_DsRGetDCName-\n  * Unresponsive second DC can cause idmapping failure when using\n    idmap_ad-\n  * kinit command is failing with Missing cache Error.\n  * Figuring out the DC name from IP address fails and breaks\n    fork_domain_child().\n  * vfs_streams_depot fstatat broken.\n  * Delayed leader broadcast can block ctdb forever.\n  * Apparently there is a conflict between shadow_copy2 module\n    and virusfilter (action quarantine).\n  * Fix handling of empty GPO link.\n  * SMB ACL inheritance doesn't work for files created.\n\n- adjust gpgme build dependency for future-proofing\n\n",
