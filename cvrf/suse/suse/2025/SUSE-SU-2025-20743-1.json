Users can\n  manually use \"docker buildx ...\" commands or set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 in order\n  to opt-in to using docker-buildx.\n\n  Users can silence the \"docker build\" warning by setting DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0\n  explicitly.\n\n  In order to inject SCC credentials with docker-buildx, users should use\n\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n\n  when doing their builds.\n\nUpdate to Docker 28.3.3-ce. See upstream changelog online at \u003chttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/28/#2833\u003e\n\nSecurity issue fixed:\n\n- CVE-2025-54388: firewalld reload can make published container ports accessible from remote hosts (bsc#1247367)\n\nUpdate to docker-buildx v0.26.1. Upstream changelog: \u003chttps://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.26.1\u003e\n\nUpdate to docker-buildx v0.26.0.

      "CVE": "CVE-2025-54388",
      "Description": "Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. In versions 28.2.0 through 28.3.2, when the firewalld service is reloaded it removes all iptables rules including those created by Docker. While Docker should automatically recreate these rules, versions before 28.3.3 fail to recreate the specific rules that block external access to containers. This means that after a firewalld reload, containers with ports published to localhost (like 127.0.0.1:8080) become accessible from remote machines that have network routing to the Docker bridge, even though they should only be accessible from the host itself. The vulnerability only affects explicitly published ports - unpublished ports remain protected. This issue is fixed in version 28.3.3.",
