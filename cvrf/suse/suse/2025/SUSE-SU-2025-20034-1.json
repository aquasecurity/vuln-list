      "Text": "This update for python-requests fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update to 2.32.2\n  * To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, \n    we've renamed _get_connection to a new public API, get_connection_with_tls_context. Existing \n    custom HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API. get_connection is \n    considered deprecated in all versions of Requests\u003e=2.32.0.\n\n- Update to 2.32.1\n  * Fixed an issue where setting verify=False on the first request from a Session \n    will cause subsequent requests to the same origin to also ignore cert verification, \n    regardless of the value of verify. (bsc#1224788, CVE-2024-35195)\n  * verify=True now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve request time \n    variance between first and subsequent requests.\n  * Requests now supports optional use of character detection (chardet or charset_normalizer) \n    when repackaged or vendored. This enables pip and other projects to minimize their \n    vendoring surface area.\n  * Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 and dropped support for CPython 3.7.\n  * Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system using hatchling.\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-35195",
      "Description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.",
