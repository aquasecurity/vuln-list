Existing\n    custom HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API. get_connection is\n  * Fixed an issue where setting verify=False on the first request from a Session\n    will cause subsequent requests to the same origin to also ignore cert verification,\n  * verify=True now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve request time\n  * Requests now supports optional use of character detection (chardet or charset_normalizer)\n    when repackaged or vendored. This enables pip and other projects to minimize their\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-35195",
      "Description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Prior to 2.32.0, when making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.32.0.",
