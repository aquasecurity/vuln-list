We\nencountered this problem during normal RX in the hns3 driver:\n\n(1) Initially we have three descriptors in the RX queue. The first one\n    allocates PAGE1 through page_pool, and the other two allocate one\n    half of PAGE2 each. Page references look like this:\n\n                RX_BD1 _______ PAGE1\n                RX_BD2 _______ PAGE2\n                RX_BD3 _________/\n\n(2) Handle RX on the first descriptor. Allocate SKB1, eventually added\n    to the receive queue by tcp_queue_rcv().\n\n(3) Handle RX on the second descriptor. Allocate SKB2 and pass it to\n    netif_receive_skb():\n\n    netif_receive_skb(SKB2)\n      ip_rcv(SKB2)\n        SKB3 = skb_clone(SKB2)\n\n    SKB2 and SKB3 share a reference to PAGE2 through\n    skb_shinfo()-\u003edataref. The other ref to PAGE2 is still held by\n    RX_BD3:\n\n                      SKB2 ---+- PAGE2\n                      SKB3 __/   /\n                RX_BD3 _________/\n\n (3b) Now while handling TCP, coalesce SKB3 with SKB1:\n\n      tcp_v4_rcv(SKB3)\n        tcp_try_coalesce(to=SKB1, from=SKB3)    // succeeds\n        kfree_skb_partial(SKB3)\n          skb_release_data(SKB3)                // drops one dataref\n\n                      SKB1 _____ PAGE1\n                           \\____\n                      SKB2 _____ PAGE2\n                                 /\n                RX_BD3 _________/\n\n    In skb_try_coalesce(), __skb_frag_ref() takes a page reference to\n    PAGE2, where it should instead have increased the page_pool frag\n    reference, pp_frag_count. Without coalescing, when releasing both\n    SKB2 and SKB3, a single reference to PAGE2 would be dropped. Now\n    when releasing SKB1 and SKB2, two references to PAGE2 will be\n    dropped, resulting in underflow.\n\n (3c) Drop SKB2:\n\n      af_packet_rcv(SKB2)\n        consume_skb(SKB2)\n          skb_release_data(SKB2)                // drops second dataref\n            page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE2)    // drops one pp_frag_count\n\n                      SKB1 _____ PAGE1\n                           \\____\n                                 PAGE2\n                                 /\n                RX_BD3 _________/\n\n(4) Userspace calls recvmsg()\n    Copies SKB1 and releases it. Since SKB3 was coalesced with SKB1, we\n    release the SKB3 page as well:\n\n    tcp_eat_recv_skb(SKB1)\n      skb_release_data(SKB1)\n        page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE1)\n        page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE2)        // drops second pp_frag_count\n\n(5) PAGE2 is freed, but the third RX descriptor was still using it!\n    In our case this causes IOMMU faults, but it would silently corrupt\n    memory if the IOMMU was disabled.\n\nChange the logic that checks whether pp_recycle SKBs can be coalesced.\nWe still reject differing pp_recycle between 'from' and 'to' SKBs, but\nin order to avoid the situation described above, we also reject\ncoalescing when both 'from' and 'to' are pp_recycled and 'from' is\ncloned.\n\nThe new logic allows coalescing a cloned pp_recycle SKB into a page\nrefcounted one, because in this case the release (4) will drop the right\nreference, the one taken by skb_try_coalesce().",

Since this is slow path we can use proper synchronization via\nlocks.\n\nWhen we are able to cancel a timer (del_timer returns 1) we know there\ncan't be any error handling in progress because the timeout handler hasn't\nexpired yet, thus we can safely decrement the refcounter by one.\n\nIf we are not able to cancel the timer, we know an abort handler is\nrunning.

PAPR also permits the\nhypervisor to discard this SLB entry (because slb_shadow-\u003epersistent is\nonly set to SLB_NUM_BOLTED) although it's not known whether any\nimplementations would do this (KVM does not). So this is an extremely\nunlikely bug, only found by inspection.\n\nFix this by also storing user r13 in a temporary location on the kernel\nstack and don't change the r13 register from kernel r13 until the RI=0\ncritical section that does not fault.\n\nThe SCRATCH0 change is not strictly part of the fix, it's only used in\nthe RI=0 section so it does not have the same problem as the previous\nSCRATCH0 bug.",

This itself seems a bit sketchy, but the real\nproblem with GCC12 is that it is moving the actual reads/writes around\nat will as though they were independent operations when in truth they\nare not, but the compiler can't know that. When looking at the\nassembly dumps for many of these routines its possible to see very\nclean, but not strictly in program order operations occurring as the\ncompiler would be free to do if these weren't actually register\nreads/write operations.\n\nIts possible to suppress the timeout with a liberal bit of dma_mb()'s\nsprinkled around but the device still seems unable to reliably\nsend/receive data. A better plan is to use the safer readl/writel\neverywhere.\n\nSince this partially reverts an older commit, which notes the use of\nthe relaxed variants for performance reasons.

However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight\nibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is\nprogressing.\n\nSince the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which\ncan then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).\n\nWe cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the -\u003eresetting\nbit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the \"back-end\" of a good\nreset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the -\u003eresetting\nbit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to -\u003eresetting being true,\nthe queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit\ntimeouts.\n\nIOW -\u003eresetting is too broad for this purpose. Instead use a new flag\nthat indicates whether or not the queues are active. Only the open/\nreset paths control when the queues are active. ibmvnic_complete_tx()\nand others wake up the queue only if the queue is marked active.\n\nSo we will have:\n\tA. reset/open thread in ibmvnic_cleanup() and __ibmvnic_open()\n\n\t\t-\u003eresetting = true\n\t\t-\u003etx_queues_active = false\n\t\tdisable tx queues\n\t\t...\n\t\t-\u003etx_queues_active = true\n\t\tstart tx queues\n\n\tB.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s: Don't use DSISR for SLB faults\n\nSince commit 46ddcb3950a2 (\"powerpc/mm: Show if a bad page fault on data\nis read or write.\") we use page_fault_is_write(regs-\u003edsisr) in\n__bad_page_fault() to determine if the fault is for a read or write, and\nchange the message printed accordingly.\n\nBut SLB faults, aka Data Segment Interrupts, don't set DSISR (Data\nStorage Interrupt Status Register) to a useful value. All ISA versions\nfrom v2.03 through v3.1 specify that the Data Segment Interrupt sets\nDSISR \"to an undefined value\". As far as I can see there's no mention of\nSLB faults setting DSISR in any BookIV content either.\n\nThis manifests as accesses that should be a read being incorrectly\nreported as writes, for example, using the xmon \"dump\" command:\n\n  0:mon\u003e d 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  5deadbeef0000000\n  [359526.415354][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  [359526.415611][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000010a300\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf400]\n      pc: c00000000010a300: mread+0x90/0x190\n\nIf we disassemble the PC, we see a load instruction:\n\n  0:mon\u003e di c00000000010a300\n  c00000000010a300 89490000      lbz     r10,0(r9)\n\nWe can also see in exceptions-64s.S that the data_access_slb block\ndoesn't set IDSISR=1, which means it doesn't load DSISR into pt_regs. So\nthe value we're using to determine if the fault is a read/write is some\nstale value in pt_regs from a previous page fault.\n\nRework the printing logic to separate the SLB fault case out, and only\nprint read/write in the cases where we can determine it.\n\nThe result looks like eg:\n\n  0:mon\u003e d 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  5deadbeef0000000\n  [  721.779525][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access at 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  [  721.779697][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000014cbe0\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf390]\n\n  0:mon\u003e d 0\n  0000000000000000\n  [  742.793242][    C6] BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0x00000000\n  [  742.793316][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000014cbe0\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf390]",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix UAF due to race between btf_try_get_module and load_module\n\nWhile working on code to populate kfunc BTF ID sets for module BTF from\nits initcall, I noticed that by the time the initcall is invoked, the\nmodule BTF can already be seen by userspace (and the BPF verifier). The\nexisting btf_try_get_module calls try_module_get which only fails if\nmod-\u003estate == MODULE_STATE_GOING, i.e. it can increment module reference\nwhen module initcall is happening in parallel.\n\nCurrently, BTF parsing happens from MODULE_STATE_COMING notifier\ncallback. At this point, the module initcalls have not been invoked.\nThe notifier callback parses and prepares the module BTF, allocates an\nID, which publishes it to userspace, and then adds it to the btf_modules\nlist allowing the kernel to invoke btf_try_get_module for the BTF.\n\nHowever, at this point, the module has not been fully initialized (i.e.\nits initcalls have not finished). The code in module.c can still fail\nand free the module, without caring for other users. However, nothing\nstops btf_try_get_module from succeeding between the state transition\nfrom MODULE_STATE_COMING to MODULE_STATE_LIVE.\n\nThis leads to a use-after-free issue when BPF program loads\nsuccessfully in the state transition, load_module's do_init_module call\nfails and frees the module, and BPF program fd on close calls module_put\nfor the freed module. Future patch has test case to verify we don't\nregress in this area in future.\n\nThere are multiple points after prepare_coming_module (in load_module)\nwhere failure can occur and module loading can return error. We\nillustrate and test for the race using the last point where it can\npractically occur (in module __init function).\n\nAn illustration of the race:\n\nCPU 0                           CPU 1\n\t\t\t  load_module\n\t\t\t    notifier_call(MODULE_STATE_COMING)\n\t\t\t      btf_parse_module\n\t\t\t      btf_alloc_id\t// Published to userspace\n\t\t\t      list_add(\u0026btf_mod-\u003elist, btf_modules)\n\t\t\t    mod-\u003einit(...)\n...\t\t\t\t^\nbpf_check\t\t        |\ncheck_pseudo_btf_id             |\n  btf_try_get_module            |\n    returns true                |  ...\n...                             |  module __init in progress\nreturn prog_fd                  |  ...\n...                             V\n\t\t\t    if (ret \u003c 0)\n\t\t\t      free_module(mod)\n\t\t\t    ...\nclose(prog_fd)\n ...\n bpf_prog_free_deferred\n  module_put(used_btf.mod) // use-after-free\n\nWe fix this issue by setting a flag BTF_MODULE_F_LIVE, from the notifier\ncallback when MODULE_STATE_LIVE state is reached for the module, so that\nwe return NULL from btf_try_get_module for modules that are not fully\nformed. Since try_module_get already checks that module is not in\nMODULE_STATE_GOING state, and that is the only transition a live module\ncan make before being removed from btf_modules list, this is enough to\nclose the race and prevent the bug.\n\nA later selftest patch crafts the race condition artifically to verify\nthat it has been fixed, and that verifier fails to load program (with\nENXIO).\n\nLastly, a couple of comments:\n\n 1. Even if this race didn't exist, it seems more appropriate to only\n    access resources (ksyms and kfuncs) of a fully formed module which\n    has been initialized completely.\n\n 2. This patch was born out of need for synchronization against module\n    initcall for the next patch, so it is needed for correctness even\n    without the aforementioned race condition. The BTF resources\n    initialized by module initcall are set up once and then only looked\n    up, so just waiting until the initcall has finished ensures correct\n    behavior.",

POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,\nbut it is not an explicit requirement[2]:\n\n    The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is\n    associated with the process being started by one of the exec\n    functions.\n...\nInterestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],\nbut there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.\nHopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]\nof this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.\n\nThis issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5].\"\n\nWhile the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be\nmostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL\n(or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]\nexisting userspace programs.\n\nThe next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and\nadjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0\nseems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.\n\nAccount for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an\nempty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so\nuserspace has some notice about the change:\n\n    process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added\n\nAdditionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220127000724.15106-1-ariadne@dereferenced.org/\n[2] https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/exec.html\n[3] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408\n[4] https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt\n[5] https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/176\n[6] https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=execve%5C+*%5C%28%5B%5E%2C%5D%2B%2C+*NULL\u0026literal=0\n[7] https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=execlp%3F%5Cs*%5C%28%5B%5E%2C%5D%2B%2C%5Cs*NULL\u0026literal=0\n[8] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220131144352.GE16385@xsang-OptiPlex-9020/",

The following is from\nresctl-bench protection scenario which emulates isolating a web server like\nworkload from a memory bomb run on an iocost configuration which should\nyield a reasonable level of protection.\n\n  # cat /sys/block/nvme2n1/device/model\n  Samsung SSD 970 PRO 512GB\n  # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.model\n  259:0 ctrl=user model=linear rbps=834913556 rseqiops=93622 rrandiops=102913 wbps=618985353 wseqiops=72325 wrandiops=71025\n  # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.qos\n  259:0 enable=1 ctrl=user rpct=95.00 rlat=18776 wpct=95.00 wlat=8897 min=60.00 max=100.00\n  # resctl-bench -m 29.6G -r out.json run protection::scenario=mem-hog,loops=1\n  ...\n  Memory Hog Summary\n  ==================\n\n  IO Latency: R p50=242u:336u/2.5m p90=794u:1.4m/7.5m p99=2.7m:8.0m/62.5m max=8.0m:36.4m/350m\n              W p50=221u:323u/1.5m p90=709u:1.2m/5.5m p99=1.5m:2.5m/9.5m max=6.9m:35.9m/350m\n\n  Isolation and Request Latency Impact Distributions:\n\n                min   p01   p05   p10   p25   p50   p75   p90   p95   p99   max  mean stdev\n  isol%       15.90 15.90 15.90 40.05 57.24 59.07 60.01 74.63 74.63 90.35 90.35 58.12 15.82\n  lat-imp%        0     0     0     0     0  4.55 14.68 15.54 233.5 548.1 548.1 53.88 143.6\n\n  Result: isol=58.12:15.82% lat_imp=53.88%:143.6 work_csv=100.0% missing=3.96%\n\nThe isolation result of 58.12% is close to what this device would show\nwithout any IO control.\n\nFix it by introducing a new flag BIO_QOS_MERGED to mark merged bios and\ncalling rq_qos_done_bio() on them too. For consistency and clarity, rename\nBIO_TRACKED to BIO_QOS_THROTTLED. The flag checks are moved into\nrq_qos_done_bio() so that it's next to the code paths that set the flags.\n\nWith the patch applied, the above same benchmark shows:\n\n  # resctl-bench -m 29.6G -r out.json run protection::scenario=mem-hog,loops=1\n  ...\n  Memory Hog Summary\n  ==================\n\n  IO Latency: R p50=123u:84.4u/985u p90=322u:256u/2.5m p99=1.6m:1.4m/9.5m max=11.1m:36.0m/350m\n              W p50=429u:274u/995u p90=1.7m:1.3m/4.5m p99=3.4m:2.7m/11.5m max=7.9m:5.9m/26.5m\n\n  Isolation and Request Latency Impact Distributions:\n\n                min   p01   p05   p10   p25   p50   p75   p90   p95   p99   max  mean stdev\n  isol%       84.91 84.91 89.51 90.73 92.31 94.49 96.36 98.04 98.71 100.0 100.0 94.42  2.81\n  lat-imp%        0     0     0     0     0  2.81  5.73 11.11 13.92 17.53 22.61  4.10  4.68\n\n  Result: isol=94.42:2.81% lat_imp=4.10%:4.68 work_csv=58.34% missing=0%",

Although we\napply the restrictions to input parameters, it's based only on the\nhw_params of the underlying PCM device.  Since the PCM OSS layer\nallocates a temporary buffer for the data conversion, the size may\nbecome unexpectedly large when more channels or higher rates is given;\nin the reported case, it went over INT_MAX, hence it hits WARN_ON().\n\nThis patch is an attempt to avoid such an overflow and an allocation\nfor too large buffers.  First off, it adds the limit of 1MB as the\nupper bound for period bytes.  This must be large enough for all use\ncases, and we really don't want to handle a larger temporary buffer\nthan this size.  The size check is performed at two places, where the\noriginal period bytes is calculated and where the plugin buffer size\nis calculated.\n\nIn addition, the driver uses array_size() and array3_size() for\nmultiplications to catch overflows for the converted period size and\nbuffer bytes.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbcache: avoid journal no-space deadlock by reserving 1 journal bucket\n\nThe journal no-space deadlock was reported time to time. Such deadlock\ncan happen in the following situation.\n\nWhen all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy\nwrite I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load\nall active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is\ncalled journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree\nnode and results btree node split, new journal request might be\ntriggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node\nsplit, then the root node record in cache device super block will be\nupgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no\nspace in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal\nbucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This\nis one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens.\n\nThe solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in\nrun time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during\ncache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then\nthe journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for\njournal no-space deadlock to happen anymore.\n\nThis patch adds a new member \"bool do_reserve\" in struct journal, it is\ninititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to\n1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in\nrun_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to\nallocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check\nwhether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only\n1 free journal bucket and journal-\u003edo_reserve is 1 (true), the last\nbucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate\nno free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try\nnext time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By\nthis method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time.\n\nDuring the cache set registration, journal-\u003edo_reserve is 0 (false), so\nthe reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock.",

For USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN, if this function fails because of\nlock is still in used, next time when unlink invokes this function, it\nwill return succeed, and then unlink will remove inode and dentry if lock\nis not in used(file closed), but the dlm lock is still linked in dlm lock\nresource, then when bast come in, it will trigger a panic due to\nuser-after-free.  See the following panic call trace.  To fix this,\nUSER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN should be reverted if fail.  And also error should\nbe returned if USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN is set to let user know that unlink\nfail.\n\nFor the case of ocfs2_dlm_unlock failure, besides USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN,\nUSER_LOCK_BUSY is also required to be cleared.  Even though spin lock is\nreleased in between, but USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN is still set, for\nUSER_LOCK_BUSY, if before every place that waits on this flag,\nUSER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN is checked to bail out, that will make sure no flow\nwaits on the busy flag set by user_dlm_destroy_lock(), then we can\nsimplely revert USER_LOCK_BUSY when ocfs2_dlm_unlock fails.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iolatency: Fix inflight count imbalances and IO hangs on offline\n\niolatency needs to track the number of inflight IOs per cgroup. As this\ntracking can be expensive, it is disabled when no cgroup has iolatency\nconfigured for the device. To ensure that the inflight counters stay\nbalanced, iolatency_set_limit() freezes the request_queue while manipulating\nthe enabled counter, which ensures that no IO is in flight and thus all\ncounters are zero.\n\nUnfortunately, iolatency_set_limit() isn't the only place where the enabled\ncounter is manipulated. iolatency_pd_offline() can also dec the counter and\ntrigger disabling. As this disabling happens without freezing the q, this\ncan easily happen while some IOs are in flight and thus leak the counts.\n\nThis can be easily demonstrated by turning on iolatency on an one empty\ncgroup while IOs are in flight in other cgroups and then removing the\ncgroup. Note that iolatency shouldn't have been enabled elsewhere in the\nsystem to ensure that removing the cgroup disables iolatency for the whole\ndevice.\n\nThe following keeps flipping on and off iolatency on sda:\n\n  echo +io \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control\n  while true; do\n      mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/test\n      echo '8:0 target=100000' \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/test/io.latency\n      sleep 1\n      rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test\n      sleep 1\n  done\n\nand there's concurrent fio generating direct rand reads:\n\n  fio --name test --filename=/dev/sda --direct=1 --rw=randread \\\n      --runtime=600 --time_based --iodepth=256 --numjobs=4 --bs=4k\n\nwhile monitoring with the following drgn script:\n\n  while True:\n    for css in css_for_each_descendant_pre(prog['blkcg_root'].css.address_of_()):\n        for pos in hlist_for_each(container_of(css, 'struct blkcg', 'css').blkg_list):\n            blkg = container_of(pos, 'struct blkcg_gq', 'blkcg_node')\n            pd = blkg.pd[prog['blkcg_policy_iolatency'].plid]\n            if pd.value_() == 0:\n                continue\n            iolat = container_of(pd, 'struct iolatency_grp', 'pd')\n            inflight = iolat.rq_wait.inflight.counter.value_()\n            if inflight:\n                print(f'inflight={inflight} {disk_name(blkg.q.disk).decode(\"utf-8\")} '\n                      f'{cgroup_path(css.cgroup).decode(\"utf-8\")}')\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nThe monitoring output looks like the following:\n\n  inflight=1 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=1 sda /user.slice\n  ...\n  inflight=14 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=13 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=17 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=15 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=18 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=17 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=20 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=19 sda /user.slice \u003c- fio stopped, inflight stuck at 19\n  inflight=19 sda /user.slice\n  inflight=19 sda /user.slice\n\nIf a cgroup with stuck inflight ends up getting throttled, the throttled IOs\nwill never get issued as there's no completion event to wake it up leading\nto an indefinite hang.\n\nThis patch fixes the bug by unifying enable handling into a work item which\nis automatically kicked off from iolatency_set_min_lat_nsec() which is\ncalled from both iolatency_set_limit() and iolatency_pd_offline() paths.\nPunting to a work item is necessary as iolatency_pd_offline() is called\nunder spinlocks while freezing a request_queue requires a sleepable context.\n\nThis also simplifies the code reducing LOC sans the comments and avoids the\nunnecessary freezes which were happening whenever a cgroup's latency target\nis newly set or cleared.",

This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by\nsyz-bot below:\n\n       CPU0              CPU1                    CPU2\n       ----              ----                    ----\n                         lock(console_owner);\n                                                 lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n  lock(\u0026port-\u003elock);\n                         lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n                                                 lock(\u0026port-\u003elock);\n  lock(console_owner);\n\nAs commit dbdda842fe96 (\"printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to\nload balance console writes\") said, such deadlock can be prevented by\nusing printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section\nguarded by the port-\u003elock).  But there are too many printk() on the\nkmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing\nprintk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant.\n\nTherefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so\nthat printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be\navoided.\n\nSyzbot reported the following lockdep error:\n\n======================================================\nWARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n5.4.143-00237-g08ccc19a-dirty #10 Not tainted\n------------------------------------------------------\nsyz-executor.4/29420 is trying to acquire lock:\nffffffff8aedb2a0 (console_owner){....}-{0:0}, at: console_trylock_spinning kernel/printk/printk.c:1752 [inline]\nffffffff8aedb2a0 (console_owner){....}-{0:0}, at: vprintk_emit+0x2ca/0x470 kernel/printk/printk.c:2023\n\nbut task is already holding lock:\nffff8880119c9158 (\u0026port-\u003elock){-.-.}-{2:2}, at: pty_write+0xf4/0x1f0 drivers/tty/pty.c:120\n\nwhich lock already depends on the new lock.\n\nthe existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:\n\n-\u003e #2 (\u0026port-\u003elock){-.-.}-{2:2}:\n       __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n       _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x35/0x50 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159\n       tty_port_tty_get drivers/tty/tty_port.c:288 [inline]          \t\t\u003c-- lock(\u0026port-\u003elock);\n       tty_port_default_wakeup+0x1d/0xb0 drivers/tty/tty_port.c:47\n       serial8250_tx_chars+0x530/0xa80 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1767\n       serial8250_handle_irq.part.0+0x31f/0x3d0 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1854\n       serial8250_handle_irq drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1827 [inline] \t\u003c-- lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n       serial8250_default_handle_irq+0xb2/0x220 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1870\n       serial8250_interrupt+0xfd/0x200 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:126\n       __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x109/0xa50 kernel/irq/handle.c:156\n       [...]\n\n-\u003e #1 (\u0026port_lock_key){-.-.}-{2:2}:\n       __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n       _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x35/0x50 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159\n       serial8250_console_write+0x184/0xa40 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:3198\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c-- lock(\u0026port_lock_key);\n       call_console_drivers kernel/printk/printk.c:1819 [inline]\n       console_unlock+0x8cb/0xd00 kernel/printk/printk.c:2504\n       vprintk_emit+0x1b5/0x470 kernel/printk/printk.c:2024\t\t\t\u003c-- lock(console_owner);\n       vprintk_func+0x8d/0x250 kernel/printk/printk_safe.c:394\n       printk+0xba/0xed kernel/printk/printk.c:2084\n       register_console+0x8b3/0xc10 kernel/printk/printk.c:2829\n       univ8250_console_init+0x3a/0x46 drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c:681\n       console_init+0x49d/0x6d3 kernel/printk/printk.c:2915\n       start_kernel+0x5e9/0x879 init/main.c:713\n       secondary_startup_64+0xa4/0xb0 arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S:241\n\n-\u003e #0 (console_owner){....}-{0:0}:\n       [...]\n       lock_acquire+0x127/0x340 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4734\n       console_trylock_spinning kernel/printk/printk.c:1773 \n---truncated---",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nath10k: skip ath10k_halt during suspend for driver state RESTARTING\n\nDouble free crash is observed when FW recovery(caused by wmi\ntimeout/crash) is followed by immediate suspend event. The FW recovery\nis triggered by ath10k_core_restart() which calls driver clean up via\nath10k_halt(). When the suspend event occurs between the FW recovery,\nthe restart worker thread is put into frozen state until suspend completes.\nThe suspend event triggers ath10k_stop() which again triggers ath10k_halt()\nThe double invocation of ath10k_halt() causes ath10k_htt_rx_free() to be\ncalled twice(Note: ath10k_htt_rx_alloc was not called by restart worker\nthread because of its frozen state), causing the crash.\n\nTo fix this, during the suspend flow, skip call to ath10k_halt() in\nath10k_stop() when the current driver state is ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.\nAlso, for driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING, call\nath10k_wait_for_suspend() in ath10k_stop(). This is because call to\nath10k_wait_for_suspend() is skipped later in\n[ath10k_halt() \u003e ath10k_core_stop()] for the driver state\nATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.\n\nThe frozen restart worker thread will be cancelled during resume when the\ndevice comes out of suspend.\n\nBelow is the crash stack for reference:\n\n[  428.469167] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  428.469180] kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:4150!\n[  428.469193] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n[  428.469219] Workqueue: events_unbound async_run_entry_fn\n[  428.469230] RIP: 0010:kfree+0x319/0x31b\n[  428.469241] RSP: 0018:ffffa1fac015fc30 EFLAGS: 00010246\n[  428.469247] RAX: ffffedb10419d108 RBX: ffff8c05262b0000\n[  428.469252] RDX: ffff8c04a8c07000 RSI: 0000000000000000\n[  428.469256] RBP: ffffa1fac015fc78 R08: 0000000000000000\n[  428.469276] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  428.469285] Call Trace:\n[  428.469295]  ? dma_free_attrs+0x5f/0x7d\n[  428.469320]  ath10k_core_stop+0x5b/0x6f\n[  428.469336]  ath10k_halt+0x126/0x177\n[  428.469352]  ath10k_stop+0x41/0x7e\n[  428.469387]  drv_stop+0x88/0x10e\n[  428.469410]  __ieee80211_suspend+0x297/0x411\n[  428.469441]  rdev_suspend+0x6e/0xd0\n[  428.469462]  wiphy_suspend+0xb1/0x105\n[  428.469483]  ? name_show+0x2d/0x2d\n[  428.469490]  dpm_run_callback+0x8c/0x126\n[  428.469511]  ? name_show+0x2d/0x2d\n[  428.469517]  __device_suspend+0x2e7/0x41b\n[  428.469523]  async_suspend+0x1f/0x93\n[  428.469529]  async_run_entry_fn+0x3d/0xd1\n[  428.469535]  process_one_work+0x1b1/0x329\n[  428.469541]  worker_thread+0x213/0x372\n[  428.469547]  kthread+0x150/0x15f\n[  428.469552]  ? pr_cont_work+0x58/0x58\n[  428.469558]  ? kthread_blkcg+0x31/0x31\n\nTested-on: QCA6174 hw3.2 PCI WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00288-QCARMSWPZ-1",

Information about the error is printed to dmesg in\ncompat_arm_syscall() -\u003e arm64_notify_die() -\u003e arm64_force_sig_fault() -\u003e\narm64_show_signal().\n\narm64_show_signal() interprets a non-zero value for\ncurrent-\u003ethread.fault_code as an exception syndrome and displays the\nmessage associated with the ESR_ELx.EC field (bits 31:26).\ncurrent-\u003ethread.fault_code is set in compat_arm_syscall() -\u003e\narm64_notify_die() with the bad syscall number instead of a valid ESR_ELx\nvalue. This means that the ESR_ELx.EC field has the value that the user set\nfor the syscall number and the kernel can end up printing bogus exception\nmessages*. For example, for the syscall number 0x68000000, which evaluates\nto ESR_ELx.EC value of 0x1A (ESR_ELx_EC_FPAC) the kernel prints this error:\n\n[   18.349161] syscall[300]: unhandled exception: ERET/ERETAA/ERETAB, ESR 0x68000000, Oops - bad compat syscall(2) in syscall[10000+50000]\n[   18.350639] CPU: 2 PID: 300 Comm: syscall Not tainted 5.18.0-rc1 #79\n[   18.351249] Hardware name: Pine64 RockPro64 v2.0 (DT)\n[..]\n\nwhich is misleading, as the bad compat syscall has nothing to do with\npointer authentication.\n\nStop arm64_show_signal() from printing exception syndrome information by\nhaving compat_arm_syscall() set the ESR_ELx value to 0, as it has no\nmeaning for an invalid system call number. The example above now becomes:\n\n[   19.935275] syscall[301]: unhandled exception: Oops - bad compat syscall(2) in syscall[10000+50000]\n[   19.936124] CPU: 1 PID: 301 Comm: syscall Not tainted 5.18.0-rc1-00005-g7e08006d4102 #80\n[   19.936894] Hardware name: Pine64 RockPro64 v2.0 (DT)\n[..]\n\nwhich although shows less information because the syscall number,\nwrongfully advertised as the ESR value, is missing, it is better than\nshowing plainly wrong information.

This change prevents the oopses\nseen when a PCIe link flap occurs on an igc adapter.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncgroup: Use separate src/dst nodes when preloading css_sets for migration\n\nEach cset (css_set) is pinned by its tasks. When we're moving tasks around\nacross csets for a migration, we need to hold the source and destination\ncsets to ensure that they don't go away while we're moving tasks about. This\nis done by linking cset-\u003emg_preload_node on either the\nmgctx-\u003epreloaded_src_csets or mgctx-\u003epreloaded_dst_csets list. Using the\nsame cset-\u003emg_preload_node for both the src and dst lists was deemed okay as\na cset can't be both the source and destination at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately, this overloading becomes problematic when multiple tasks are\ninvolved in a migration and some of them are identity noop migrations while\nothers are actually moving across cgroups. For example, this can happen with\nthe following sequence on cgroup1:\n\n #1\u003e mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b\n #2\u003e echo $$ \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs\n #3\u003e RUN_A_COMMAND_WHICH_CREATES_MULTIPLE_THREADS \u0026\n #4\u003e PID=$!\n #5\u003e echo $PID \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b/tasks\n #6\u003e echo $PID \u003e /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs\n\nthe process including the group leader back into a. In this final migration,\nnon-leader threads would be doing identity migration while the group leader\nis doing an actual one.\n\nAfter #3, let's say the whole process was in cset A, and that after #4, the\nleader moves to cset B. Then, during #6, the following happens:\n\n 1. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on B for the leader.\n\n 2. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on A for the other threads.\n\n 3. cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst() is called. It scans the src list.\n\n 4. It notices that B wants to migrate to A, so it tries to A to the dst\n    list but realizes that its -\u003emg_preload_node is already busy.\n\n 5. and then it notices A wants to migrate to A as it's an identity\n    migration, it culls it by list_del_init()'ing its -\u003emg_preload_node and\n    putting references accordingly.\n\n 6. The rest of migration takes place with B on the src list but nothing on\n    the dst list.\n\nThis means that A isn't held while migration is in progress. If all tasks\nleave A before the migration finishes and the incoming task pins it, the\ncset will be destroyed leading to use-after-free.\n\nThis is caused by overloading cset-\u003emg_preload_node for both src and dst\npreload lists. We wanted to exclude the cset from the src list but ended up\ninadvertently excluding it from the dst list too.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by separating out cset-\u003emg_preload_node into\n-\u003emg_src_preload_node and -\u003emg_dst_preload_node, so that the src and dst\npreloadings don't interfere with each other.",

Finally, there is a race window where command\nsubmission/compeletion can try to pull/return elements from/to an event\npool that is being deleted or already has been deleted due to the lack of\nhost state around freeing/allocating resources.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: ftrace: consistently handle PLTs.\n\nSometimes it is necessary to use a PLT entry to call an ftrace\ntrampoline. This is handled by ftrace_make_call() and ftrace_make_nop(),\nwith each having *almost* identical logic, but this is not handled by\nftrace_modify_call() since its introduction in commit:\n\n  3b23e4991fb66f6d (\"arm64: implement ftrace with regs\")\n\nDue to this, if we ever were to call ftrace_modify_call() for a callsite\nwhich requires a PLT entry for a trampoline, then either:\n\na) If the old addr requires a trampoline, ftrace_modify_call() will use\n   an out-of-range address to generate the 'old' branch instruction.\n   This will result in warnings from aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm() and\n   ftrace_modify_code(), and no instructions will be modified. As\n   ftrace_modify_call() will return an error, this will result in\n   subsequent internal ftrace errors.\n\nb) If the old addr does not require a trampoline, but the new addr does,\n   ftrace_modify_call() will use an out-of-range address to generate the\n   'new' branch instruction. This will result in warnings from\n   aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm(), and ftrace_modify_code() will replace\n   the 'old' branch with a BRK. This will result in a kernel panic when\n   this BRK is later executed.\n\nPractically speaking, case (a) is vastly more likely than case (b), and\ntypically this will result in internal ftrace errors that don't\nnecessarily affect the rest of the system. This can be demonstrated with\nan out-of-tree test module which triggers ftrace_modify_call(), e.g.\n\n| # insmod test_ftrace.ko\n| test_ftrace: Function test_function raw=0xffffb3749399201c, callsite=0xffffb37493992024\n| branch_imm_common: offset out of range\n| branch_imm_common: offset out of range\n| ------------[ ftrace bug ]------------\n| ftrace failed to modify\n| [\u003cffffb37493992024\u003e] test_function+0x8/0x38 [test_ftrace]\n|  actual:   1d:00:00:94\n| Updating ftrace call site to call a different ftrace function\n| ftrace record flags: e0000002\n|  (2) R\n|  expected tramp: ffffb374ae42ed54\n| ------------[ cut here ]------------\n| WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 165 at kernel/trace/ftrace.c:2085 ftrace_bug+0x280/0x2b0\n| Modules linked in: test_ftrace(+)\n| CPU: 0 PID: 165 Comm: insmod Not tainted 5.19.0-rc2-00002-g4d9ead8b45ce #13\n| Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n| pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n| pc : ftrace_bug+0x280/0x2b0\n| lr : ftrace_bug+0x280/0x2b0\n| sp : ffff80000839ba00\n| x29: ffff80000839ba00 x28: 0000000000000000 x27: ffff80000839bcf0\n| x26: ffffb37493994180 x25: ffffb374b0991c28 x24: ffffb374b0d70000\n| x23: 00000000ffffffea x22: ffffb374afcc33b0 x21: ffffb374b08f9cc8\n| x20: ffff572b8462c000 x19: ffffb374b08f9000 x18: ffffffffffffffff\n| x17: 6c6c6163202c6331 x16: ffffb374ae5ad110 x15: ffffb374b0d51ee4\n| x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 3435646532346561 x12: 3437336266666666\n| x11: 203a706d61727420 x10: 6465746365707865 x9 : ffffb374ae5149e8\n| x8 : 336266666666203a x7 : 706d617274206465 x6 : 00000000fffff167\n| x5 : ffff572bffbc4a08 x4 : 00000000fffff167 x3 : 0000000000000000\n| x2 : 0000000000000000 x1 : ffff572b84461e00 x0 : 0000000000000022\n| Call trace:\n|  ftrace_bug+0x280/0x2b0\n|  ftrace_replace_code+0x98/0xa0\n|  ftrace_modify_all_code+0xe0/0x144\n|  arch_ftrace_update_code+0x14/0x20\n|  ftrace_startup+0xf8/0x1b0\n|  register_ftrace_function+0x38/0x90\n|  test_ftrace_init+0xd0/0x1000 [test_ftrace]\n|  do_one_initcall+0x50/0x2b0\n|  do_init_module+0x50/0x1f0\n|  load_module+0x17c8/0x1d64\n|  __do_sys_finit_module+0xa8/0x100\n|  __arm64_sys_finit_module+0x2c/0x3c\n|  invoke_syscall+0x50/0x120\n|  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xdc/0x100\n|  do_el0_svc+0x3c/0xd0\n|  el0_svc+0x34/0xb0\n|  el0t_64_sync_handler+0xbc/0x140\n|  el0t_64_sync+0x18c/0x190\n| ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nWe can solve this by consistently determining whether to use a PLT entry\nfor an address.\n\nNote that since (the earlier) commit:\n\n  f1a54ae9\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth.

[0]\n\nThe workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers\nin non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

There are\nmyriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,\nand others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.\n\nFor guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure\ntracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is\nnecessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing\nis enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).  Per the SDM:\n\n  If the logical processor is operating with Intel PT enabled (if\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn = 1) at the time of VM entry, the \"load\n  IA32_RTIT_CTL\" VM-entry control must be 0.\n\nOn the host side, KVM doesn't validate the guest CPUID configuration\nprovided by userspace, and even worse, uses the guest configuration to\ndecide what MSRs to save/load at VM-Enter and VM-Exit.  E.g. configuring\nguest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware\nwill result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,\nwhich generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential\ndeadlock, etc.",

For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID\ngreater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally\nchosen to be hidden from the user.\n\nHiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next\nCapability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the\ncapability after the one that should be hidden.\n\nThe special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden\nis handled differently because there is no previous capability that can\nbe modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed\nwhile leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and\nleaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.\n\nHowever, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done\nproperly if the capability is unknown, as struct\nvfio_pci_core_device-\u003epci_config_map is set to the capability ID during\ninitialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when\nused in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and\nto an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.\n\nFix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater\nthan PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct\nread only access instead of the ecap_perms array.\n\nNote that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can\nexceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which\nare already checked before).\n\n[1]\n\nWARNING: CPU: 118 PID: 5329 at drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci_config.c:1900 vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\nCPU: 118 UID: 0 PID: 5329 Comm: simx-qemu-syste Not tainted 6.12.0+ #1\n(snip)\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n ? __warn+0x8d/0x140\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x395/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n ? vfio_pci_config_rw+0x244/0x430 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_rw+0x101/0x1b0 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_pci_core_read+0x1d/0x30 [vfio_pci_core]\n vfio_device_fops_read+0x27/0x40 [vfio]\n vfs_read+0xbd/0x340\n ? vfio_device_fops_unl_ioctl+0xbb/0x740 [vfio]\n ? __rseq_handle_notify_resume+0xa4/0x4b0\n __x64_sys_pread64+0x96/0xc0\n x64_sys_call+0x1c3d/0x20d0\n do_syscall_64+0x4d/0x120\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",

One of these cases is a loop device by\nusing ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWhile this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of\nhfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write\nout-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the\nlatter function reads a different io_size.\n\nUsing a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the\npurposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between\nHFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the\nmax between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not\ninitialized.\n\nTested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024\nand 4096.\n\nThe produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:\n\n[  419.944641] ==================================================================\n[  419.945655] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.946703] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800721fc00 by task repro/10678\n[  419.947612]\n[  419.947846] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10678 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00008-gdf56e0f2f3ca #84\n[  419.949007] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[  419.950035] Call Trace:\n[  419.950384]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  419.950676]  dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x78\n[  419.951212]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.951830]  print_report+0x14c/0x49e\n[  419.952361]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x267/0x278\n[  419.952979]  ? kmem_cache_debug_flags+0xc/0x1d\n[  419.953561]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.954231]  kasan_report+0x89/0xb0\n[  419.954748]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955367]  hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955948]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x10/0x10\n[  419.956618]  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x59/0x1a9\n[  419.957214]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1a/0x2e\n[  419.957772]  hfsplus_fill_super+0x348/0x1590\n[  419.958355]  ? hlock_class+0x4c/0x109\n[  419.958867]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.959499]  ? __pfx_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.960006]  ? lock_acquire+0x3e2/0x454\n[  419.960532]  ? bdev_name.constprop.0+0xce/0x243\n[  419.961129]  ? __pfx_bdev_name.constprop.0+0x10/0x10\n[  419.961799]  ? pointer+0x3f0/0x62f\n[  419.962277]  ? __pfx_pointer+0x10/0x10\n[  419.962761]  ? vsnprintf+0x6c4/0xfba\n[  419.963178]  ? __pfx_vsnprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.963621]  ? setup_bdev_super+0x376/0x3b3\n[  419.964029]  ? snprintf+0x9d/0xd2\n[  419.964344]  ? __pfx_snprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.964675]  ? lock_acquired+0x45c/0x5e9\n[  419.965016]  ? set_blocksize+0x139/0x1c1\n[  419.965381]  ? sb_set_blocksize+0x6d/0xae\n[  419.965742]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966179]  mount_bdev+0x12f/0x1bf\n[  419.966512]  ? __pfx_mount_bdev+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966886]  ? vfs_parse_fs_string+0xce/0x111\n[  419.967293]  ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.967702]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.968073]  legacy_get_tree+0x104/0x178\n[  419.968414]  vfs_get_tree+0x86/0x296\n[  419.968751]  path_mount+0xba3/0xd0b\n[  419.969157]  ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.969594]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x1e2/0x260\n[  419.970311]  do_mount+0x99/0xe0\n[  419.970630]  ? __pfx_do_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.971008]  __do_sys_mount+0x199/0x1c9\n[  419.971397]  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x135\n[  419.971761]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[  419.972233] RIP: 0033:0x7c3cb812972e\n[  419.972564] Code: 48 8b 0d f5 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d c2 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\n[  419.974371] RSP: 002b:00007ffe30632548 EFLAGS: 00000286 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n[  419.975048] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe306328d8 RCX: 00007c3cb812972e\n[  419.975701] RDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000020000c80 RDI:\n---truncated---",

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp.

This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.\nThis also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag\ncode, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is\ncalled there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.",

During the network boot process, when trying to search for the configuration file, grub copies data from a user controlled environment variable into an internal buffer using the grub_strcpy() function.

In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1003",

Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.",
