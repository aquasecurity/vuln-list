See upstream changelog online at  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.2\u0026gt;.\n  Some notable changelogs from the last update:\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.0\u0026gt;\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.18.0\u0026gt;\n- Update to Go 1.22.\n\n- Add a new toggle file /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable which allows users to\n  disable the SUSEConnect integration with Docker (which creates special mounts\n  in /run/secrets to allow container-suseconnect to authenticate containers\n  with registries on registered hosts). bsc#1231348 bsc#1232999\n  In order to disable these mounts, just do\n    echo 0 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. In order to re-enable them, just do\n    echo 1 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Add docker-integration-tests-devel subpackage for building and running the\n  upstream Docker integration tests on machines to test that Docker works\n  properly. Users should not install this package.\n- docker-rpmlintrc updated to include allow-list for all of the integration\n  tests package, since it contains a bunch of stuff that wouldn't normally be\n  allowed.\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u0026gt;\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. bsc#1231348\n  bsc#1232999\n\n- Add %{_sysconfdir}/audit/rules.d to filelist.\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic \u0026quot;docker build\u0026quot; has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. bsc#1230331\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  bsc#1230333\n- Make some minor name macro updates to help with the docker-stable package\n  fork.\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615\u0026gt;\n  bsc#1230294\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n  * 0006-bsc1221916-update-to-patched-buildkit-version-to-fix.patch\n  * 0007-bsc1214855-volume-use-AtomicWriteFile-to-save-volume.patch\n  * cli-0001-docs-include-required-tools-in-source-tree.patch\n\nPackage expat was updated:\n\n- security update- added patches\n  fix CVE-2024-50602 [bsc#1232579], DoS via XML_ResumeParser\n  + expat-CVE-2024-50602.patch\n\n- Security fix (bsc#1229932, CVE-2024-45492): detect integer\n  overflow in function nextScaffoldPart\n  * Added expat-CVE-2024-45492.patch\n- Security fix (bsc#1229931, CVE-2024-45491): detect integer\n  overflow in dtdCopy\n  * Added expat-CVE-2024-45491.patch\n- Security fix (bsc#1229930, CVE-2024-45490): reject negative\n  len for XML_ParseBuffer\n  * Added expat-CVE-2024-45490.patch\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2024-52533.patch: fix a single byte buffer overflow  (boo#1233282 CVE-2024-52533 glgo#GNOME/glib#3461).\n\n- Add glib2-gdbusmessage-cache-arg0.patch: cache the arg0 value in\n  a dbus message.

As consequence the klp_symbols variable is set, enabling\n  kernel-default-livepatch-devel on both SLE and openSUSE.\n  The current rules to avoid enabling the package exclude openSUSE\n  Tumbleweed alone, which doesn't makes sense for now. Enabling\n  kernel-default-livepatch-devel on TW makes it easier to test the\n  creation of kernel livepatches of the next SLE versions.\n- commit fd0b293\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/Input-aiptek-properly-check-endpoint-type.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48836 bsc#1227989).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/NFC-port100-fix-use-after-free-in-port100_send_compl.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48857 bsc#1228005).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/NFSD-Fix-the-behavior-of-READ-near-OFFSET_MAX.patch\n  (bsc#1195957 CVE-2022-48827 bsc#1228037).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/drm-vrr-Set-VRR-capable-prop-only-if-it-is-attached-.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48843 bsc#1228066).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/gianfar-ethtool-Fix-refcount-leak-in-gfar_get_ts_inf.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48856 bsc#1228004).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/ibmvnic-don-t-release-napi-in-__ibmvnic_open.patch\n  (bsc#1195668 ltc#195811 CVE-2022-48811 bsc#1227928).\n- Update patches.suse/iwlwifi-fix-use-after-free.patch (git-fixes\n  CVE-2022-48787 bsc#1227932).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/msft-hv-2525-Drivers-hv-vmbus-Fix-memory-leak-in-vmbus_add_channe.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48775 bsc#1227924).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/mtd-rawnand-gpmi-don-t-leak-PM-reference-in-error-pa.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48778 bsc#1227935).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/net-mlx5-Fix-a-race-on-command-flush-flow.patch\n  (jsc#SLE-15172 CVE-2022-48858 bsc#1228006).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/nvme-fix-a-possible-use-after-free-in-controller-res.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48790 bsc#1227941).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/nvme-rdma-fix-possible-use-after-free-in-transport-e.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48788 bsc#1227952).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/nvme-tcp-fix-possible-use-after-free-in-transport-er.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48789 bsc#1228000).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/s390-cio-verify-the-driver-availability-for-path_event-call\n  (bsc#1195928 LTC#196418 CVE-2022-48798 bsc#1227945).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/scsi-mpt3sas-Page-fault-in-reply-q-processing\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48835 bsc#1228060).\n- Update patches.suse/scsi-myrs-Fix-crash-in-error-case.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48824 bsc#1227964).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/scsi-qedf-Fix-refcount-issue-when-LOGO-is-received-during-TMF.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48823 bsc#1228045).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/staging-gdm724x-fix-use-after-free-in-gdm_lte_rx.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48851 bsc#1227997).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/usb-gadget-Fix-use-after-free-bug-by-not-setting-udc.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48838 bsc#1227988).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/usb-gadget-rndis-prevent-integer-overflow-in-rndis_s.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48837 bsc#1227987).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/usb-usbtmc-Fix-bug-in-pipe-direction-for-control-tra.patch\n  (git-fixes CVE-2022-48834 bsc#1228062).\n  Add CVE references.\n- commit fe68d20\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/0001-ocfs2-fix-DIO-failure-due-to-insufficient-transactio.patch\n  (bsc#1216834 CVE-2024-42077 bsc#1228516).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/fs-proc-task_mmu.c-don-t-read-mapcount-for-migration-entry.patch\n  (CVE-2023-1582 bsc#1209636 CVE-2022-48802 bsc#1227942).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/net-packet-fix-slab-out-of-bounds-access-in-packet_r.patch\n  (CVE-2022-20368 bsc#1202346 CVE-2022-48839 bsc#1227985).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/net-usb-ax88179_178a-Fix-out-of-bounds-accesses-in-R.patch\n  (bsc#1196018 CVE-2022-28748 CVE-2022-2964 CVE-2022-48805\n  bsc#1227969).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/swiotlb-fix-info-leak-with-DMA_FROM_DEVICE.patch\n  (CVE-2022-0854 bsc#1196823 CVE-2022-48853 bsc#1228015).\n- Update\n  patches.suse/tls-fix-use-after-free-on-failed-backlog-decryption.patch\n  (CVE-2024-26583 CVE-2024-26584 bsc#1220185 bsc#1220186\n  CVE-2024-26800 bsc#1222728).\n  Add CVE references.\n- commit 92b372a\n\n- ax25: Fix refcount imbalance on inbound connections\n  (CVE-2024-40910 bsc#1227832).\n- commit 69e2646\n\n- kernel-binary: generate and install compile_commands.json (bsc#1228971)\n  This file contains the command line options used to compile every C file.\n  It's useful for the livepatching team.\n- commit 8efe375\n\n- nvme-tcp: fix UAF when detecting digest errors (bsc#1223948\n  CVE-2022-48686).\n- commit e5510ce\n\n- Update patches.suse/usb-f_fs-Fix-use-after-free-for-epfile.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1228040 CVE-2022-48822).\n- commit 2c8d4da\n\n- packaging: Add case-sensitive perl option parsing\n  A recent change in Getopt::Long [1]:\n  Changes in version 2.55\n  -

The input URL is passed in a header, but sent back as\n  raw data in the frames body.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipc/mqueue, msg, sem: avoid relying on a stack reference past its expiry\n\ndo_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with a stack local address.  The\nsender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send.\n\nThis leads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive\ncall might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid\naddress, causing the following crash:\n\n  RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60\n  Call Trace:\n   __x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490\n   do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9\n  RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343\n\nThe race occurs as:\n\n1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `struct\n   ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it\n   holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not\n   been overwritten.\n\n2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info-\u003ee_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and\n   do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call\n   __pipelined_op.\n\n3. Sender calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(\u0026this-\u003estate,\n   STATE_READY).  Here is where the race window begins.  (`this` is\n   `ewq_addr`.)\n\n4. If the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it\n   will see `state == STATE_READY` and break.\n\n5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed\n   to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's\n   stack.  (Although the address may not get overwritten until another\n   function happens to touch it, which means it can persist around for an\n   indefinite time.)\n\n6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a\n   `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass to\n   the wake_q_add_safe call.  In the lucky case where nothing has\n   overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr-\u003etask` is the right task_struct.\n   In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a\n   bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.\n\ndo_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after\nsetting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.\nChange __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's\ntask_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this`\nwhich sits on the receiver's stack.\n\nAs Manfred pointed out, the race potentially also exists in\nipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.  Fix\nthose in the same way.",

So this a UAF.\n\nIn terms of how to patch the problem, we can refer to igbvf_remove() and\ndelete the entry before `adapter-\u003erx_ring`.\n\nThe KASAN logs are as follows:\n\n[   35.126075] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450\n[   35.127170] Read of size 8 at addr ffff88810126d990 by task modprobe/366\n[   35.128360]\n[   35.128643] CPU: 1 PID: 366 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #14\n[   35.129789] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.12.0-59-gc9ba5276e321-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n[   35.131749] Call Trace:\n[   35.132199]  dump_stack_lvl+0x59/0x7b\n[   35.132865]  print_address_description+0x7c/0x3b0\n[   35.133707]  ? free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450\n[   35.134378]  __kasan_report+0x160/0x1c0\n[   35.135063]  ? free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450\n[   35.135738]  kasan_report+0x4b/0x70\n[   35.136367]  free_netdev+0x1fd/0x450\n[   35.137006]  igbvf_probe+0x121d/0x1a10 [igbvf]\n[   35.137808]  ? igbvf_vlan_rx_add_vid+0x100/0x100 [igbvf]\n[   35.138751]  local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0\n[   35.139461]  pci_device_probe+0x37e/0x6c0\n[   35.165526]\n[   35.165806] Allocated by task 366:\n[   35.166414]  ____kasan_kmalloc+0xc4/0xf0\n[   35.167117]  foo_kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x3c/0x50 [igbvf]\n[   35.168078]  igbvf_probe+0x9c5/0x1a10 [igbvf]\n[   35.168866]  local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0\n[   35.169565]  pci_device_probe+0x37e/0x6c0\n[   35.179713]\n[   35.179993] Freed by task 366:\n[   35.180539]  kasan_set_track+0x4c/0x80\n[   35.181211]  kasan_set_free_info+0x1f/0x40\n[   35.181942]  ____kasan_slab_free+0x103/0x140\n[   35.182703]  kfree+0xe3/0x250\n[   35.183239]  igbvf_probe+0x1173/0x1a10 [igbvf]\n[   35.184040]  local_pci_probe+0x13c/0x1f0",

The client as\n\u003e a result indefinitely retries the request.\n\nThe Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all\nNFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a\nREAD.\n\nInstead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed\nand return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent\nthe client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to\nbe consistent with Solaris NFS servers.\n\nNote that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These\nmust be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit\ntype cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks\nagainst sb-\u003es_maxbytes do not work properly.",

As a cgroup interface file can't be\nrenamed, it's safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a\nregular cgroup file.  Also, as these cgroup interface files can't be\nremoved before the directory, it's safe to access the parent too.\n\nPrior to 347c4a874710 (\"memcg: remove cgroup_event-\u003ecft\"), there was a\ncall to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular\ncgroupfs file before further accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from\n__file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped\nthe file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the\ninvarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against\nrenames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.\n\nFix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().  Now that\ncgroupfs is implemented through kernfs, checking the file operations needs\nto go through a layer of indirection.  Instead, let's check the superblock\nand dentry type.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2022-49006",
      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removed\n\nAfter 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the \"type\" field\nof the event then uses the first type number that is available (not\ncurrently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of the\nbinary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them to\nlogic that can parse the binary blob.\n\nThe issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced and\nis in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it is\ndynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamic\nevent is created that has the same number that new event's logic on\nparsing the binary blob will be used.\n\nTo show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing\n # for i in `seq 65536`; do\n     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' \u003e kprobe_events\n # done\n\nFor every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events will\nremove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) and\nincrease the type number to the next available on until the type number\nreaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After it\nreaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks for\nthe next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that number\nis then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,\nonce the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event in\nthat loop will remain the same.\n\nNow that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reuse\nthe previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.\nAfter the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads the\ndo_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer.\n\n # echo 1 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n # cat /etc/passwd \u003e /dev/null\n # cat trace\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849620: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849838: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849880: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n # echo 0 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n\nNow if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string:\n\n # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' \u003e kprobe_events\n\nAnd now we can the trace:\n\n # cat trace\n        sendmail-1942    [002] .....   530.136320: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930817: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930961: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934278: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934563: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"���������������������������������������\n---truncated---",

A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality.

HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

Due to the lengthy analysis of\nthe pcrypt_aead01 function call, I'll describe the problem scenario\nusing a simplified model:\n\nSuppose there's a user of padata named `user_function` that adheres to\nthe padata requirement of calling `padata_free_shell` after `serial()`\nhas been invoked, as demonstrated in the following code:\n\n```c\nstruct request {\n    struct padata_priv padata;\n    struct completion *done;\n};\n\nvoid parallel(struct padata_priv *padata) {\n    do_something();\n}\n\nvoid serial(struct padata_priv *padata) {\n    struct request *request = container_of(padata,\n    \t\t\t\tstruct request,\n\t\t\t\tpadata);\n    complete(request-\u003edone);\n}\n\nvoid user_function() {\n    DECLARE_COMPLETION(done)\n    padata-\u003eparallel = parallel;\n    padata-\u003eserial = serial;\n    padata_do_parallel();\n    wait_for_completion(\u0026done);\n    padata_free_shell();\n}\n```\n\nIn the corresponding padata.c file, there's the following code:\n\n```c\nstatic void padata_serial_worker(struct work_struct *serial_work) {\n    ...\n    cnt = 0;\n\n    while (!list_empty(\u0026local_list)) {\n        ...\n        padata-\u003eserial(padata);\n        cnt++;\n    }\n\n    local_bh_enable();\n\n    if (refcount_sub_and_test(cnt, \u0026pd-\u003erefcnt))\n        padata_free_pd(pd);\n}\n```\n\nBecause of the high system load and the accumulation of unexecuted\nsoftirq at this moment, `local_bh_enable()` in padata takes longer\nto execute than usual. Subsequently, when accessing `pd-\u003erefcnt`,\n`pd` has already been released by `padata_free_shell()`, resulting\nin a UAF issue with `pd-\u003erefcnt`.\n\nThe fix is straightforward: add `refcount_dec_and_test` before calling\n`padata_free_pd` in `padata_free_shell`.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix overrunning reservations in ringbuf\n\nThe BPF ring buffer internally is implemented as a power-of-2 sized circular\nbuffer, with two logical and ever-increasing counters: consumer_pos is the\nconsumer counter to show which logical position the consumer consumed the\ndata, and producer_pos which is the producer counter denoting the amount of\ndata reserved by all producers.\n\nEach time a record is reserved, the producer that \"owns\" the record will\nsuccessfully advance producer counter. In user space each time a record is\nread, the consumer of the data advanced the consumer counter once it finished\nprocessing. Both counters are stored in separate pages so that from user\nspace, the producer counter is read-only and the consumer counter is read-write.\n\nOne aspect that simplifies and thus speeds up the implementation of both\nproducers and consumers is how the data area is mapped twice contiguously\nback-to-back in the virtual memory, allowing to not take any special measures\nfor samples that have to wrap around at the end of the circular buffer data\narea, because the next page after the last data page would be first data page\nagain, and thus the sample will still appear completely contiguous in virtual\nmemory.\n\nEach record has a struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr { u32 len; u32 pg_off; } header for\nbook-keeping the length and offset, and is inaccessible to the BPF program.\nHelpers like bpf_ringbuf_reserve() return `(void *)hdr + BPF_RINGBUF_HDR_SZ`\nfor the BPF program to use. Bing-Jhong and Muhammad reported that it is however\npossible to make a second allocated memory chunk overlapping with the first\nchunk and as a result, the BPF program is now able to edit first chunk's\nheader.\n\nFor example, consider the creation of a BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF map with size\nof 0x4000. Next, the consumer_pos is modified to 0x3000 /before/ a call to\nbpf_ringbuf_reserve() is made. This will allocate a chunk A, which is in\n[0x0,0x3008], and the BPF program is able to edit [0x8,0x3008]. Now, lets\nallocate a chunk B with size 0x3000. This will succeed because consumer_pos\nwas edited ahead of time to pass the `new_prod_pos - cons_pos \u003e rb-\u003emask`\ncheck. Chunk B will be in range [0x3008,0x6010], and the BPF program is able\nto edit [0x3010,0x6010]. Due to the ring buffer memory layout mentioned\nearlier, the ranges [0x0,0x4000] and [0x4000,0x8000] point to the same data\npages. This means that chunk B at [0x4000,0x4008] is chunk A's header.\nbpf_ringbuf_submit() / bpf_ringbuf_discard() use the header's pg_off to then\nlocate the bpf_ringbuf itself via bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec(). Once chunk\nB modified chunk A's header, then bpf_ringbuf_commit() refers to the wrong\npage and could cause a crash.\n\nFix it by calculating the oldest pending_pos and check whether the range\nfrom the oldest outstanding record to the newest would span beyond the ring\nbuffer size. If that is the case, then reject the request. We've tested with\nthe ring buffer benchmark in BPF selftests (./benchs/run_bench_ringbufs.sh)\nbefore/after the fix and while it seems a bit slower on some benchmarks, it\nis still not significantly enough to matter.",

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage\n\nWhen opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is\ndone against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file\npointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file\nmetadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how\nto set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the\npermissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.\n\nFor example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not\nset-id:\n\n---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nto set-id and non-executable:\n\n---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nit is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been\ndisallowed.\n\nWhile this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been\nobserved (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating\nthe setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being\nworld-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid\nbit. For example, \"chmod o-x,u+s target\" makes \"target\" executable only\nby uid \"root\" and gid \"cdrom\", while also becoming setuid-root:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nbecomes:\n\n-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nBut racing the chmod means users without group \"cdrom\" membership can\nget the permission to execute \"target\" just before the chmod, and when\nthe chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the\nsetuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of \"only cdrom\ngroup members can setuid to root\".\n\nRe-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata\nhas changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,\nbut until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a\nfull inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that\nthis is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",

      "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.",

Analysis in light\nof the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking\ndiscipline work.\n\nIn staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered\nto be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case\n\nAs Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal\nmemory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the\nmapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of\na 'struct page'.\n\nThat's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to\nmess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always\neventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit\nlifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the\nerror handling in the wrong order.\n\nIn particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store\nbefore the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have\nstale dangling PTE entries.\n\nTo make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial\npfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling.",

This can happen during unmount because we don't wait\nfor any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against\nthe cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.\n\nFix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call\nkthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.\n\nThe stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880272a8a18 by task kworker/u8:3/52\n\n  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 52 Comm: kworker/u8:3 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc1-syzkaller #0\n  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 09/13/2024\n  Workqueue: btrfs-fixup btrfs_work_helper\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x241/0x360 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n   print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:377 [inline]\n   print_report+0x169/0x550 mm/kasan/report.c:488\n   kasan_report+0x143/0x180 mm/kasan/report.c:601\n   __lock_acquire+0x77/0x2050 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5065\n   lock_acquire+0x1ed/0x550 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5825\n   __raw_spin_lock_irqsave include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:110 [inline]\n   _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0xd5/0x120 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:162\n   class_raw_spinlock_irqsave_constructor include/linux/spinlock.h:551 [inline]\n   try_to_wake_up+0xb0/0x1480 kernel/sched/core.c:4154\n   btrfs_writepage_fixup_worker+0xc16/0xdf0 fs/btrfs/inode.c:2842\n   btrfs_work_helper+0x390/0xc50 fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:314\n   process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3229 [inline]\n   process_scheduled_works+0xa63/0x1850 kernel/workqueue.c:3310\n   worker_thread+0x870/0xd30 kernel/workqueue.c:3391\n   kthread+0x2f0/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n\n  Allocated by task 2:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   unpoison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:319 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_alloc+0x66/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:345\n   kasan_slab_alloc include/linux/kasan.h:247 [inline]\n   slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:4086 [inline]\n   slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:4135 [inline]\n   kmem_cache_alloc_node_noprof+0x16b/0x320 mm/slub.c:4187\n   alloc_task_struct_node kernel/fork.c:180 [inline]\n   dup_task_struct+0x57/0x8c0 kernel/fork.c:1107\n   copy_process+0x5d1/0x3d50 kernel/fork.c:2206\n   kernel_clone+0x223/0x880 kernel/fork.c:2787\n   kernel_thread+0x1bc/0x240 kernel/fork.c:2849\n   create_kthread kernel/kthread.c:412 [inline]\n   kthreadd+0x60d/0x810 kernel/kthread.c:765\n   ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n\n  Freed by task 61:\n   kasan_save_stack mm/kasan/common.c:47 [inline]\n   kasan_save_track+0x3f/0x80 mm/kasan/common.c:68\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x40/0x50 mm/kasan/generic.c:579\n   poison_slab_object mm/kasan/common.c:247 [inline]\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x59/0x70 mm/kasan/common.c:264\n   kasan_slab_free include/linux/kasan.h:230 [inline]\n   slab_free_h\n---truncated---",

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------\u003e+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",

      "Description": "Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.",

This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie \"./venv/bin/python\") are not affected.",
