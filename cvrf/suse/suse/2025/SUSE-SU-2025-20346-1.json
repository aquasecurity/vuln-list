      "Text": "This update for python311 fixes the following issues:\n\n- Updated to 3.11.12:\n  - gh-131809: Updated bundled libexpat to 2.7.1\n  - gh-131261: Upgraded to libexpat 2.7.0\n  - CVE-2025-0938: Fixed functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` \n    accepting domain names including square brackets (bsc#1236705)\n  - gh-121284: Fixed bug in the folding of rfc2047 encoded-words\n    when flattening an email message using a modern email\n    policy. Previously when an encoded-word was too long for\n    a line, it would be decoded, split across lines, and\n    re-encoded. But commas and other special characters in the\n    original text could be left unencoded and unquoted. This\n    could theoretically be used to spoof header lines using a\n    carefully constructed encoded-word if the resulting rendered\n    email was transmitted or re-parsed.\n  - gh-80222: Fixed bug in the folding of quoted strings\n    when flattening an email message using a modern email\n    policy. Previously when a quoted string was folded so that\n    it spanned more than one line, the surrounding quotes and\n    internal escapes would be omitted. This could theoretically\n    be used to spoof header lines using a carefully constructed\n    quoted string if the resulting rendered email was transmitted\n    or re-parsed.\n  - gh-119511: Fixed a potential denial of service in the imaplib\n    module. When connecting to a malicious server, it could\n    cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. On many\n    systems this is harmless as unused virtual memory is only\n    a mapping, but if this hit a virtual address size limit\n    it could lead to a MemoryError or other process crash. On\n    unusual systems or builds where all allocated memory is\n    touched and backed by actual ram or storage it could’ve\n    consumed resources doing so until similarly crashing.\n  - gh-127257: In ssl, system call failures that OpenSSL reports\n    using ERR_LIB_SYS are now raised as OSError.\n  - gh-121277: Writers of CPython’s documentation can now use\n    next as the version for the versionchanged, versionadded,\n    deprecated directives.\n  - gh-106883: Disabled GC during the _PyThread_CurrentFrames()\n    and _PyThread_CurrentExceptions() calls to avoid the\n    interpreter to deadlock.\n",

      "Description": "The Python standard library functions `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `urlparse` accepted domain names that included square brackets which isn't valid according to RFC 3986. Square brackets are only meant to be used as delimiters for specifying IPv6 and IPvFuture hosts in URLs. This could result in differential parsing across the Python URL parser and other specification-compliant URL parsers.",
