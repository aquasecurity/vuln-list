      "Text": "This image update for google/sle-micro-5-1-byos-v20250130-x86-64 contains the following changes:\nPackage 000release-packages:SUSE-MicroOS-release was updated:\n\nPackage aaa_base was updated:\n\n- Add patch git-50-845b509c9a005340a0455cb8a7fe084d1b8f1946.patch  * Add mc helpers for both tcsh and bash resources (boo#1203617)\n\nPackage containerd was updated:\n\n- Update to containerd v1.7.23. Upstream release notes:  \u0026lt;https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.23\u0026gt;\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-BUILD-SLE12-revert-btrfs-depend-on-kernel-UAPI-inste.patch\n\n- Update to containerd v1.7.22. Upstream release notes:\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.22\u0026gt;\n- Bump minimum Go version to 1.22.\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-BUILD-SLE12-revert-btrfs-depend-on-kernel-UAPI-inste.patch\n\nPackage docker was updated:\n\n- Update docker-buildx to v0.19.2. See upstream changelog online at  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.2\u0026gt;.\n  Some notable changelogs from the last update:\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.0\u0026gt;\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.18.0\u0026gt;\n- Update to Go 1.22.\n\n- Add a new toggle file /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable which allows users to\n  disable the SUSEConnect integration with Docker (which creates special mounts\n  in /run/secrets to allow container-suseconnect to authenticate containers\n  with registries on registered hosts). bsc#1231348 bsc#1232999\n  In order to disable these mounts, just do\n    echo 0 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. In order to re-enable them, just do\n    echo 1 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Add docker-integration-tests-devel subpackage for building and running the\n  upstream Docker integration tests on machines to test that Docker works\n  properly. Users should not install this package.\n- docker-rpmlintrc updated to include allow-list for all of the integration\n  tests package, since it contains a bunch of stuff that wouldn't normally be\n  allowed.\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u0026gt;\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. bsc#1231348\n  bsc#1232999\n\n- Add %{_sysconfdir}/audit/rules.d to filelist.\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic \u0026quot;docker build\u0026quot; has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. bsc#1230331\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  bsc#1230333\n- Make some minor name macro updates to help with the docker-stable package\n  fork.\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615\u0026gt;\n  bsc#1230294\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n  * 0006-bsc1221916-update-to-patched-buildkit-version-to-fix.patch\n  * 0007-bsc1214855-volume-use-AtomicWriteFile-to-save-volume.patch\n  * cli-0001-docs-include-required-tools-in-source-tree.patch\n\nPackage kernel-default was updated:\n\n- smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key (bsc#1234921,  CVE-2024-53179).\n- commit 3b35702\n\n- smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key (bsc#1234921,\n  CVE-2024-53179).\n- commit c3470ed\n\n- scsi: sg: Fix slab-use-after-free read in sg_release()\n  (CVE-2024-56631 bsc#1235480).\n- commit 39e048d\n\n- 9p/xen: fix release of IRQ (CVE-2024-56704 bsc#1235584).\n- commit 19bad6c\n\n- NFSv4.0: Fix a use-after-free problem in the asynchronous open()\n  (CVE-2024-53173 bsc#1234891).\n- commit a94e553\n\n- Bluetooth: L2CAP: do not leave dangling sk pointer on error\n  in l2cap_sock_create() (CVE-2024-56605 bsc#1235061).\n- commit 20f98a1\n\n- media: s5p_cec: limit msg.len to CEC_MAX_MSG_SIZE\n  (CVE-2022-49035 bsc#1215304).\n- commit da4fde6\n\n- net: mana: Increase the DEF_RX_BUFFERS_PER_QUEUE to 1024\n  (bsc#1235246).\n- commit 4fbdfe2\n\n- wifi: mwifiex: Fix memcpy() field-spanning write warning in\n  mwifiex_config_scan() (CVE-2024-56539 bsc#1234963).\n- commit ee60ab9\n\n- vfio/pci: Properly hide first-in-list PCIe extended capability\n  (bsc#1235004 CVE-2024-53214).\n- commit bf247b6\n\n- Bluetooth: RFCOMM: avoid leaving dangling sk pointer in\n  rfcomm_sock_alloc() (bsc#1235056 CVE-2024-56604).\n- commit 59e9445\n\n- Bluetooth: Consolidate code around sk_alloc into a helper\n  function (bsc#1235056 CVE-2024-56604).\n  Refresh\n  patches.suse/Bluetooth-SCO-Fix-UAF-on-sco_sock_timeout.patch.\n- commit 8ac1fe3\n\n- Bluetooth: hci_sock: purge socket queues in the destruct()\n  callback (bsc#1235056 CVE-2024-56604).\n- commit 5fdf3eb\n\n- hfsplus: don't query the device logical block size multiple\n  times (bsc#1235073 CVE-2024-56548).\n- commit 14dfa57\n\n- wifi: ath9k: add range check for conn_rsp_epid in\n  htc_connect_service() (CVE-2024-53156 bsc#1234846).\n- commit 4be0730\n\n- ALSA: 6fire: Release resources at card release (CVE-2024-53239\n  bsc#1235054).\n- commit 21c90ac\n\n- NFSD: Prevent a potential integer overflow (CVE-2024-53146\n  bsc#1234853).\n- commit eb512aa\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/Bluetooth-hci_event-Align-BR-EDR-JUST_WORKS-paring-w.patch\n  (git-fixes bsc#1230697 CVE-2024-8805 CVE-2024-53144\n  bsc#1234690).\n- commit 192af19\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/net-nfc-llcp-Add-lock-when-modifying-device-list.patch\n  (CVE-2023-52524 bsc#1220937 bsc#1220927).\n- commit 6f47795\n\n- xen/netfront: fix crash when removing device (XSA-465\n  CVE-2024-53240 bsc#1234281).\n- commit b0ad117\n\n- Bluetooth: hci_event: Align BR/EDR JUST_WORKS paring with LE\n  (git-fixes, bsc#1230697, CVE-2024-8805).\n- commit da492aa\n\n- Update\n  patches.suse/initramfs-avoid-filename-buffer-overrun.patch\n  (CVE-2024-53142 bsc#1232436).\n- commit 160662b\n\nPackage cryptsetup was updated:\n\n- luksFormat succeeds despite creating corrupt device [bsc#1234273]  * Add a better warning if luksFormat ends with image without any space for data.\n  * Print warning early if LUKS container is too small for activation.\n  * Add patches:\n  - cryptsetup-Add-a-better-warning-if-luksFormat-no-space-for-data.patch\n  - cryptsetup-Print-warning-early-if-LUKS-container-is-too-small-for-activation.patch\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Url: queryparams without value should not have a trailing \u0026quot;=\u0026quot;.- version 17.35.16 (35)\n\n- Url query part: `=` is a safe char in value (bsc#1234304)\n- RpmDb: Recognize rpmdb.sqlite as database file (#593)\n- Fix typo (fixes #592)\n- cmake: check location of fcgi header and adjust include\n  accordingly.

      "Description": "OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go. A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

      "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches.

We still use the\nmax between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not\ninitialized.\n\nTested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024\nand 4096.\n\nThe produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:\n\n[  419.944641] ==================================================================\n[  419.945655] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.946703] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800721fc00 by task repro/10678\n[  419.947612]\n[  419.947846] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10678 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00008-gdf56e0f2f3ca #84\n[  419.949007] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n[  419.950035] Call Trace:\n[  419.950384]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  419.950676]  dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x78\n[  419.951212]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.951830]  print_report+0x14c/0x49e\n[  419.952361]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0x267/0x278\n[  419.952979]  ? kmem_cache_debug_flags+0xc/0x1d\n[  419.953561]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.954231]  kasan_report+0x89/0xb0\n[  419.954748]  ? hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955367]  hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x659/0xa0a\n[  419.955948]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_read_wrapper+0x10/0x10\n[  419.956618]  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x59/0x1a9\n[  419.957214]  ? _raw_spin_unlock+0x1a/0x2e\n[  419.957772]  hfsplus_fill_super+0x348/0x1590\n[  419.958355]  ? hlock_class+0x4c/0x109\n[  419.958867]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.959499]  ? __pfx_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.960006]  ? lock_acquire+0x3e2/0x454\n[  419.960532]  ? bdev_name.constprop.0+0xce/0x243\n[  419.961129]  ? __pfx_bdev_name.constprop.0+0x10/0x10\n[  419.961799]  ? pointer+0x3f0/0x62f\n[  419.962277]  ? __pfx_pointer+0x10/0x10\n[  419.962761]  ? vsnprintf+0x6c4/0xfba\n[  419.963178]  ? __pfx_vsnprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.963621]  ? setup_bdev_super+0x376/0x3b3\n[  419.964029]  ? snprintf+0x9d/0xd2\n[  419.964344]  ? __pfx_snprintf+0x10/0x10\n[  419.964675]  ? lock_acquired+0x45c/0x5e9\n[  419.965016]  ? set_blocksize+0x139/0x1c1\n[  419.965381]  ? sb_set_blocksize+0x6d/0xae\n[  419.965742]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_fill_super+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966179]  mount_bdev+0x12f/0x1bf\n[  419.966512]  ? __pfx_mount_bdev+0x10/0x10\n[  419.966886]  ? vfs_parse_fs_string+0xce/0x111\n[  419.967293]  ? __pfx_vfs_parse_fs_string+0x10/0x10\n[  419.967702]  ? __pfx_hfsplus_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.968073]  legacy_get_tree+0x104/0x178\n[  419.968414]  vfs_get_tree+0x86/0x296\n[  419.968751]  path_mount+0xba3/0xd0b\n[  419.969157]  ? __pfx_path_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.969594]  ? kmem_cache_free+0x1e2/0x260\n[  419.970311]  do_mount+0x99/0xe0\n[  419.970630]  ? __pfx_do_mount+0x10/0x10\n[  419.971008]  __do_sys_mount+0x199/0x1c9\n[  419.971397]  do_syscall_64+0xd0/0x135\n[  419.971761]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n[  419.972233] RIP: 0033:0x7c3cb812972e\n[  419.972564] Code: 48 8b 0d f5 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48 83 c8 ff c3 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 f3 0f 1e fa 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 8b 0d c2 46 0d 00 f7 d8 64 89 01 48\n[  419.974371] RSP: 002b:00007ffe30632548 EFLAGS: 00000286 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n[  419.975048] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe306328d8 RCX: 00007c3cb812972e\n[  419.975701] RDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000020000c80 RDI:\n---truncated---",

The kref_put() call may\ndecrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup\nthrough sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work\nvia sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.\n\nAfter kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may\nreference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a\nslab-use-after-free error.\n\nMove the kref_put(\u0026sfp-\u003ef_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the\nopen_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:\n\n - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is\n   decremented.\n\n - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and\n   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the\n   mutex handling in sg_release().\n\nThe fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper\nsequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the\nrisk of use-after-free errors in sg_release().",
