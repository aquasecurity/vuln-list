      "Text": "This update fixes the following issues:\n\ngolang-github-prometheus-prometheus was updated from version 2.45.6 to 2.53.3 (jsc#PED-11649):\n\n- Security issues fixed:\n  * CVE-2024-51744: Updated golang-jwt to version 5.0 to fix bad error\n    handling (bsc#1232970)\n\n- Highlights of other changes:\n  * Performance: \n    + Significant enhancements to PromQL execution speed, TSDB operations (especially querying and compaction) and \n      remote write operations.\n    + Default GOGC value lowered to 75 for better memory management. \n    + Option to limit memory usage from dropped targets added.\n  * New Features:\n    + Experimental OpenTelemetry ingestion.\n    + Automatic memory limit handling.\n    + Native histogram support, including new functions, UI enhancements, and improved scraping.\n    + Improved alerting features, such as relabeling rules for AlertmanagerConfig and a new query_offset option.\n    + Expanded service discovery options with added metadata and support for new services.\n    + New promtool commands for PromQL formatting, label manipulation, metric pushing, and OpenMetrics dumping.\n  * Bug Fixes: \n    + Numerous fixes across scraping, API, TSDB, PromQL, and service discovery.\n  * For a detailed list of changes consult the package changelog or \n    https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/compare/v2.45.6...v2.53.3\n\ngolang-github-prometheus-promu was updated to version 0.17.0:\n\n- Added codesign utility function\n\ngrafana was updated from version 9.5.18 to 10.4.13 (jsc#PED-11591,jsc#PED-11649):\n\n- Security issues fixed:\n  * CVE-2024-45337: Prevent possible misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback by upgrading \n    golang.org/x/crypto (bsc#1234554)\n  * CVE-2023-3128: Fixed authentication bypass using Azure AD OAuth (bsc#1212641)\n  * CVE-2023-6152: Add email verification when updating user email (bsc#1219912)\n  * CVE-2024-6837: Fixed potential data source permission escalation (bsc#1236301)\n  * CVE-2024-8118: Fixed permission on external alerting rule write endpoint (bsc#1231024)\n\n- Potential breaking changes in version 10:\n  * In panels using the `extract fields` transformation, where one\n    of the extracted names collides with one of the already\n    existing ields, the extracted field will be renamed.\n  * For the existing backend mode users who have table\n    visualization might see some inconsistencies on their panels.\n    We have updated the table column naming. This will\n    potentially affect field transformations and/or field\n    overrides. To resolve this either: update transformation or\n    field override.\n  * For the existing backend mode users who have Transformations\n    with the `time` field, might see their transformations are\n    not working. Those panels that have broken transformations\n    will fail to render. This is because we changed the field\n    key. To resolve this either: Remove the affected panel and\n    re-create it; Select the `Time` field again; Edit the `time`\n    field as `Time` for transformation in `panel.json` or\n    `dashboard.json` \n  * The following data source permission endpoints have been removed:\n    `GET /datasources/:datasourceId/permissions`\n    `POST /api/datasources/:datasourceId/permissions`\n    `DELETE /datasources/:datasourceId/permissions`\n    `POST /datasources/:datasourceId/enable-permissions`\n    `POST /datasources/:datasourceId/disable-permissions`\n    + Please use the following endpoints instead:\n      `GET /api/access-control/datasources/:uid` for listing data\n       source permissions\n      `POST /api/access-control/datasources/:uid/users/:id`,\n      `POST /api/access-control/datasources/:uid/teams/:id` and\n      `POST /api/access-control/datasources/:uid/buildInRoles/:id` \n      for adding or removing data source permissions\n  * If you are using Terraform Grafana provider to manage data source permissions, you will need to upgrade your\n    provider.\n  * For the existing backend mode users who have table visualization might see some inconsistencies on their panels. \n    We have updated the table column naming. This will potentially affect field transformations and/or field overrides.\n  * The deprecated `/playlists/{uid}/dashboards` API endpoint has been removed. \n    Dashboard information can be retrieved from the `/dashboard/...` APIs.\n  * The `PUT /api/folders/:uid` endpoint no more supports modifying the folder's `UID`\n  * Removed all components for the old panel header design.\n  * Please review https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/breaking-changes/breaking-changes-v10-3/\n    for more details\n  * OAuth role mapping enforcement: This change impacts GitHub,\n    Gitlab, Okta, and Generic OAuth. To avoid overriding manually\n    set roles, enable the skip_org_role_sync option in the\n    Grafana configuration for your OAuth provider before\n    upgrading\n  * Angular has been deprecated\n  * Grafana legacy alerting has been deprecated\n  * API keys are migrating to service accounts\n  * The experimental \u0026#8220;dashboard previews\u0026#8221; feature is removed\n  * Usernames are now case-insensitive by default\n  * Grafana OAuth integrations do not work anymore with email lookups\n  * The \u0026#8220;Alias\u0026#8221; field in the CloudWatch data source is removed\n  * Athena data source plugin must be updated to version \u0026gt;=2.9.3\n  * Redshift data source plugin must be updated to version \u0026gt;=1.8.3\n  * DoiT International BigQuery plugin no longer supported\n  * Please review https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/breaking-changes/breaking-changes-v10-0\n    for more details\n\n- This update brings many new features, enhancements and fixes highlighted at:\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-4/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-3/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-2/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-1/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-0/\n\nspacecmd was updated to version 5.0.11-0:\n\n- Updated translation strings\n\nsupportutils-plugin-salt was updated to version 1.2.3:\n\n- Adjusted requirements for plugin to allow compatibility with supportutils 3.2.9 release (bsc#1235145)\n- Provide backwards-compatible scripts version\n\nsupportutils-plugin-susemanager-client was updated to version 5.0.4-0:\n\n- Adjusted requirements for plugin to allow compatibility with supportutils 3.2.9 release (bsc#1235145)\n\nuyuni-tools was updated from version 0.1.23-0 to 0.1.27-0:\n\n- Security issues fixed:\n  * CVE-2024-22037: Use podman secret to store the database credentials (bsc#1231497)\n- Other changes and bugs fixed:\n  * Version 0.1.27-0\n    + Bump the default image tag to 5.0.3\n    + IsInstalled function fix\n    + Run systemctl daemon-reload after changing the container image config (bsc#1233279)\n    + Coco-replicas-upgrade\n    + Persist search server indexes (bsc#1231759)\n    + Sync deletes files during migration (bsc#1233660)\n    + Ignore coco and hub images when applying PTF if they are not ailable (bsc#1229079)\n    + Add --registry back to mgrpxy (bsc#1233202)\n    + Only add java.hostname on migrated server if not present\n    + Consider the configuration file to detect the coco or hub api images should be pulled (bsc#1229104)\n    + Only raise an error if cloudguestregistryauth fails for PAYG (bsc#1233630)\n    + Add registry.suse.com login to mgradm upgrade podman list (bsc#1234123)\n  * Version 0.1.26-0\n    + Ignore all zypper caches during migration (bsc#1232769)\n    + Use the uyuni network for all podman containers (bsc#1232817)\n  * Version 0.1.25-0\n    + Don't migrate enabled systemd services, recreate them (bsc#1232575)\n    + Redact JSESSIONID and pxt-session-cookie values from logs and\n      console output (bsc#1231568)\n",

      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",

      "Description": "golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.",
