      "Text": "This update for freetype2 fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to 2.13.2:\n\n  * Some  fields in the `FT_Outline` structure have been changed\n    from signed to unsigned type, which better reflects the actual\n    usage. It is also an additional means to protect against\n    malformed input.\n  * Rare double-free crashes in the cache subsystem have been fixed.\n  * Excessive stack allocation in the autohinter has been fixed.\n  * The B/W  rasterizer has received a major upkeep that results in\n    large performance improvements.  The rendering speed has\n    increased and even doubled for very complex glyphs.\n",
