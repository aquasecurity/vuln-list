      "Text": "This update for grafana fixes the following issues:\n\ngrafana was updated from version 9.5.18 to 10.4.13 (jsc#PED-11591,jsc#PED-11649):\n\n- Security issues fixed:\n  * CVE-2024-45337: Prevent possible misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback by upgrading \n    golang.org/x/crypto (bsc#1234554)\n  * CVE-2023-3128: Fixed authentication bypass using Azure AD OAuth (bsc#1212641)\n  * CVE-2023-6152: Add email verification when updating user email (bsc#1219912)\n  * CVE-2024-6837: Fixed potential data source permission escalation (bsc#1236301)\n  * CVE-2024-8118: Fixed permission on external alerting rule write endpoint (bsc#1231024)\n\n- Potential breaking changes in version 10:\n  * In panels using the `extract fields` transformation, where one\n    of the extracted names collides with one of the already\n    existing ields, the extracted field will be renamed.\n  * For the existing backend mode users who have table\n    visualization might see some inconsistencies on their panels.\n    We have updated the table column naming. This will\n    potentially affect field transformations and/or field\n    overrides. To resolve this either: update transformation or\n    field override.\n  * For the existing backend mode users who have Transformations\n    with the `time` field, might see their transformations are\n    not working. Those panels that have broken transformations\n    will fail to render. This is because we changed the field\n    key. To resolve this either: Remove the affected panel and\n    re-create it; Select the `Time` field again; Edit the `time`\n    field as `Time` for transformation in `panel.json` or\n    `dashboard.json` \n  * The following data source permission endpoints have been removed:\n    `GET /datasources/:datasourceId/permissions`\n    `POST /api/datasources/:datasourceId/permissions`\n    `DELETE /datasources/:datasourceId/permissions`\n    `POST /datasources/:datasourceId/enable-permissions`\n    `POST /datasources/:datasourceId/disable-permissions`\n    + Please use the following endpoints instead:\n      `GET /api/access-control/datasources/:uid` for listing data\n       source permissions\n      `POST /api/access-control/datasources/:uid/users/:id`,\n      `POST /api/access-control/datasources/:uid/teams/:id` and\n      `POST /api/access-control/datasources/:uid/buildInRoles/:id` \n      for adding or removing data source permissions\n  * If you are using Terraform Grafana provider to manage data source permissions, you will need to upgrade your\n    provider.\n  * For the existing backend mode users who have table visualization might see some inconsistencies on their panels. \n    We have updated the table column naming. This will potentially affect field transformations and/or field overrides.\n  * The deprecated `/playlists/{uid}/dashboards` API endpoint has been removed. \n    Dashboard information can be retrieved from the `/dashboard/...` APIs.\n  * The `PUT /api/folders/:uid` endpoint no more supports modifying the folder's `UID`\n  * Removed all components for the old panel header design.\n  * Please review https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/breaking-changes/breaking-changes-v10-3/\n    for more details\n  * OAuth role mapping enforcement: This change impacts GitHub,\n    Gitlab, Okta, and Generic OAuth. To avoid overriding manually\n    set roles, enable the skip_org_role_sync option in the\n    Grafana configuration for your OAuth provider before\n    upgrading\n  * Angular has been deprecated\n  * Grafana legacy alerting has been deprecated\n  * API keys are migrating to service accounts\n  * The experimental \u0026#8220;dashboard previews\u0026#8221; feature is removed\n  * Usernames are now case-insensitive by default\n  * Grafana OAuth integrations do not work anymore with email lookups\n  * The \u0026#8220;Alias\u0026#8221; field in the CloudWatch data source is removed\n  * Athena data source plugin must be updated to version \u0026gt;=2.9.3\n  * Redshift data source plugin must be updated to version \u0026gt;=1.8.3\n  * DoiT International BigQuery plugin no longer supported\n  * Please review https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/breaking-changes/breaking-changes-v10-0\n    for more details\n\n- This update brings many new features, enhancements and fixes highlighted at:\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-4/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-3/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-2/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-1/\n  * https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v10-0/\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2024-45337",
      "Description": "Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.",
