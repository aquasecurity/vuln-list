See upstream changelog online at  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.2\u0026gt;.\n  Some notable changelogs from the last update:\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.0\u0026gt;\n  * \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.18.0\u0026gt;\n- Update to Go 1.22.\n\n- Add a new toggle file /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable which allows users to\n  disable the SUSEConnect integration with Docker (which creates special mounts\n  in /run/secrets to allow container-suseconnect to authenticate containers\n  with registries on registered hosts). bsc#1231348 bsc#1232999\n  In order to disable these mounts, just do\n    echo 0 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. In order to re-enable them, just do\n    echo 1 \u0026gt; /etc/docker/suse-secrets-enable\n  and restart Docker. Docker will output information on startup to tell you\n  whether the SUSE secrets feature is enabled or not.\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n\n- Disable docker-buildx builds for SLES. It turns out that build containers\n  with docker-buildx don't currently get the SUSE secrets mounts applied,\n  meaning that container-suseconnect doesn't work when building images.\n  bsc#1233819\n\n- Add docker-integration-tests-devel subpackage for building and running the\n  upstream Docker integration tests on machines to test that Docker works\n  properly. Users should not install this package.\n- docker-rpmlintrc updated to include allow-list for all of the integration\n  tests package, since it contains a bunch of stuff that wouldn't normally be\n  allowed.\n\n- Remove DOCKER_NETWORK_OPTS from docker.service. This was removed from\n  sysconfig a long time ago, and apparently this causes issues with systemd in\n  some cases.\n\n- Further merge docker and docker-stable specfiles to minimise the differences.\n  The main thing is that we now include both halves of the\n  Conflicts/Provides/Obsoletes dance in both specfiles.\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.17.1 to match standalone docker-buildx package we\n  are replacing. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.17.1\u0026gt;\n\n- Allow users to disable SUSE secrets support by setting\n  DOCKER_SUSE_SECRETS_ENABLE=0 in /etc/sysconfig/docker. bsc#1231348\n  bsc#1232999\n\n- Add %{_sysconfdir}/audit/rules.d to filelist.\n\n- Mark docker-buildx as required since classic \u0026quot;docker build\u0026quot; has been\n  deprecated since Docker 23.0. bsc#1230331\n- Import docker-buildx v0.16.2 as a subpackage. Previously this was a separate\n  package, but with docker-stable it will be necessary to maintain the packages\n  together and it makes more sense to have them live in the same OBS package.\n  bsc#1230333\n- Make some minor name macro updates to help with the docker-stable package\n  fork.\n\n- Update to Docker 26.1.5-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u0026lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.1/#2615\u0026gt;\n  bsc#1230294\n- This update includes fixes for:\n  * CVE-2024-41110. bsc#1228324\n  * CVE-2023-47108. bsc#1217070\n  * CVE-2023-45142. bsc#1228553\n- Rebase patches:\n  * 0001-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  * 0002-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  * 0003-BUILD-SLE12-revert-graphdriver-btrfs-use-kernel-UAPI.patch\n  * 0004-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n  * 0005-SLE12-revert-apparmor-remove-version-conditionals-fr.patch\n  * 0006-bsc1221916-update-to-patched-buildkit-version-to-fix.patch\n  * 0007-bsc1214855-volume-use-AtomicWriteFile-to-save-volume.patch\n  * cli-0001-docs-include-required-tools-in-source-tree.patch\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- Update to version 055+suse.396.g701c6212:  * fix(dasd-rules): handle all possible options in `rd.dasd` (bsc#1230110)\n\n- Update to version 055+suse.394.ga838b0c7:\n  * fix(zfcp_rules): check for presence of legacy rules (bsc#1230330)\n\nPackage e2fsprogs was updated:\n\n- resize2fs-Check-number-of-group-descriptors-only-if-.patch: resize2fs: Check  number of group descriptors only if meta_bg is disabled (bsc#1230145)\n\nPackage expat was updated:\n\n- security update- added patches\n  fix CVE-2024-50602 [bsc#1232579], DoS via XML_ResumeParser\n  + expat-CVE-2024-50602.patch\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2024-52533.patch: fix a single byte buffer overflow  (boo#1233282 CVE-2024-52533 glgo#GNOME/glib#3461).\n\nPackage glibc was updated:\n\n- tcache-thread-shutdown.patch: malloc: Initiate tcache shutdown even  without allocations (bsc#1228661, BZ #28028)\n\nPackage google-guest-agent was updated:\n\n- Update to version 20241011.01 (bsc#1231775, bsc#1231776)  * SUSE no overwrite bug fix, Ubuntu 18.04 exception (#451)\n- from version 20241011.00\n  * Skip MDS setup by default for this release (#450)\n- from version 20241010.01\n  * Revert \u0026quot;network/netplan: Adjust link-local accordingly (#443)\u0026quot; (#448)\n  * Set enable regardless of previous check failed or not (#447)\n- from version 20241009.03\n  * Avoid unnecessary reloads, check before overwriting configs (#446)\n- from version 20241009.02\n  * network/netplan: Do generate instead of apply (#445)\n- from version 20241009.01\n  * Skip SetupInterfaces if configs are already applied (#444)\n  * network/netplan: Adjust link-local accordingly (#443)\n  * Repeated logging could be mistaken for a recurring issue,\n    log mds mtls endpoint error only once (#439)\n  * Retry MDS PUT operation, reload netplan/networkctl\n    only if configs are changed (#438)\n  * Log interface state after setting up network (#437)\n  * network: Debian 12 rollback only if default netplan is ok (#436)\n- from version 20240930.01\n  * Change mtls mds defaults, update log message to assure error is harmless (#434)\n- from version 20240930.00\n  * network: Restore Debian 12 netplan configuration.

Enabling\n  kernel-default-livepatch-devel on TW makes it easier to test the\n  creation of kernel livepatches of the next SLE versions.\n- commit fd0b293\n\n- net: ks8851: Fix potential TX stall

The input URL is passed in a header, but sent back as\n  raw data in the frames body. If the plugin receiver does not\n  correctly unescape the URL we may get back a \u0026quot;https\\c//\u0026quot; which is\n  not usable.\n- Do not ignore return value of std::remove_if in MediaSyncFacade\n  (fixes #579)\n- Fix hang in curl code with no network connection (bsc#1230912)\n- version 17.35.12 (35)\n\n- Deprecate librpmDb::db_const_iterator default ctor (bsc#1230267)\n  It's preferred to explicitly tell the root directory of the\n  system whose database you want to query.\n- version 17.35.11 (35)\n\n- API refactoring.

In such scenarios, every\nincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.\n\nAfter some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked\ndown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (\"ipv6: do not free rt if\nFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule\").\n\nThe problem with that change is that the generic `args-\u003eflags` always have\n`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag\n`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not\ndecreasing the refcount when needed.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:\n     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop\n   This can be done with:\n     sudo nft create table inet test\n     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'\n     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop\n - Run:\n     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0\n - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase\n   with every incoming ipv6 packet.\n\nThis patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol\nspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`\nargument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic\nFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71\n[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99",

Unregistering the slave\ninterfaces is unnecessary and unhelpful. Instead, after the slaves have\nstopped being uppers of the DSA master, we can now reset to NULL the\nmaster-\u003edsa_ptr pointer, which will make DSA start ignoring all future\nnotifier events on the master.",

This will cause a\nnew entry in idev-\u003emc_tomb to be allocated for each multicast group\nthe interface is subscribed to, which in turn leaks one struct ifmcaddr6\nper nontrivial multicast group the interface is subscribed to.\n\nThe following reproducer will leak at least $n objects:\n\nip addr add ff2e::4242/32 dev eth0 autojoin\nsysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6=1\nfor i in $(seq 1 $n); do\n\tip link set up eth0; ip link set down eth0\ndone\n\nJoining groups with IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (unprivileged) or setting the\nsysctl net.ipv6.conf.eth0.forwarding to 1 (=\u003e subscribing to ff02::2)\ncan also be used to create a nontrivial idev-\u003emc_list, which will the\nleak objects with the right up-down-sequence.\n\nBased on both sources for NETDEV_DOWN events the interface IPv6 state\nshould be considered:\n\n - not ready if the network interface is not ready OR IPv6 is disabled\n   for it\n - ready if the network interface is ready AND IPv6 is enabled for it\n\nThe functions ipv6_mc_up() and ipv6_down() should only be run when this\nstate changes.\n\nImplement this by remembering when the IPv6 state is ready, and only\nrun ipv6_mc_down() if it actually changed from ready to not ready.\n\nThe other direction (not ready -\u003e ready) already works correctly, as:\n\n - the interface notification triggered codepath for NETDEV_UP /\n   NETDEV_CHANGE returns early if ipv6 is disabled, and\n - the disable_ipv6=0 triggered codepath skips fully initializing the\n   interface as long as addrconf_link_ready(dev) returns false\n - calling ipv6_mc_up() repeatedly does not leak anything",

Since d7dac083414eb5bb99a6d2ed53dc2c1b405224e5\n(\"net-sysfs: update the queue counts in the unregistration path\"),\nunregister_netdev() indirectly sets real_num_tx_queues to 0.

This change was made\nby commit ce8ea7cc6eb313 (\"btrfs: don't call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots\nin flushoncommit\"). After that change we started producing that warning,\nand every now and then a user reports this since the warning happens too\noften, it spams dmesg/syslog, and a user is unsure if this reflects any\nproblem that might compromise the filesystem's reliability.\n\nWe can not just lock the sb-\u003es_umount semaphore before calling\nwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that would at least deadlock with\nfilesystem freezing, since at fs/super.c:freeze_super() sync_filesystem()\nis called while we are holding that semaphore in write mode, and that can\ntrigger a transaction commit, resulting in a deadlock. It would also\ntrigger the same type of deadlock in the unmount path. Possibly, it could\nalso introduce some other locking dependencies that lockdep would report.\n\nTo fix this call try_to_writeback_inodes_sb() instead of\nwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that will try to read lock sb-\u003es_umount\nand then will only call writeback_inodes_sb() if it was able to lock it.\nThis is fine because the cases where it can't read lock sb-\u003es_umount\nare during a filesystem unmount or during a filesystem freeze - in those\ncases sb-\u003es_umount is write locked and sync_filesystem() is called, which\ncalls writeback_inodes_sb(). In other words, in all cases where we can't\ntake a read lock on sb-\u003es_umount, writeback is already being triggered\nelsewhere.\n\nAn alternative would be to call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with a\nnumber of pages different from LONG_MAX, for example matching the number\nof delalloc bytes we currently have, in \n---truncated---",

This has been bisected to\ncommit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (\"kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid\nsched_task_group\")\n\nThere  is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)\nwithin a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref  in\nreweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawns\nnumber of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),\nwait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets\ninvoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()\nfor it.\n\nIn the above scenario there is a possibility that\nsetpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread\nin the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for\nwhich the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This will\ntrigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(),  as it will\ntry to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.\n\nBefore the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has been\nset in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),\nbefore the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done in\nthe sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issue\nthe remove the update_load param from the update_load param() function\nand call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have the\nTASK_NEW flag set.",

This results in the VF potentially removing\nits DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.\n\nAdditionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within\nthe ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior\nto the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task\nconcurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in\nsimilar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.\n\nFix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and\nremoval flows using the existing VF cfg_lock. This ensures that we\ncannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a\nvirtchnl message or a reset are occurring.\n\nThis locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit\nc503e63200c6 (\"ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown\"), so we\ncan simply revert it.\n\nNote that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the\noriginal commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race\nconditions.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: sja1105: avoid out of bounds access in sja1105_init_l2_policing()\n\nThe SJA1105 family has 45 L2 policing table entries\n(SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT) and SJA1110 has 110\n(SJA1110_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). Keeping the table structure but\naccounting for the difference in port count (5 in SJA1105 vs 10 in\nSJA1110) does not fully explain the difference. Rather, the SJA1110 also\nhas L2 ingress policers for multicast traffic. If a packet is classified\nas multicast, it will be processed by the policer index 99 + SRCPORT.\n\nThe sja1105_init_l2_policing() function initializes all L2 policers such\nthat they don't interfere with normal packet reception by default. To have\na common code between SJA1105 and SJA1110, the index of the multicast\npolicer for the port is calculated because it's an index that is out of\nbounds for SJA1105 but in bounds for SJA1110, and a bounds check is\nperformed.\n\nThe code fails to do the proper thing when determining what to do with the\nmulticast policer of port 0 on SJA1105 (ds-\u003enum_ports = 5). The \"mcast\"\nindex will be equal to 45, which is also equal to\ntable-\u003eops-\u003emax_entry_count (SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). So it passes\nthrough the check. But at the same time, SJA1105 doesn't have multicast\npolicers. So the code programs the SHARINDX field of an out-of-bounds\nelement in the L2 Policing table of the static config.\n\nThe comparison between index 45 and 45 entries should have determined the\ncode to not access this policer index on SJA1105, since its memory wasn't\neven allocated.\n\nWith enough bad luck, the out-of-bounds write could even overwrite other\nvalid kernel data, but in this case, the issue was detected using KASAN.\n\nKernel log:\n\nsja1105 spi5.0: Probed switch chip: SJA1105Q\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sja1105_setup+0x1cbc/0x2340\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffffff880bd57708 by task kworker/u8:0/8\n...\nWorkqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func\nCall trace:\n...\nsja1105_setup+0x1cbc/0x2340\ndsa_register_switch+0x1284/0x18d0\nsja1105_probe+0x748/0x840\n...\nAllocated by task 8:\n...\nsja1105_setup+0x1bcc/0x2340\ndsa_register_switch+0x1284/0x18d0\nsja1105_probe+0x748/0x840\n...",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removed\n\nAfter 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the \"type\" field\nof the event then uses the first type number that is available (not\ncurrently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of the\nbinary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them to\nlogic that can parse the binary blob.\n\nThe issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced and\nis in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it is\ndynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamic\nevent is created that has the same number that new event's logic on\nparsing the binary blob will be used.\n\nTo show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel:\n\n # cd /sys/kernel/tracing\n # for i in `seq 65536`; do\n     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' \u003e kprobe_events\n # done\n\nFor every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events will\nremove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) and\nincrease the type number to the next available on until the type number\nreaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After it\nreaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks for\nthe next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that number\nis then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,\nonce the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event in\nthat loop will remain the same.\n\nNow that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reuse\nthe previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.\nAfter the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads the\ndo_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer.\n\n # echo 1 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n # cat /etc/passwd \u003e /dev/null\n # cat trace\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849620: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849838: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849880: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196\n # echo 0 \u003e kprobes/foo/enable\n\nNow if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string:\n\n # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' \u003e kprobe_events\n\nAnd now we can the trace:\n\n # cat trace\n        sendmail-1942    [002] .....   530.136320: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930817: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.930961: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934278: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������\"\n             cat-2046    [004] .....   530.934563: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x240) arg1=\"���������������������������������������\n---truncated---",

      "Description": "OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go. A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.",

Version 0.46.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can be used. The other possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing `otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider` option with `noop.NewMeterProvider`.",

Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent\n\nThis patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan\nand Christian Rossow.\n\nACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:\n\n   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if\n   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c=\n   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\n   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\n   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\n   duplicate (SEG.ACK \u003c SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK\n   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK \u003e SND.NXT) then send an\n   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that\n   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means\n   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the\n   ACK check more stringent since any ACK \u003c SND.UNA wouldn't be\n   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -\n   MAX.SND.WND) \u003c= SEG.ACK \u003c= SND.NXT) get through.\n\nThis can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,\nby not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.\n\nThis greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.\n\nI added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,\neven if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.\n\ntp-\u003ebytes_acked was added in linux-4.2\n\nFollowing packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows\nthe issue at hand:\n\n0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3\n+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0\n+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0\n+0 listen(3, 1024) = 0\n\n// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //\n\n// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to\n// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.

The stack trace is something like the one\n   reported in Link tag below:\n\n   general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000041: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\n   KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000208-0x000000000000020f]\n   CPU: 1 PID: 34 Comm: kworker/u4:2 Not tainted 6.1.0-syzkaller-13872-gb6bb9676f216 #0\n   Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 10/26/2022\n   Workqueue: btrfs-qgroup-rescan btrfs_work_helper\n   RIP: 0010:start_transaction+0x48/0x10f0 fs/btrfs/transaction.c:564\n   Code: 48 89 fb 48 (...)\n   RSP: 0018:ffffc90000ab7ab0 EFLAGS: 00010206\n   RAX: 0000000000000041 RBX: 0000000000000208 RCX: ffff88801779ba80\n   RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: 0000000000000000\n   RBP: dffffc0000000000 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: fffff52000156f5d\n   R10: fffff52000156f5d R11: 1ffff92000156f5c R12: 0000000000000000\n   R13: 0000000000000001 R14: 0000000000000001 R15: 0000000000000003\n   FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b9900000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n   CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n   CR2: 00007f2bea75b718 CR3: 000000001d0cc000 CR4: 00000000003506e0\n   DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n   DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n   Call Trace:\n    \u003cTASK\u003e\n    btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker+0x3bb/0x6a0 fs/btrfs/qgroup.c:3402\n    btrfs_work_helper+0x312/0x850 fs/btrfs/async-thread.c:280\n    process_one_work+0x877/0xdb0 kernel/workqueue.c:2289\n    worker_thread+0xb14/0x1330 kernel/workqueue.c:2436\n    kthread+0x266/0x300 kernel/kthread.c:376\n    ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:308\n    \u003c/TASK\u003e\n   Modules linked in:\n\nSo fix this by having the rescan worker function not attempt to start a\ntransaction if it didn't do any rescan work.",

This is an invalid\ncombination according to the comment above 'struct nla_policy':\n\n\"\nMeaning of `validate' field, use via NLA_POLICY_VALIDATE_FN:\n   NLA_BINARY           Validation function called for the attribute.\n   All other            Unused - but note that it's a union\n\"\n\nThis can trigger the warning [1] in nla_get_range_unsigned() when\nvalidation of the attribute fails. Despite being of 'NLA_U32' type, the\nassociated 'min'/'max' fields in the policy are negative as they are\naliased by the 'validate' field.\n\nFix by changing the attribute type to 'NLA_BINARY' which is consistent\nwith the above comment and all other users of NLA_POLICY_VALIDATE_FN().\nAs a result, move the length validation to the validation function.\n\nNo regressions in MPLS tests:\n\n # ./tdc.py -f tc-tests/actions/mpls.json\n [...]\n # echo $?\n 0\n\n[1]\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 17743 at lib/nlattr.c:118\nnla_get_range_unsigned+0x1d8/0x1e0 lib/nlattr.c:117\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 17743 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted 6.1.0-rc8 #3\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS\nrel-1.13.0-48-gd9c812dda519-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:nla_get_range_unsigned+0x1d8/0x1e0 lib/nlattr.c:117\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n __netlink_policy_dump_write_attr+0x23d/0x990 net/netlink/policy.c:310\n netlink_policy_dump_write_attr+0x22/0x30 net/netlink/policy.c:411\n netlink_ack_tlv_fill net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2454 [inline]\n netlink_ack+0x546/0x760 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2506\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x1b7/0x240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2546\n rtnetlink_rcv+0x18/0x20 net/core/rtnetlink.c:6109\n netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1319 [inline]\n netlink_unicast+0x5e9/0x6b0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1345\n netlink_sendmsg+0x739/0x860 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1921\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:714 [inline]\n sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:734 [inline]\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x38f/0x500 net/socket.c:2482\n ___sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2536 [inline]\n __sys_sendmsg+0x197/0x230 net/socket.c:2565\n __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2574 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2572 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x42/0x50 net/socket.c:2572\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x2b/0x70 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd",

There are a couple of problems with the way this currently\nworks:\n\nIt's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit\ncleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroed\nout. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see a\nvalid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.\n\nAlso, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_file\nif one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with a\nvalid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with\nthe value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.\n\nFix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant that\ntakes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called,\nwe'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If\nthe nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore the\noptional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.\n\nAlso rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an \"opened\" variant and\ndon't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we already\nhave a cached open file.",

The value of iovad-\u003eanchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then when\niovad-\u003ecached_node is iovad-\u003eanchor, curr_iova-\u003epfn_hi + 1 will\noverflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn is\nupdated to 0, and then new_pfn \u003c low_pfn returns false to make the\nallocation successful.\n\nThis issue occurs in the following two situations:\n1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializing\niova domain, iovad-\u003ecached_node is assigned as iovad-\u003eanchor. For\nexample, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,\nand the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The\nfollowing is the log information, new-\u003epfn_lo is smaller than\niovad-\u003ecached_node.\n\nExample log as follows:\n[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova\u0026]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nstart_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00\n[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova\u0026]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nsuccess start_pfn:0x1f0000,new-\u003epfn_lo:0x1efe00,new-\u003epfn_hi:0x1f08ff\n\n2. The node with the largest iova-\u003epfn_lo value in the iova domain\nis deleted, iovad-\u003ecached_node will be updated to iovad-\u003eanchor,\nand then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can\nbe allocated in the domain.\n\nAfter judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1\nto fix the overflow issue.",

      "Description": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload\n\nWhen a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the\nunderlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the\nassociated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put().

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcache\n\nWhen skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threads\nswapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B). \nBefore one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to the\nPTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free the\nentry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. \nIt breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,\ncausing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into the\nPTE and cause data corruption.\n\nOne possible callstack is like this:\n\nCPU0                                 CPU1\n----                                 ----\ndo_swap_page()                       do_swap_page() with same entry\n\u003cdirect swapin path\u003e                 \u003cdirect swapin path\u003e\n\u003calloc page A\u003e                       \u003calloc page B\u003e\nswap_read_folio() \u003c- read to page A  swap_read_folio() \u003c- read to page B\n\u003cslow on later locks or interrupt\u003e   \u003cfinished swapin first\u003e\n...                                  set_pte_at()\n                                     swap_free() \u003c- entry is free\n                                     \u003cwrite to page B, now page A stalled\u003e\n                                     \u003cswap out page B to same swap entry\u003e\npte_same() \u003c- Check pass, PTE seems\n              unchanged, but page A\n              is stalled!\nswap_free() \u003c- page B content lost!\nset_pte_at() \u003c- staled page A installed!\n\nAnd besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard the\nentry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()\non CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause data\nloss.\n\nTo fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry using\nthe cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent any\nparallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin after\nPT unlocked.\n\nRacers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  A\nschedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated page\nfaults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise to\nperf statistics.

The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the\natomic context of the eventfd wake function.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offload\n\nBefore this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replay\nwould race against the creation of new group memberships, either from\nthe IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.\n\nWhile new memberships are immediately visible to walkers of\nbr-\u003emdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev event\nsubscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replay\nlist was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,\nit would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.\n\nThe driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internally\nconsidered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, only\na single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As a\nconsequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (at\nleast DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardware\ndatabase when the bridge was destroyed.\n\nThis is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion events\nmay still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already have\nbeen removed from br-\u003emdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated in\nthat scenario.\n\nTo a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge in\nwhich a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (in\nhardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge's\nknowledge.\n\nFor example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge and\nimmediately add a port to it:\n\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridge mcast_snooping 1 \u0026\u0026 \\\n    \u003e ip link set dev x3 up master br0\n\nAnd then destroy the bridge:\n\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu\n    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a\n    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X\n    33:33:00:00:00:6a     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$\n\nThe two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because the\nport (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via the\noriginal event and once via a replay. Since only a single delete\nnotification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge is\ndestroyed.\n\nThen add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardware\ndomain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:\n\n    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridge mcast_snooping 0 \u0026\u0026 \\\n    \u003e ip link set dev x3 up master br1\n\nAll multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now be\nflooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the old\nmemberships are still active in the hardware database, causing the\nswitch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port\n0).\n\nEliminate the race in two steps:\n\n1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay\n   list.\n\nThis prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generating\nthe replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred event\nwas already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed the\nlock. Therefore:\n\n2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already\n   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the\n   replay list, when replaying additions.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngenirq/cpuhotplug, x86/vector: Prevent vector leak during CPU offline\n\nThe absence of IRQD_MOVE_PCNTXT prevents immediate effectiveness of\ninterrupt affinity reconfiguration via procfs. Instead, the change is\ndeferred until the next instance of the interrupt being triggered on the\noriginal CPU.\n\nWhen the interrupt next triggers on the original CPU, the new affinity is\nenforced within __irq_move_irq(). A vector is allocated from the new CPU,\nbut the old vector on the original CPU remains and is not immediately\nreclaimed. Instead, apicd-\u003emove_in_progress is flagged, and the reclaiming\nprocess is delayed until the next trigger of the interrupt on the new CPU.\n\nUpon the subsequent triggering of the interrupt on the new CPU,\nirq_complete_move() adds a task to the old CPU's vector_cleanup list if it\nremains online. Subsequently, the timer on the old CPU iterates over its\nvector_cleanup list, reclaiming old vectors.\n\nHowever, a rare scenario arises if the old CPU is outgoing before the\ninterrupt triggers again on the new CPU.\n\nIn that case irq_force_complete_move() is not invoked on the outgoing CPU\nto reclaim the old apicd-\u003eprev_vector because the interrupt isn't currently\naffine to the outgoing CPU, and irq_needs_fixup() returns false. Even\nthough __vector_schedule_cleanup() is later called on the new CPU, it\ndoesn't reclaim apicd-\u003eprev_vector; instead, it simply resets both\napicd-\u003emove_in_progress and apicd-\u003eprev_vector to 0.\n\nAs a result, the vector remains unreclaimed in vector_matrix, leading to a\nCPU vector leak.\n\nTo address this issue, move the invocation of irq_force_complete_move()\nbefore the irq_needs_fixup() call to reclaim apicd-\u003eprev_vector, if the\ninterrupt is currently or used to be affine to the outgoing CPU.\n\nAdditionally, reclaim the vector in __vector_schedule_cleanup() as well,\nfollowing a warning message, although theoretically it should never see\napicd-\u003emove_in_progress with apicd-\u003eprev_cpu pointing to an offline CPU.",

This netif_rx()\nimplementation is guarded by local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable().\nThe local_bh_enable() may call do_softirq() to run softirqs in case\nany are pending. One of the softirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately\nreaches the driver .start_xmit callback. If that happens, the system\nhangs.

Place local_bh_enable() outside of\nthe spinlock protected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq()\nwithout the ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and\nsafely call ks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the\nalready locked spinlock.\n\nSince ks8851_irq() is protected by local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable()\nnow, replace netif_rx() with __netif_rx() which is not duplicating the\nlocal_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() calls.",

Unfortunately, the operand passed\nto the TLBI RANGE instruction isn't correctly sorted out due to the\ncommit 117940aa6e5f (\"KVM: arm64: Define kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range()\").\nIt leads to crash on the destination VM after live migration because\nTLBs aren't flushed completely and some of the dirty pages are missed.\n\nFor example, I have a VM where 8GB memory is assigned, starting from\n0x40000000 (1GB). Note that the host has 4KB as the base page size.\nIn the middile of migration, kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() is executed\nto flush TLBs. It passes MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES as the argument to\n__kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() and __flush_s2_tlb_range_op(). SCALE#3\nand NUM#31, corresponding to MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES, isn't supported\nby __TLBI_RANGE_NUM(). In this specific case, -1 has been returned\nfrom __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() for SCALE#3/2/1/0 and rejected by the loop\nin the __flush_tlb_range_op() until the variable @scale underflows\nand becomes -9, 0xffff708000040000 is set as the operand. The operand\nis wrong since it's sorted out by __TLBI_VADDR_RANGE() according to\ninvalid @scale and @num.\n\nFix it by extending __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() to support the combination of\nSCALE#3 and NUM#31. With the changes, [-1 31] instead of [-1 30] can\nbe returned from the macro, meaning the TLBs for 0x200000 pages in the\nabove example can be flushed in one shoot with SCALE#3 and NUM#31. The\nmacro TLBI_RANGE_MASK is dropped since no one uses it any more. The\ncomments are also adjusted accordingly.",

As the inner\nprotocol can be Ethernet, NSH GSO handler, nsh_gso_segment(), calls\nskb_mac_gso_segment() to invoke inner protocol GSO handlers.\n\nnsh_gso_segment() does the following for the original skb before\ncalling skb_mac_gso_segment()\n\n  1. reset skb-\u003enetwork_header\n  2. save the original skb-\u003e{mac_heaeder,mac_len} in a local variable\n  3. pull the NSH header\n  4. resets skb-\u003emac_header\n  5. set up skb-\u003emac_len and skb-\u003eprotocol for the inner protocol.\n\nand does the following for the segmented skb\n\n  6. set ntohs(ETH_P_NSH) to skb-\u003eprotocol\n  7. push the NSH header\n  8. restore skb-\u003emac_header\n  9. set skb-\u003emac_header + mac_len to skb-\u003enetwork_header\n 10. restore skb-\u003emac_len\n\nThere are two problems in 6-7 and 8-9.\n\n  (a)\n  After 6 \u0026 7, skb-\u003edata points to the NSH header, so the outer header\n  (ETH_P_8021AD in this case) is stripped when skb is sent out of netdev.\n\n  Also, if NSH is encapsulated by NSH + Ethernet (so NSH-Ethernet-NSH),\n  skb_pull() in the first nsh_gso_segment() will make skb-\u003edata point\n  to the middle of the outer NSH or Ethernet header because the Ethernet\n  header is not pulled by the second nsh_gso_segment().\n\n  (b)\n  While restoring skb-\u003e{mac_header,network_header} in 8 \u0026 9,\n  nsh_gso_segment() does not assume that the data in the linear\n  buffer is shifted.\n\n  However, udp6_ufo_fragment() could shift the data and change\n  skb-\u003emac_header accordingly as demonstrated by syzbot.\n\n  If this happens, even the restored skb-\u003emac_header points to\n  the middle of the outer header.\n\nIt seems nsh_gso_segment() has never worked with outer headers so far.\n\nAt the end of nsh_gso_segment(), the outer header must be restored for\nthe segmented skb, instead of the NSH header.\n\nTo do that, let's calculate the outer header position relatively from\nthe inner header and set skb-\u003e{data,mac_header,protocol} properly.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_process_outbound drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:524 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l3 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:602 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ipvlan_queue_xmit+0xf44/0x16b0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:668\n ipvlan_process_outbound drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:524 [inline]\n ipvlan_xmit_mode_l3 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:602 [inline]\n ipvlan_queue_xmit+0xf44/0x16b0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_core.c:668\n ipvlan_start_xmit+0x5c/0x1a0 drivers/net/ipvlan/ipvlan_main.c:222\n __netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:4989 [inline]\n netdev_start_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:5003 [inline]\n xmit_one net/core/dev.c:3547 [inline]\n dev_hard_start_xmit+0x244/0xa10 net/core/dev.c:3563\n __dev_queue_xmit+0x33ed/0x51c0 net/core/dev.c:4351\n dev_queue_xmit include/linux/netdevice.h:3171 [inline]\n packet_xmit+0x9c/0x6b0 net/packet/af_packet.c:276\n packet_snd net/packet/af_packet.c:3081 [inline]\n packet_sendmsg+0x8aef/0x9f10 net/packet/af_packet.c:3113\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline]\n __sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:745 [inline]\n __sys_sendto+0x735/0xa10 net/socket.c:2191\n __do_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2203 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendto net/socket.c:2199 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendto+0x125/0x1c0 net/socket.c:2199\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xcf/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nUninit was created at:\n slab_post_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:3819 [inline]\n slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3860 [inline]\n __do_kmalloc_node mm/slub.c:3980 [inline]\n __kmalloc_node_track_caller+0x705/0x1000 mm/slub.c:4001\n kmalloc_reserve+0x249/0x4a0 net/core/skbuff.c:582\n __\n---truncated---",

However, the\nexecution path for accepting an incoming connection never calls\nnetdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimately\nto kernel crashes.\n\nA typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of the\nfollowing errors:\n\n    refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.\n    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\n\nAnd will then have a trace like:\n\n    Call Trace:\n    \u003cTASK\u003e\n    ? show_regs+0x64/0x70\n    ? __warn+0x83/0x120\n    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100\n    ? report_bug+0x158/0x190\n    ? prb_read_valid+0x20/0x30\n    ? handle_bug+0x3e/0x70\n    ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70\n    ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100\n    ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100\n    ax25_release+0x2ad/0x360\n    __sock_release+0x35/0xa0\n    sock_close+0x19/0x20\n    [...]\n\nOn reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets\nstuck in an infinite loop:\n\n    unregister_netdevice: waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0\n\nThis patch corrects these issues by ensuring that we call netdev_hold()\nand ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This makes the\nlogic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind(): in both\ncases we increment the refcount, which is ultimately decremented in\nax25_release().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free\n\nCurrently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying\nto cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as\nwell, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since\nthis relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock\nsituation as the previous patch.\n\nIt would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,\nas the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once\nasync_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized\nbefore it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to\narm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is\nsufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return\nHRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.\n\nHowever, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer\nbefore entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to\ntimer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback\nrunning concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is\nsignificantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration\nhappening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it\nthe struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.\n\nHence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after\nasync_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock\nissues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the\nglobal workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at\n_different_ points of time, so can share space).\n\nUpdate existing code comments to reflect the new state of affairs.",

That commit introduced\nvma-\u003efence-\u003eactive in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait\nselectively on that one instead of vma-\u003eactive since only idleness of\nfence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a\n(\"drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal\") replaced the call to\nfence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and\nalso added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(\u0026fence-\u003eactive)) in front.\nNo justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of\nvma-\u003efence-\u003eactive without first waiting on it.\n\nThe issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence\nregisters on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked\non completion of a request that was using them on the other, still\nprocessed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by\nwaiting for idleness of vma-\u003efence-\u003eactive in i915_vma_revoke_fence().\n\n(cherry picked from commit 24bb052d3dd499c5956abad5f7d8e4fd07da7fb1)",

In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.",

It was found that all variables in the jffs_inode_info\nstructure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspected that these\nvariables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a during memory testing,\nwhich is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable is initialized in the\nfunction jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized in\nthe function jffs2_init_inode_info.\n\nThe function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,\nbut in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,\nwhich releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inode\nis not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_locked\nmay enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.\n\nSince the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,\nthe fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds\n\nFix UBSAN warnings that occur when using a system with 32 physical\ncpu cores or more, or when the user defines a number of Ethernet\nqueues greater than or equal to FP_SB_MAX_E1x using the num_queues\nmodule parameter.\n\nCurrently there is a read/write out of bounds that occurs on the array\n\"struct stats_query_entry query\" present inside the \"bnx2x_fw_stats_req\"\nstruct in \"drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h\".\nLooking at the definition of the \"struct stats_query_entry query\" array:\n\nstruct stats_query_entry query[FP_SB_MAX_E1x+\n         BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX];\n\nFP_SB_MAX_E1x is defined as the maximum number of fast path interrupts and\nhas a value of 16, while BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX has a value of 3\nmeaning the array has a total size of 19.\nSince accesses to \"struct stats_query_entry query\" are offset-ted by\nBNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX, that means that the total number of Ethernet\nqueues should not exceed FP_SB_MAX_E1x (16). However one of these queues\nis reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set\nto [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if\nit is not.\n\nThis is also described in a comment in the source code in\ndrivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition\nof FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important\nfor this patch\n\n/*\n  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is\n  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the\n  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default\n  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can\n  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such\n  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like\n  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues\n  *\n  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:\n  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of\n  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1\n  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)\n  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues\n  *    is Y+1\n  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for\n  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional\n  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).\n  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE\n  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.\n  */\n\nHowever this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can\nhandle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.\nLooking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally\nusing the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (\"bnx2x: Add 57712 support\").\nBack then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver\nwas later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be\nlimited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the\narray \"stats_query_entry query\" was still limited to using the FP-SB\navailable to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was\nupdated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being\naware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN\nwarnings seen in the stack traces below.\n\nThis patch increases the size of the \"stats_query_entry query\" array by\nreplacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle\nboth types of NICs.\n\nStack traces:\n\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in\n       drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x_stats.c:1529:11\nindex 20 is out of range for type 'stats_query_entry [19]'\nCPU: 12 PID: 858 Comm: systemd-network Not tainted 6.9.0-060900rc7-generic\n\t     #202405052133\nHardware name: HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9/ProLiant DL360 \n---truncated---",

To do so, it polls the\nconfig space of the first child device on the secondary bus.  If that\nchild device is concurrently removed, accesses to its struct pci_dev\ncause the kernel to oops.\n\nThat's because pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() neglects to hold a\nreference on the child device.  Before v6.3, the function was only\ncalled on resume from system sleep or on runtime resume.  Holding a\nreference wasn't necessary back then because the pciehp IRQ thread\ncould never run concurrently.  (On resume from system sleep, IRQs are\nnot enabled until after the resume_noirq phase.  And runtime resume is\nalways awaited before a PCI device is removed.)\n\nHowever starting with v6.3, pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() is also\ncalled on a DPC event.  Commit 53b54ad074de (\"PCI/DPC: Await readiness\nof secondary bus after reset\"), which introduced that, failed to\nappreciate that pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() now needs to hold a\nreference on the child device because dpc_handler() and pciehp may\nindeed run concurrently.

CMDQ driver uses devm_mbox_controller_register() in cmdq_probe()\n   to bind the cmdq device to the mbox_controller, so\n   devm_mbox_controller_unregister() will automatically unregister\n   the device bound to the mailbox controller when the device-managed\n   resource is removed. That means devm_mbox_controller_unregister()\n   and cmdq_mbox_shoutdown() will be called after cmdq_remove().\n2. CMDQ driver also uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() in cmdq_probe() after\n   devm_mbox_controller_register(), so that devm_pm_runtime_disable()\n   will be called after cmdq_remove(), but before\n   devm_mbox_controller_unregister().\n\nTo fix this problem, cmdq_probe() needs to move\ndevm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() to make\ndevm_pm_runtime_disable() be called after\ndevm_mbox_controller_unregister().",

      "Description": "The UNIX editor Vim prior to version 9.1.0678 has a use-after-free error in argument list handling. When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*` autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that was just opened is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causes the window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument list that we are actually modifying. Once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free. Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin), but it will crash Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678.",

But this will lead to `libbpf_probe_bpf_prog_type`\nAPI broken which use verifier log to probe prog type and will log\nnothing if we reject invalid EXT prog before bpf_check().\n\nAnother way is by adding null check in resolve_prog_type().\n\nThe issue was introduced by commit 4a9c7bbe2ed4 (\"bpf: Resolve to\nprog-\u003eaux-\u003edst_prog-\u003etype only for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT\") which wanted\nto correct type resolution for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING programs. Before\nthat, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually follows\nthe logic below:\n\n  prog-\u003eaux-\u003edst_prog ? prog-\u003eaux-\u003edst_prog-\u003etype : prog-\u003etype;\n\nIt implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,\nthe prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.\nSo just keep using it.\n\nFix this by returning `prog-\u003etype` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`\nis not present in resolve_prog_type().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warning\n\nACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM\n(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former can\ncontain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in each\nregion (i.e., tc chain) is limited.\n\nIn order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the device\nallows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in up\nto 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented using\ndst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on the\nnumber of masks being used (and therefore does not support mask\naggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.\n\nThe driver uses the \"objagg\" library to perform the mask aggregation by\npassing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether the\nfilter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters in\ndifferent TCAMs cannot share a mask.\n\nThe set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of the\nfilters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver will\nperiodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set (\"hints\") by\nlooking at all the existing objects.\n\nWhen the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregated\nthe driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /\nC-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is to\nmove as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbids\ntwo identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen if\none was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in the\nA-TCAM.\n\nThe above can result in the following set of hints:\n\nH1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -\u003e H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + delta\nH3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -\u003e H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + delta\n\nAfter getting the hints from the library the driver will start migrating\nfilters from one region to another while consulting the computed hints\nand instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions during\nthe transition.\n\nAssuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in the\nnew region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent of\nH1, the library will try to find the object associated with it and\ncreate it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)\nwill be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will either\nreturn H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparison\nfunction that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.\n\nThis can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported by\nthe library [1].\n\nFix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver and\nthe library as the driver was the only user.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage\n\nWhen opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is\ndone against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file\npointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file\nmetadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how\nto set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the\npermissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.\n\nFor example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not\nset-id:\n\n---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nto set-id and non-executable:\n\n---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nit is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been\ndisallowed.\n\nWhile this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been\nobserved (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating\nthe setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being\nworld-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid\nbit. For example, \"chmod o-x,u+s target\" makes \"target\" executable only\nby uid \"root\" and gid \"cdrom\", while also becoming setuid-root:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nbecomes:\n\n-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\n\nBut racing the chmod means users without group \"cdrom\" membership can\nget the permission to execute \"target\" just before the chmod, and when\nthe chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the\nsetuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of \"only cdrom\ngroup members can setuid to root\".\n\nRe-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata\nhas changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,\nbut until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a\nfull inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that\nthis is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.",

It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg ID\nspace.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms for\nmodifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()\nhappen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutex\nfrom concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idr\nwas not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently for\ndifferent memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.\n\nWe have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency in\nour fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part of\nlist_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparenting\ncode.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentry\nand inode), the super_block's list_lru didn't have list_lru_one for the\nmemcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object is\nnot allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehow\nmemcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg but\nreturned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.\n\nLooking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg's id\nis not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgs\nhave same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the most\nreasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to race\nbetween multiple idr_remove() calls or race between\nidr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causing\nmultiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of them\nwould cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access from\nother memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one.",

Then, this new struct is freed and\nthe pointers start leading to nowhere.\n\nBut generally speaking, the current logic is very fragile. It claims\nto be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact, it\nconsumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this\nfunction, there are two vports allocated with their queues and vectors.\nMoreover, it claims to prevent the driver from running into \"bad state\",\nbut in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport in the\npartially allocated state.\nFinally, if the interface is down when the function is called, it always\nallocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the\ninterface later on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there's\na clear memory leak here.\n\nJust don't allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves\ncrashes and memory leaks.

What it does is copying enough words\n(BITS_TO_LONGS(count/BITS_PER_LONG)), then memsets the rest.\nThat works fine, *if* all bits past the cutoff point are\nclear.  Otherwise we are risking garbage from the last word\nwe'd copied.\n\nFor most of the callers that is true - expand_fdtable() has\ncount equal to old-\u003emax_fds, so there's no open descriptors\npast count, let alone fully occupied words in -\u003eopen_fds[],\nwhich is what bits in -\u003efull_fds_bits[] correspond to.\n\nThe other caller (dup_fd()) passes sane_fdtable_size(old_fdt, max_fds),\nwhich is the smallest multiple of BITS_PER_LONG that covers all\nopened descriptors below max_fds.  In the common case (copying on\nfork()) max_fds is ~0U, so all opened descriptors will be below\nit and we are fine, by the same reasons why the call in expand_fdtable()\nis safe.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a case where max_fds is less than that\nand where we might, indeed, end up with junk in -\u003efull_fds_bits[] -\nclose_range(from, to, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) with\n\t* descriptor table being currently shared\n\t* 'to' being above the current capacity of descriptor table\n\t* 'from' being just under some chunk of opened descriptors.\nIn that case we end up with observably wrong behaviour - e.g. spawn\na child with CLONE_FILES, get all descriptors in range 0..127 open,\nthen close_range(64, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) and watch dup(0) ending\nup with descriptor #128, despite #64 being observably not open.\n\nThe minimally invasive fix would be to deal with that in dup_fd().\nIf this proves to add measurable overhead, we can go that way, but\nlet's try to fix copy_fd_bitmaps() first.\n\n* new helper: bitmap_copy_and_expand(to, from, bits_to_copy, size).\n* make copy_fd_bitmaps() take the bitmap size in words, rather than\nbits; it's 'count' argument is always a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG,\nso we are not losing any information, and that way we can use the\nsame helper for all three bitmaps - compiler will see that count\nis a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG for the large ones, so it'll generate\nplain memcpy()+memset().\n\nReproducer added to tools/testing/selftests/core/close_range_test.c",

The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that\n   the copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means\n   the loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic\nlink size is not larger than expected.\n\n--\n\nV2: fix spelling mistake.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuserfaultfd: fix checks for huge PMDs\n\nPatch series \"userfaultfd: fix races around pmd_trans_huge() check\", v2.\n\nThe pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three different\nways depending on kernel version:\n\n1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit\n   the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with\n   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description\n   of the race scenario.\n   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even\n   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table\n   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case).\n2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for\n   detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.\n   On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly\n   wide race to hit this.\n   I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()\n   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86\n   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().\n3. On newer kernels (\u003e=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed\n   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),\n   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.\n\nI decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one\nfix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels\naffected by bugs 1+2.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThis fixes two issues.\n\nI discovered that the following race can occur:\n\n  mfill_atomic                other thread\n  ============                ============\n                              \u003czap PMD\u003e\n  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]\n  \u003cbail if trans_huge\u003e\n  \u003cif none:\u003e\n                              \u003cpagefault creates transhuge zeropage\u003e\n    __pte_alloc [no-op]\n                              \u003czap PMD\u003e\n  \u003cbail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)\u003e\n  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))\n\nI have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;\nthe BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.\n\nOn kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b (\"mm/pgtable: allow\npte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail\"), this can't lead to anything worse than\na BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to\ndeal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels\n(\u003c=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two\nBUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.\n\nThe second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types\nof huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs\n(in particular, migration PMDs).\n\nOn \u003c=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a\nPMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,\nfairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which\nassumes that the PMD points to a page table.\n\nBreakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will\ncrash or maybe worse if there is no \"struct page\" for the address bits in\nthe migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no\ncorresponding \"struct page\" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64\nlooks different).\n\nIf that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what\nit wrongly thinks is a page table.\n\nAs part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()\nbefore __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check for\nthat after the __pte_alloc() anyway.\n\nBackport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness\n\nIn sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,\nwhen running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the\nround-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active\nbulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.\n\nThis has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a\nhash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of\nthe hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,\nand if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host\nstate to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the\nhost(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is\nassigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host\nanymore, are incremented again).\n\nBack when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always\nenabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration\nflags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but\nthe *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious\ndecrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).\n\nAFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around\nhappens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in\nitself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this\nis harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is\nenabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first\nbe configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this\nmode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the\nqdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the\narray out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and\nused as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,\nwhich is quite impressive in its own right.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on\ndecrement as is used on increment.\n\nThe original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed\nin the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply\nbefore that.",

If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources\nbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later\ntime in its cmpl routine.\n\nAlso, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot\nscripts requiring longer timeouts.",

The erratum is the\nsame as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum\nperiod of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.\n\nHSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the\nHyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware\nhas more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message\n'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed\nwith a period \u003c 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum\nperiod of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.\nThe recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.\nBecause it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter.

This causes page cache operations to\nhang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,\ntruncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when\nan inode is evicted from memory, will hang.\n\nSecond, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. \nAs a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's\nfine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with\nNILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the \"sc_dirty_files\"\nlist, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,\ncorrupting the block mapping.\n\nFix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()\non failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),\nhaving it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and\ncorrecting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure\nthat the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix potential invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partition\n\nThe blk_add_partition() function initially used a single if-condition\n(IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This was\nmodified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the\nfunction to proceed without logging the error in this case. However,\nthis change unintentionally left a path where md_autodetect_dev()\ncould be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.\n\nThis commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the\ninitial if-condition, improving code readability and handling specific\nerror scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes the general\nerror case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of\nmd_autodetect_dev() calls.",

Previously,\nset_output_gamma was being checked for nullity at line 386, but then it\nwas being dereferenced without any nullity check at line 401.

The\nlatter indicates that it's okay to pass a pointer to uninitialized memory\nas the memory is written to anyway.\n\nHowever, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM\njust with additional alignment requirement.

If not then static_call_del_module()\ncauses a #GP as it blindly assumes that key::mods points to a valid struct\nstatic_call_mod.\n\nThe problem is that key::mods is not a individual struct member of struct\nstatic_call_key, it's part of a union to save space:\n\n        union {\n                /* bit 0: 0 = mods, 1 = sites */\n                unsigned long type;\n                struct static_call_mod *mods;\n                struct static_call_site *sites;\n\t};\n\nkey::sites is a pointer to the list of built-in usage sites of the static\ncall. The type of the pointer is differentiated by bit 0. A mods pointer\nhas the bit clear, the sites pointer has the bit set.\n\nAs static_call_del_module() blidly assumes that the pointer is a valid\nstatic_call_mod type, it fails to check for this failure case and\ndereferences the pointer to the list of built-in call sites, which is\nobviously bogus.\n\nCure it by checking whether the key has a sites or a mods pointer.\n\nIf it's a sites pointer then the key is not to be touched. As the sites are\nwalked in the same order as in __static_call_init() the site walk can be\nterminated because all subsequent sites have not been touched by the init\ncode due to the error exit.\n\nIf it was converted before the allocation fail, then the inner loop which\nsearches for a module match will find nothing.\n\nA fail in the second allocation in __static_call_init() is harmless and\ndoes not require special treatment. The first allocation succeeded and\nconverted the key to a module chain. That first entry has mod::mod == NULL\nand mod::next == NULL, so the inner loop of static_call_del_module() will\nneither find a module match nor a module chain. The next site in the walk\nwas either already converted, but can't match the module, or it will exit\nthe outer loop because it has a static_call_site pointer and not a\nstatic_call_mod pointer.",

The leak occurs when multiple\nthreads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to\ninconsistent state and potential memory leaks.\n\nTo fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing\nvf-\u003edefault_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(\u0026vsi-\u003emac_filter_hash_lock),\nensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.\n\nAdditionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(\u0026vsi-\u003emac_filter_hash_lock) in\ni40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.\n2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting\n\tportvlan and/or mac filters).\n3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the\n\tmac_filter_hash.\n\nThis synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents\nthe described leak.",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks\n\nbpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions\ncan take different parameters or return different return values. If\nprog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another\nkernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be\nbypassed.\n\nFor example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter\nand prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier\nassumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's\nprototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from\nthe bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent\nprog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,\nthe bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,\nthat is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.\n\nAnother example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,\nand BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier\nknows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for\nbpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal\nfor file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows\nprog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return\npositive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1\nfrom calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1\nwill be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.\nThat is, the return value rule is bypassed.\n\nThis patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses.",

Analyzing the core\ndump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved\non to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously\ndata-\u003etask. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in\ndata-\u003etask to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.\n\nWhat's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the\nwaitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding\nthat it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:\n\nrq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()\n==============================================================\nprepare_to_wait_exclusive()\n                                        data-\u003egot_token = true;\n                                        list_del_init(\u0026curr-\u003eentry);\nif (data.got_token)\n        break;\nfinish_wait(\u0026rqw-\u003ewait, \u0026data.wq);\n  ^- returns immediately because\n     list_empty_careful(\u0026wq_entry-\u003eentry)\n     is true\n... return, go do something else ...\n                                        wake_up_process(data-\u003etask)\n                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^\n\nNormally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.\nBut, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue\nentry has already been removed from the waitqueue.\n\nThe bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry\nAFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter\nand THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.\n\nFix it by swapping the order. We also need to use\nlist_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in\nfinish_wait().",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support\n\nThe simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are\nunsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for\nuse with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes\nwas added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely\naccess user memory.\n\nThere are three key problems:\n\n1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and\n   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as\n   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which\n   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.\n   lockup or panic()).\n\n2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when\n   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory\n   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor\n   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a\n   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.\n\n3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,\n   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.\n   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the\n   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the\n   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1\n   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first\n   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.\n\n   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is\n   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no\n   worse than (1).\n\n   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or\n   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but\n   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would\n   require either:\n\n   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the\n     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.\n\n   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such\n     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of\n     the TTBR address range.\n\n   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there\n   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error\n   pointers.\n\nPractically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have\nbeen no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it\nappears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with\nuprobes.\n\nAvoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW\n(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and\nsimulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR\n(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as\narm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can\nconsider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but\nthis will require more significant work.",

This\nis the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k\nPTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is\nset up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make\nsemantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).\n\nMore precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success\n(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly\n\"work\" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),\nbut it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the\ndirect map.\n\nNote that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems\nwhere can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with\nCONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and\nCONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent\nfailure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most\narm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be\naffected.\n\nFrom going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch\nseries, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the\nintended behavior [1] (preferred over having\nset_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in\nSIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between\nv16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201124164930.GK8537@kernel.org/\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210121122723.3446-11-rppt@kernel.org/#t\n[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201125092208.12544-10-rppt@kernel.org/",

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels\n\nThe arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't\nconvert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always\nlittle-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and\nsimulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding.

However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if\noverride_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  \n\nFor example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV\nsignal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the\nsignal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. \nThis prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and\nhandling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are\nunaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is\neffectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and\ncrashes, as we observed with java applications.\n\nFix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip\nthe comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively\nrestores the old behavior.",

Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the\n   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.\n2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.\n\nThe reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:\n1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the\n   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta\n   and node-\u003eback_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to\n   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,\n   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a\n   keyring.\n2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.\n   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as\n   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.\n3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT\n   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits\n   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that\n   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a\n   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points\n   to a shortcut.\n\n                      NODE A\n              +------\u003e+---+\n      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6\n      +---+   |       +---+\n      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6\n      +---+           +---+\n xxe6 | f |\n      +---+\n\n4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,\n   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read\n   out-of-bounds read.\n\nTo fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a\nshortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/1cfa878e-8c7b-4570-8606-21daf5e13ce7@huaweicloud.com/\n\n[jarkko: tweaked the commit message a bit to have an appropriate closes\n tag.]",

But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which\nwill block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.\nThis causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to\ncomplete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is\nsupposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.\nThis results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with\nthe write blocked starting a new write:\n\ntask:fio             state:D stack:0     pid:886   tgid:886   ppid:876\nCall trace:\n __switch_to+0x1d8/0x348\n __schedule+0x8e8/0x2248\n schedule+0x110/0x3f0\n percpu_rwsem_wait+0x1e8/0x3f8\n __percpu_down_read+0xe8/0x500\n io_write+0xbb8/0xff8\n io_issue_sqe+0x10c/0x1020\n io_submit_sqes+0x614/0x2110\n __arm64_sys_io_uring_enter+0x524/0x1038\n invoke_syscall+0x74/0x268\n el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x160/0x238\n do_el0_svc+0x44/0x60\n el0_svc+0x44/0xb0\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0x118/0x128\n el0t_64_sync+0x168/0x170\nINFO: task fsfreeze:7364 blocked for more than 15 seconds.\n      Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5-00063-g76aaf945701c #7963\n\nwith the attempting freezer stuck trying to grab the rwsem:\n\ntask:fsfreeze        state:D stack:0     pid:7364  tgid:7364  ppid:995\nCall trace:\n __switch_to+0x1d8/0x348\n __schedule+0x8e8/0x2248\n schedule+0x110/0x3f0\n percpu_down_write+0x2b0/0x680\n freeze_super+0x248/0x8a8\n do_vfs_ioctl+0x149c/0x1b18\n __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xd0/0x1a0\n invoke_syscall+0x74/0x268\n el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x160/0x238\n do_el0_svc+0x44/0x60\n el0_svc+0x44/0xb0\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0x118/0x128\n el0t_64_sync+0x168/0x170\n\nFix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a\nblocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue\nwhere IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will\nhave io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in\nturn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.\n\nSince freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isn't\nsomething that can be triggered by a regular user.",

Now things will go\nhorribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory\nregion, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be\ntriggered :(\n\nIn contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly\nas expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged\ndata and paged frags actually.\n\nThis patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index\nfor tx_q-\u003etx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.\n\nTested and verified on DWXGMAC CORE 3.20a",

But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm\ninternals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to\ncheck usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,\nwhich can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing\ncallers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).\n\nJust omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all\nof whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()\nwill tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no\nlonger has any callers (and will be deleted separately).\n\nSwapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio-\u003ememcg_data 0\nwithout checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;\nwhich is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg\n(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,\nwhen freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially\ncorrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0\nhere, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before\nresetting memcg_data.\n\nThat goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (\"mm: thp: make deferred split\nshrinker memcg aware\"): which included a check on swapcache before adding\nto deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to\nswapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim\n(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue\ncould have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (\"mm: split\nunderused THPs\") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes\nswapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.\n\nKeep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is\nno longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely\nto be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the\nqueue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.\n\nMemcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing\nfolio-\u003ememcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the\ndeferred list, sometimes corrupting \"from\" memcg's list, like swapout. \nRefcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be\nused in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:\nmem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting\nof course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving\ncharge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:\nnobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.\n\nThe 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list\nto another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);\nbut that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (\"mm: thp: don't need care\ndeferred split queue in memcg charge move path\"), which argued that the\nexistence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred\nlist.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.\n\nBackport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take\ncare that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There\nis not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.",
