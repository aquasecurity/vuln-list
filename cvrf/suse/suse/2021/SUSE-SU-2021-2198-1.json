This could lead to writing an arbitrary values (bsc#1186111).\n- CVE-2021-32399: Fixed a race condition when removing the HCI controller (bsc#1184611).\n- CVE-2020-36322: Fixed an issue was discovered in FUSE filesystem implementation which could have caused a system crash (bsc#1184211).\n- CVE-2021-29154: Fixed incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing arbitrary code execution (bsc#1184391).\n- CVE-2021-28660: Fixed an out of bounds write in rtw_wx_set_scan (bsc#1183593).\n- Fixed a data loss/data corruption that occurs if there is a write error on an md/raid array (bsc#1185847).\n",
