      "Text": "This update for the Linux Kernel 5.3.18-24_53_4 fixes several issues.\n\nThe following security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2021-33909: Fixed an out-of-bounds write in the filesystem layer that allows to andobtain full root privileges. (bsc#1188062)\n- CVE-2021-22555: Fixed an heap out-of-bounds write in net/netfilter/x_tables.c that could allow local provilege escalation. (bsc#1188116)\n- CVE-2020-36385: Fixed a use-after-free vulnerability reached via the ctx_list in some ucma_migrate_id situations where ucma_close is called. (bnc#1187050)\n- CVE-2021-23133: Fixed a race condition in the SCTP sockets that could lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service or an unprivileged process. (bnc#1184675)\n- CVE-2021-33034: Fixed a use-after-free vulnerability when destroying an hci_chan which leads to writing an arbitrary value. (bnc#1186111)\n- CVE-2021-32399: Fixed a race condition in net/bluetooth/hci_request.c for removal of the HCI controller. (bsc#1184611)\n- CVE-2020-36322: Fixed an issue in the FUSE filesystem implementation. This bug was addressed with a previous fix, which turned out was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as CVE-2021-28950. (bsc#1184211)\n- CVE-2021-29154: Fixed an incorrect computation of branch displacements in the BPF JIT compilers, which could allow to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. (bsc#1184391)\n- CVE-2021-3444: The bpf verifier did not properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when the source register was known to be 0. A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that could potentially lead to code execution. (bsc#1184170)\n- CVE-2021-28660: Fixed an out-of-bounds write in rtw_wx_set_scan which could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. (bsc#1183593)\n- CVE-2021-27365: Fixed an issue in certain iSCSI data structures that do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. (bsc#1182715)\n- CVE-2021-28688: Fixed some uninitialization pointers in Xen that could result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. (bsc#1183646)\n- CVE-2021-27363: Fixed a kernel pointer leak that can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. (bsc#1182716)\n- CVE-2021-27364: Fixed an issue that provides an unprivileged user the ability of craft Netlink messages. (bsc#1182717)\n",
