This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation (bnc#1192045).\n- CVE-2021-20322: Make the ipv4 and ipv6 ICMP exception caches less predictive to avoid information leaks about UDP ports in use.

This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.",
