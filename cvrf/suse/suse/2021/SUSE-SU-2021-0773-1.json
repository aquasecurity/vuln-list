(BOO#1116758)\n\n- Moved config man pages to a separate package: This way, they won't get installed on compute nodes.                                                                                                                                  \n\n- added correct link flags for perl bindings (bsc#1108671)\n  * perl:Switch is required by slurm torque wrappers\n\n- Fix Requires(pre) and Requires(post) for slurm-config and slurm-node.\n  This fixes issues with failing slurm user creation when installed during initial system installation. (bsc#1109373)\n\n- When using a remote shared StateSaveLocation, slurmctld needs to\n  be started after remote filesystems have become available.\n  Add 'remote-fs.target' to the 'After=' directive in slurmctld.service\n  (bsc#1103561).\n\n- Update to 17.11.8\n  * Fix incomplete RESPONSE_[RESOURCE|JOB_PACK]_ALLOCATION building path.\n  * Do not allocate nodes that were marked down due to the node not responding\n    by ResumeTimeout.\n  * task/cray plugin - search for 'mems' cgroup information in the file\n    'cpuset.mems' then fall back to the file 'mems'.\n  * Fix ipmi profile debug uninitialized variable.\n  * PMIx: fixed the direct connect inline msg sending.\n  * MYSQL: Fix issue not handling all fields when loading an archive dump.\n  * Allow a job_submit plugin to change the admin_comment field during\n    job_submit_plugin_modify().\n  * job_submit/lua - fix access into reservation table.\n  * MySQL - Prevent deadlock caused by archive logic locking reads.\n  * Don't enforce MaxQueryTimeRange when requesting specific jobs.\n  * Modify --test-only logic to properly support jobs submitted to more than\n    one partition.\n  * Prevent slurmctld from abort when attempting to set non-existing\n    qos as def_qos_id.\n  * Add new job dependency type of 'afterburstbuffer'. The pending job will be\n    delayed until the first job completes execution and it's burst buffer\n    stage-out is completed.\n  * Reorder proctrack/task plugin load in the slurmstepd to match that of\n    slurmd\n    and avoid race condition calling task before proctrack can introduce.\n  * Prevent reboot of a busy KNL node when requesting inactive features.\n  * Revert to previous behavior when requesting memory per cpu/node introduced\n    in 17.11.7.\n  * Fix to reinitialize previously adjusted job members to their original\n    value\n    when validating the job memory in multi-partition requests.\n  * Fix _step_signal() from always returning SLURM_SUCCESS.\n  * Combine active and available node feature change logs on one line rather\n    than one line per node for performance reasons.\n  * Prevent occasionally leaking freezer cgroups.\n  * Fix potential segfault when closing the mpi/pmi2 plugin.\n  * Fix issues with  --exclusive=[user|mcs] to work correctly\n    with preemption or when job requests a specific list of hosts.\n  * Make code compile with hdf5 1.10.2+\n  * mpi/pmix: Fixed the collectives canceling.\n  * SlurmDBD: improve error message handling on archive load failure.\n  * Fix incorrect locking when deleting reservations.\n  * Fix incorrect locking when setting up the power save module.\n  * Fix setting format output length for squeue when showing array jobs.\n  * Add xstrstr function.\n  * Fix printing out of --hint options in sbatch, salloc --help.\n  * Prevent possible divide by zero in _validate_time_limit().\n  * Add Delegate=yes to the slurmd.service file to prevent systemd from\n    interfering with the jobs' cgroup hierarchies.\n  * Change the backlog argument to the listen() syscall within srun to 4096\n    to match elsewhere in the code, and avoid communication problems at scale.\n\n  Fix race in the slurmctld backup controller which prevents it\n  to clean up allocations on nodes properly after failing over\n  (bsc#1084917).\n- Handled %license in a backward compatible manner.\n\n- Add a 'Recommends: slurm-munge' to slurm-slurmdbd.\n\n- Shield comments between script snippets with a %{!?nil:...} to\n  avoid them being interpreted as scripts - in which case the update\n  level is passed as argument (see chapter 'Shared libraries' in:\n  https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_scriptlet_snippets)\n  (bsc#1100850). \n\n- Update from 17.11.5 to 17.11.7\n- Fix security issue in handling of username and gid fields\n  CVE-2018-10995 and bsc#1095508 what implied an \n  update from 17.11.5 to 17.11.7\n  Highlights of 17.11.6:\n  * CRAY - Add slurmsmwd to the contribs/cray dir\n  * PMIX - Added the direct connect authentication.\n  * Prevent the backup slurmctld from losing the active/available node\n    features list on takeover.\n  * Be able to force power_down of cloud node even if in power_save state.\n  * Allow cloud nodes to be recognized in Slurm when booted out of band.\n  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.\n  Highlights of 17.11.7:\n  * Notify srun and ctld when unkillable stepd exits.\n  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.\n  * Fixes daemoniziation in newly introduced slurmsmwd daemon.\n- Rename:\n  * remain in sync with commit messages which introduced that file\n\n- Avoid running pretrans scripts when running in an instsys:\n  there may be not much installed, yet. pretrans code should\n  be done in lua, this way, it will be executed by the rpm-internal\n  lua interpreter and not be passed to a shell which may not be\n  around at the time this scriptlet is run (bsc#1090292).\n\n- Add requires for slurm-sql to the slurmdbd package.\n\n- Package READMEs for pam and pam_slurm_adopt.\n- Use the new %%license directive for COPYING file.\n  Fix interaction with systemd: systemd expects that a \n  daemonizing process doesn't go away until the PID file\n  with it PID of the daemon has bee written (bsc#1084125).\n\n- Make sure systemd services get restarted only when all\n  packages are in a consistent state, not in the middle\n  of an 'update' transaction (bsc#1088693).\n  Since the %postun scripts that run on update are from\n  the old package they cannot be changed - thus we work\n  around the restart breakage.\n\n- fixed wrong log file location in slurmdbd.conf and \n  fixed pid location for slurmdbd and made slurm-slurmdbd\n  depend on slurm config which provides the dir /var/run/slurm\n  (bsc#1086859).\n\n- added comment for (bsc#1085606) \n\n- Fix security issue in accounting_storage/mysql plugin by always escaping strings within the slurmdbd. CVE-2018-7033 (bsc#1085240).\n- Update slurm to v17.11.5 (FATE#325451)\n  Highlights of 17.11:\n  * Support for federated clusters to manage a single work-flow \n    across a set of clusters.\n  * Support for heterogeneous job allocations (various processor types,\n    memory sizes, etc. by job component). Support for heterogeneous job\n    steps within a single MPI_COMM_WORLD is not yet supported for most\n    configurations.\n  * X11 support is now fully integrated with the main Slurm code. Remove\n    any X11 plugin configured in your plugstack.conf file to avoid errors\n    being logged about conflicting options.\n  * Added new advanced reservation flag of 'flex', which permits jobs\n    requesting the reservation to begin prior to the reservation's \n    start time and use resources inside or outside of the reservation.\n    A typical use case is to prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the\n    reservation from using those reserved resources rather than forcing\n    jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources in the time\n    frame reserved.\n  * The sprio command has been modified to report a job's priority\n    information for every partition the job has been submitted to.\n  * Group ID lookup performed at job submit time to avoid lookup on\n    all compute nodes. Enable with PrologFlags=SendGIDs configuration\n    parameter.\n  * Slurm commands and daemons dynamically link to libslurmfull.so\n    instead of statically linking. This dramatically reduces the\n    footprint of Slurm.\n  * In switch plugin, added plugin_id symbol to plugins and wrapped\n    switch_jobinfo_t with dynamic_plugin_data_t in interface calls\n    in order to pass switch information between clusters with different\n    switch types.\n  * Changed default ProctrackType to cgroup.\n  * Changed default sched_min_interval from 0 to 2 microseconds.\n  * Added new 'scontrol write batch_script ' command to fetch a job's\n    batch script. Removed the ability to see the script as part of the \n    'scontrol -dd   show job' command.\n  * Add new 'billing' TRES which allows jobs to be limited based on the\n    job's billable TRES calculated by the job's partition's\n    TRESBillingWeights.\n  * Regular user use of 'scontrol top' command is now disabled. Use the\n    configuration parameter 'SchedulerParameters=enable_user_top' to\n    enable that functionality. The configuration parameter\n    'SchedulerParameters=disable_user_top' will be silently ignored.\n  * Change default to let pending jobs run outside of reservation after\n    reservation is gone to put jobs in held state. Added \n    NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER_END reservation flag to use old default.\n    Support for PMIx v2.0 as well as UCX support.\n  * Remove plugins for obsolete MPI stacks:\n    - lam\n    - mpich1_p4\n    - mpich1_shmem\n    - mvapich\n  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.\n  Replaced by sed script.\n- Fix some rpmlint warnings.\n\n- moved config files to slurm-config package (FATE#324574).\n\n- Moved slurmstepd and man page into slurm-node due to slurmd dependency\n- Moved config files into slurm-node\n- Moved slurmd rc scripts into slurm-node\n- Made slurm-munge require slurm-plugins instead of slurm itself\n  - slurm-node suggested slurm-munge, causing the whole slurm to be\n    installed.

To exploit this a user needs to anticipate or\n   cause the Prolog to fail for their job. CVE-2016-10030 (bsc#1018371).\n- Replace group/user add macros with function calls.\n- Fix array initialzation and ensure strings are always NULL terminated in\n-  pam_slurm.c (bsc#1007053).\n- Disable building with netloc support: the netloc API is part of the devel\n  branch of hwloc. Since this devel branch was included accidentally and has\n  been reversed since, we need to disable this for the time being.\n- Conditionalized architecture specific pieces to support non-x86 architectures\n  better.\n\n- Remove: unneeded 'BuildRequires:  python'\n- Add:\n  BuildRequires:  freeipmi-devel\n  BuildRequires:  libibmad-devel\n  BuildRequires:  libibumad-devel\n  so they are picked up by the slurm build.\n- Enable modifications from openHPC Project.\n- Enable lua API package build.\n- Add a recommends for slurm-munge to the slurm package:\n  This is way, the munge auth method is available and slurm\n  works out of the box.\n- Create /var/lib/slurm as StateSaveLocation directory.\n  /tmp is dangerous. \n\n- Create slurm user/group in preinstall script.\n\n- Keep %{_libdir}/libpmi* and %{_libdir}/mpi_pmi2* on SUSE.\n\n- Fix build with and without OHCP_BUILD define.\n- Fix build for systemd and non-systemd.\n\n- Updated to 16-05-5 - equvalent to OpenHPC 1.2.\n  * Fix issue with resizing jobs and limits not be kept track of correctly.\n  * BGQ - Remove redeclaration of job_read_lock.\n  * BGQ - Tighter locks around structures when nodes/cables change state.\n  * Make it possible to change CPUsPerTask with scontrol.\n  * Make it so scontrol update part qos= will take away a partition QOS from\n    a partition.\n  * Backfill scheduling properly synchronized with Cray Node Health Check.\n    Prior logic could result in highest priority job getting improperly\n    postponed.\n  * Make it so daemons also support TopologyParam=NoInAddrAny.\n  * If scancel is operating on large number of jobs and RPC responses from\n    slurmctld daemon are slow then introduce a delay in sending the cancel job\n    requests from scancel in order to reduce load on slurmctld.\n  * Remove redundant logic when updating a job's task count.\n  * MySQL - Fix querying jobs with reservations when the id's have rolled.\n  * Perl - Fix use of uninitialized variable in slurm_job_step_get_pids.\n  * Launch batch job requsting --reboot after the boot completes.\n  * Do not attempt to power down a node which has never responded if the\n    slurmctld daemon restarts without state.\n  * Fix for possible slurmstepd segfault on invalid user ID.\n  * MySQL - Fix for possible race condition when archiving multiple clusters\n    at the same time.\n  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.\n  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.\n  * Remove the SchedulerParameters option of 'assoc_limit_continue', making it\n    the default value. Add option of 'assoc_limit_stop'. If 'assoc_limit_stop'\n    is set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt\n    to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can\n    decrease system throughput and utlization, but avoid potentially starving\n    larger jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.\n  * Update a node's socket and cores per socket counts as needed after a node\n    boot to reflect configuration changes which can occur on KNL processors.\n    Note that the node's total core count must not change, only the distribution\n    of cores across varying socket counts (KNL NUMA nodes treated as sockets by\n    Slurm).\n  * Rename partition configuration from 'Shared' to 'OverSubscribe'. Rename\n    salloc, sbatch, srun option from '--shared' to '--oversubscribe'. The old\n    options will continue to function.

Also re-issue burst_buffer/pre-load operation\n    as needed.\n  * Move test for job wait reason value of BurstBufferResources and\n    BurstBufferStageIn later in the scheduling logic.\n  * Document which srun options apply to only job, only step, or job and step\n    allocations.\n  * Use more compatible function to get thread name (\u003e= 2.6.11).\n  * Make it so the extern step uses a reverse tree when cleaning up.\n  * If extern step doesn't get added into the proctrack plugin make sure the\n    sleep is killed.\n  * Add web links to Slurm Diamond Collectors (from Harvard University) and\n    collectd (from EDF).\n  * Add job_submit plugin for the 'reboot' field.\n  * Make some more Slurm constants (INFINITE, NO_VAL64, etc.) available to\n    job_submit/lua plugins.\n  * Send in a -1 for a taskid into spank_task_post_fork for the extern_step.\n  * MYSQL - Sightly better logic if a job completion comes in with an end time\n    of 0.\n  * task/cgroup plugin is configured with ConstrainRAMSpace=yes, then set soft\n    memory limit to allocated memory limit (previously no soft limit was set).\n  * Streamline when schedule() is called when running with message aggregation\n    on batch script completes.\n  * Fix incorrect casting when [un]packing derived_ec on slurmdb_job_rec_t.\n  * Document that persistent burst buffers can not be created or destroyed using\n    the salloc or srun --bb options.\n  * Add support for setting the SLURM_JOB_ACCOUNT, SLURM_JOB_QOS and\n    SLURM_JOB_RESERVAION environment variables are set for the salloc command.\n    Document the same environment variables for the salloc, sbatch and srun\n    commands in their man pages.\n  * Fix issue where sacctmgr load cluster.cfg wouldn't load associations\n    that had a partition in them.\n  * Don't return the extern step from sstat by default.\n  * In sstat print 'extern' instead of 4294967295 for the extern step.\n  * Make advanced reservations work properly with core specialization.\n  * slurmstepd modified to pre-load all relevant plugins at startup to avoid\n    the possibility of modified plugins later resulting in inconsistent API\n    or data structures and a failure of slurmstepd.\n  * Export functions from parse_time.c in libslurm.so.\n  * Export unit convert functions from slurm_protocol_api.c in libslurm.so.\n  * Fix scancel to allow multiple steps from a job to be cancelled at once.\n  * Update and expand upgrade guide (in Quick Start Administrator web page).\n  * burst_buffer/cray: Requeue, but do not hold a job which fails the pre_run\n    operation.\n  * Insure reported expected job start time is not in the past for pending jobs.\n  * Add support for PMIx v2.\n  Required for FATE#316379.\n\n- Setting 'download_files' service to mode='localonly'\n  and adding source tarball. (Required for Factory).\n\n- version 15.08.7.1\n  * Remove the 1024-character limit on lines in batch scripts.\n    task/affinity: Disable core-level task binding if more CPUs required than\n    available cores.\n  * Preemption/gang scheduling: If a job is suspended at slurmctld restart or\n    reconfiguration time, then leave it suspended rather than resume+suspend.\n  * Don't use lower weight nodes for job allocation when topology/tree used.\n  * Don't allow user specified reservation names to disrupt the normal\n    reservation sequeuece numbering scheme.\n  * Avoid hard-link/copy of script/environment files for job arrays. Use the\n    master job record file for all tasks of the job array.\n    NOTE: Job arrays submitted to Slurm version 15.08.6 or later will fail if\n    the slurmctld daemon is downgraded to an earlier version of Slurm.\n  * In slurmctld log file, log duplicate job ID found by slurmd. Previously was\n    being logged as prolog/epilog failure.\n  * If a job is requeued while in the process of being launch, remove it's\n    job ID from slurmd's record of active jobs in order to avoid generating a\n    duplicate job ID error when launched for the second time (which would\n    drain the node).\n  * Cleanup messages when handling job script and environment variables in\n    older directory structure formats.\n  * Prevent triggering gang scheduling within a partition if configured with\n    PreemptType=partition_prio and PreemptMode=suspend,gang.\n  * Decrease parallelism in job cancel request to prevent denial of service\n    when cancelling huge numbers of jobs.\n  * If all ephemeral ports are in use, try using other port numbers.\n  * Prevent 'scontrol update job' from updating jobs that have already finished.\n  * Show requested TRES in 'squeue -O tres' when job is pending.\n  * Backfill scheduler: Test association and QOS node limits before reserving\n    resources for pending job.\n  * Many bug fixes.\n- Use source services to download package.\n- Fix code for new API of hwloc-2.0.\n- package netloc_to_topology where avialable.\n- Package documentation.\n\n- version 15.08.3\n  * Many new features and bug fixes. See NEWS file \n- update files list accordingly\n- fix wrong end of line in some files\n\n- version 14.11.8\n  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file \n- update files list accordingly\n\n- add missing systemd requirements \n- add missing rclink\n\n- version 14.03.9\n  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file\n- add systemd support \n\n- version 14.03.6\n  * Added support for native Slurm operation on Cray systems\n    (without ALPS).\n  * Added partition configuration parameters AllowAccounts,\n    AllowQOS, DenyAccounts and DenyQOS to provide greater control\n    over use.\n  * Added the ability to perform load based scheduling. Allocating\n    resources to jobs on the nodes with the largest number if idle\n    CPUs.\n  * Added support for reserving cores on a compute node for system\n    services (core specialization)\n  * Add mechanism for job_submit plugin to generate error message\n    for srun, salloc or sbatch to stderr.\n  * Support for Postgres database has long since been out of date\n    and problematic, so it has been removed entirely.  If you\n    would like to use it the code still exists in \u003c= 2.6, but will\n    not be included in this and future versions of the code.\n  * Added new structures and support for both server and cluster\n    resources.\n  * Significant performance improvements, especially with respect\n    to job array support. \n- update files list\n\n- update to version 2.6.7\n  * Support for job arrays, which increases performance and ease of\n    use for sets of similar jobs.\n  * Job profiling capability added to record a wide variety of job\n    characteristics for each task on a user configurable periodic\n    basis. Data currently available includes CPU use, memory use,\n    energy use, Infiniband network use, Lustre file system use, etc.\n  * Support for MPICH2 using PMI2 communications interface with much\n    greater scalability.\n  * Prolog and epilog support for advanced reservations.\n  * Much faster throughput for job step execution with --exclusive\n    option. The srun process is notified when resources become\n    available rather than periodic polling.\n  * Support improved for Intel MIC (Many Integrated Core) processor.\n  * Advanced reservations with hostname and core counts now supports\n    asymmetric reservations (e.g. specific different core count for\n    each node).\n  * External sensor plugin infrastructure added to record power\n    consumption, temperature, etc.\n  * Improved performance for high-throughput computing.\n  * MapReduce+ support (launches ~1000x faster, runs ~10x faster).\n  * Added 'MaxCPUsPerNode' partition configuration parameter. This\n    can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node\n    can be associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. 'cpu' and\n    'gpu') and the partition/queue 'cpu' could be limited to only a\n    subset of the node's CPUs, insuring that one or more CPUs would\n    be available to jobs in the 'gpu' partition/queue.\n\n- version 2.5.7\n  * Fix for linking to the select/cray plugin to not give warning\n    about undefined variable.\n  * Add missing symbols to the xlator.h\n  * Avoid placing pending jobs in AdminHold state due to backfill\n    scheduler interactions with advanced reservation.\n  * Accounting - make average by task not cpu.\n  * POE - Correct logic to support poe option '-euidevice sn_all'\n    and '-euidevice sn_single'.\n  * Accounting - Fix minor initialization error.\n  * POE - Correct logic to support srun network instances count\n    with POE.\n  * POE - With the srun --launch-cmd option, report proper task\n    count when the --cpus-per-task option is used without the\n    --ntasks option.\n  * POE - Fix logic binding tasks to CPUs.\n  * sview - Fix race condition where new information could of\n    slipped past the node tab and we didn't notice.\n  * Accounting - Fix an invalid memory read when slurmctld sends\n    data about start job to slurmdbd.\n  * If a prolog or epilog failure occurs, drain the node rather\n    than setting it down and killing all of its jobs.\n  * Priority/multifactor - Avoid underflow in half-life calculation.\n  * POE - pack missing variable to allow fanout (more than 32\n    nodes)\n  * Prevent clearing reason field for pending jobs. This bug was\n    introduced in v2.5.5 (see 'Reject job at submit time ...').\n  * BGQ - Fix issue with preemption on sub-block jobs where a job\n    would kill all preemptable jobs on the midplane instead of just\n    the ones it needed to. \n  * switch/nrt - Validate dynamic window allocation size.\n  * BGQ - When --geo is requested do not impose the default\n    conn_types.\n  * RebootNode logic - Defers (rather than forgets) reboot request\n    with job running on the node within a reservation.\n  * switch/nrt - Correct network_id use logic. Correct support for\n    user sn_all and sn_single options.\n  * sched/backfill - Modify logic to reduce overhead under heavy\n    load.\n  * Fix job step allocation with --exclusive and --hostlist option.\n  * Select/cons_res - Fix bug resulting in error of 'cons_res: sync\n    loop not progressing, holding job #'\n  * checkpoint/blcr - Reset max_nodes from zero to NO_VAL on job\n    restart.\n  * launch/poe - Fix for hostlist file support with repeated host\n    names.\n  * priority/multifactor2 - Prevent possible divide by zero.\n    -- srun - Don't check for executable if --test-only flag is\n    used.\n  * energy - On a single node only use the last task for gathering\n    energy. Since we don't currently track energy usage per task \n    (only per step). Otherwise we get double the energy.\n\n- version 2.5.4\n  * Support for Intel® Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors.\n  * User control over CPU frequency of each job step.\n  * Recording power usage information for each job.\n  * Advanced reservation of cores rather than whole nodes.\n  * Integration with IBM's Parallel Environment including POE (Parallel\n    Operating Environment) and NRT (Network Resource Table) API.\n  * Highly optimized throughput for serial jobs in a new\n    'select/serial' plugin.\n  * CPU load is information available\n  * Configurable number of CPUs available to jobs in each SLURM\n    partition, which provides a mechanism to reserve CPUs for use\n    with GPUs.\n\n- remore runlevel 4 from init script thanks to patch1 \n- fix self obsoletion of slurm-munge package\n- use fdupes to remove duplicates \n- spec file reformaing\n\n- put perl macro in a better within install section \n\n- enable numa on x86_64 arch only \n\n- add numa and hwloc support\n\n- fix perl module files list \n\n- use perl_process_packlist macro for the perl files cleanup\n- fix some summaries length\n- add cgoups directory and example the cgroup.release_common file\n\n- spec file cleanup \n\n- first package\n\n",

That vulnerability could allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file on the system. Any exploitation of this is dependent on the user being able to cause or anticipate the failure (non-zero return code) of a Prolog script that their job would run on. This issue affects all Slurm versions from 0.6.0 (September 2005) to present. Workarounds to prevent exploitation of this are to either disable your Prolog script, or modify it such that it always returns 0 (\"success\") and adjust it to set the node as down using scontrol instead of relying on the slurmd to handle that automatically. If you do not have a Prolog set you are unaffected by this issue.",
