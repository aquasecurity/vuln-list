This could lead to writing an arbitrary values (bsc#1186111).\n- CVE-2021-28688: Fixed an issue introduced by XSA-365, leaving around zombie domains after xen guest has died (bsc#1183646).\n- CVE-2020-0429: In l2tp_session_delete and related functions of l2tp_core.c, there is possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with system execution privileges needed. (bsc#1176724).\n- Fixed a regression with the last livepatch which caused a kernel warning during sysfs read (bsc#1186235).\n",

      "Description": "The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11.",
