We now just use\n  the upstream runc package (it's stable enough and Docker no longer pins git\n  versions). docker-libnetwork is so unstable that it doesn't have any\n  versioning scheme and so it really doesn't make sense to maintain the project\n  as a separate package. bsc#1181641 bsc#1181677\n- Remove no-longer-needed patch for packaging now that we've dropped\n  docker-runc and docker-libnetwork.\n  - 0001-PACKAGING-revert-Remove-docker-prefix-for-containerd.patch\n- Update to Docker 20.10.2-ce.

While doing this, I've collapsed all patches into one branch\n  per-release and thus all the patches are now just one series:\n  - packaging-0001-revert-Remove-docker-prefix-for-containerd-and-runc-.patch\n  + 0001-PACKAGING-revert-Remove-docker-prefix-for-containerd.patch\n  - secrets-0001-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secrets.patch\n  + 0002-SECRETS-daemon-allow-directory-creation-in-run-secre.patch\n  - secrets-0002-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  + 0003-SECRETS-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch\n  - private-registry-0001-Add-private-registry-mirror-support.patch\n  + 0004-PRIVATE-REGISTRY-add-private-registry-mirror-support.patch\n  - bsc1073877-0001-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-on-start.patch\n  + 0005-bsc1073877-apparmor-clobber-docker-default-profile-o.patch\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- fix(shutdown): add timeout to umount calls (bsc#1178219)  * add 0624-shutdown-guard-against-read-only-run.patch\n  * add 0625-shutdown-sleep-a-little-if-a-process-was-killed.patch\n  * add 0626-fix-shutdown-add-timeout-to-umount-calls.patch\n- support network setup on infiniband devices (bsc#996146)\n  * add 0623-net-lib.sh-support-infiniband-network-mac-addresses.patch\n\nPackage gcc10 was updated:\n\n- SLE12 only, adjust gcc10-rpmlintrc to ignore bogus  libgcc_s1-gcc10.s390x: E: invalid-license (Badness: 100000)\n  GPL-3.0 WITH GCC-exception-3.1  [bsc#1185337]\n- Update to GCC 10.3.0 release (63fa67847628e5f358e7e2e7e), git1587\n- Disable nvptx offloading for aarch64 again since it doesn't work\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (892024d4af83b258801ff7484), git1574\n  * Includes GCC 10.3 RC1\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (592388d4f6e8a6adb470428fe), git1450\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (85977f624a34eac309f9d77a5), git1331\n  * Includes fix for [bsc#1182016]\n- The 32bit nvptx libgomp plugin is no longer built, do not attempt\n  to package it.\n- Remove include-fixed/pthread.h\n- Change GCC exception licenses to SPDX format\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (e563687cf9d3d1278f45aaebd), git1030\n  * Includes fix for firefox build [gcc#97918]\n- Do not specify alternate offload compiler location at\n  configure time.\n- Update README.First-for.SuSE.packagers\n- Install offload compilers for gcc10-testresults build\n- Enable fortran for offload compilers.\n- Add gcc10-amdgcn-llvm-as.patch to fix build of amdgcn offload\n  compiler with llvm11.\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (98ba03ffe0b9f37b4916ce6238), git958.\n  * Includes fix for memcpy miscompilation on aarch64.\n    [bsc#1178624, bsc#1178577]\n- Fix 32bit libgnat.so link.

When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.",

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2021-26932",
      "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c.",
