      "Text": "This update for nodejs12 fixes the following issues:\n\n- New upstream LTS version 12.20.1:\n  * CVE-2020-8265: use-after-free in TLSWrap (High) bug in TLS\n    implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket,\n    node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with\n    a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument.\n    If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is\n    passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure.\n    This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a\n    Denial of Service or potentially other exploits (bsc#1180553)\n  * CVE-2020-8287: HTTP Request Smuggling allow two copies of a\n    header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding\n    header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header\n    field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request\n    Smuggling (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/444.html).\n    (bsc#1180554)\n  * CVE-2020-1971: OpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference\n    (High) This is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited\n    through Node.js. (bsc#1179491)\n\n- New upstream LTS version 12.20.0:\n  * deps:\n    + update llhttp '2.1.2' -\u003e '2.1.3'\n    + update uv '1.39.0' -\u003e '1.40.0'\n    + update uvwasi '0.0.10' -\u003e '0.0.11'\n  * fs: add .ref() and .unref() methods to watcher classes\n  * http: added scheduling option to http agent\n  * module:\n    + exports pattern support\n    + named exports for CJS via static analysis\n  * n-api: add more property defaults (gh#35214)\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2020-1971",
      "Description": "The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).",
