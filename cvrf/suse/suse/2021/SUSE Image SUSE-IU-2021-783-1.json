(bsc#1174194)\n- 4.2.52\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- Fixed CVE-2021-25219:  The lame-ttl option controls how long named caches certain types\n  of broken responses from authoritative servers (see the security\n  advisory for details). This caching mechanism could be abused by\n  an attacker to significantly degrade resolver performance. The\n  vulnerability has been mitigated by changing the default value of\n  lame-ttl to 0 and overriding any explicitly set value with 0,\n  effectively disabling this mechanism altogether. ISC's testing has\n  determined that doing that has a negligible impact on resolver\n  performance while also preventing abuse.\n  Administrators may observe more traffic towards servers issuing\n  certain types of broken responses than in previous BIND 9 releases.\n  [bsc#1192146, CVE-2021-25219, bind-CVE-2021-25219.patch]\n\nPackage binutils was updated:\n\n- Add binutils-revert-hlasm-insns.diff for compatibility on old  code stream that expect 'brcl 0,label' to not be disassembled\n  as 'jgnop label' on s390x.  [bsc#1192267]\n- Rebase binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28523 aka boo#1188941.\n- Fix empty man-pages from broken release tarball [PR28144].\n- Update binutils-skip-rpaths.patch with contained a memory corruption\n  (boo#1191473).\n- Configure with --disable-x86-used-note on old code streams.\n- Disable libalternatives temporarily for build cycle reasons.\n- make TARGET-bfd=headers again, we patch bfd-in.h\n- This state submitted to SLE12 and SLE15 code streams for annual\n  toolchain update. [jsc#PM-2767, jsc#SLE-21561, jsc#SLE-19618]\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff to 66d5c7003, to include fixes for\n  PR28422, PR28192, PR28391.  Also adds some s390x arch14\n  instructions [jsc#SLE-18637].\n- Using libalternatives instead of update-alternatives.\n- Adjust for testsuite fails on older products that configure\n  binutils in different ways, adds  binutils-compat-old-behaviour.diff\n  and adjusts binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff and\n  binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff.\n- Bump binutils-2.37-branch.diff: fixes PR28138.\n- Use LTO \u0026amp; PGO build.\n- Update to binutils 2.37:\n  * The GNU Binutils sources now requires a C99 compiler and library to\n    build.\n  * Support for the arm-symbianelf format has been removed.\n  * Support for Realm Management Extension (RME) for AArch64 has been\n    added.\n  * A new linker option '-z report-relative-reloc' for x86 ELF targets\n    has been added to report dynamic relative relocations.\n  * A new linker option '-z start-stop-gc' has been added to disable\n    special treatment of __start_*/__stop_* references when\n  - -gc-sections.\n  * A new linker options '-Bno-symbolic' has been added which will\n    cancel the '-Bsymbolic' and '-Bsymbolic-functions' options.\n  * The readelf tool has a new command line option which can be used to\n    specify how the numeric values of symbols are reported.\n  - -sym-base=0|8|10|16 tells readelf to display the values in base 8,\n    base 10 or base 16.  A sym base of 0 represents the default action\n    of displaying values under 10000 in base 10 and values above that in\n    base 16.\n  * A new format has been added to the nm program.  Specifying\n    '--format=just-symbols' (or just using -j) will tell the program to\n    only display symbol names and nothing else.\n  * A new command line option '--keep-section-symbols' has been added to\n    objcopy and strip.  This stops the removal of unused section symbols\n    when the file is copied.  Removing these symbols saves space, but\n    sometimes they are needed by other tools.\n  * The '--weaken', '--weaken-symbol' and '--weaken-symbols' options\n    supported by objcopy now make undefined symbols weak on targets that\n    support weak symbols.\n  * Readelf and objdump can now display and use the contents of .debug_sup\n    sections.\n  * Readelf and objdump will now follow links to separate debug info\n    files by default.  This behaviour can be stopped via the use of the\n    new '-wN' or '--debug-dump=no-follow-links' options for readelf and\n    the '-WN' or '--dwarf=no-follow-links' options for objdump.  Also\n    the old behaviour can be restored by the use of the\n    '--enable-follow-debug-links=no' configure time option.\n    The semantics of the =follow-links option have also been slightly\n    changed.  When enabled, the option allows for the loading of symbol\n    tables and string tables from the separate files which can be used\n    to enhance the information displayed when dumping other sections,\n    but it does not automatically imply that information from the\n    separate files should be displayed.\n    If other debug section display options are also enabled (eg\n    '--debug-dump=info') then the contents of matching sections in both\n    the main file and the separate debuginfo file *will* be displayed.\n    This is because in most cases the debug section will only be present\n    in one of the files.\n    If however non-debug section display options are enabled (eg\n    '--sections') then the contents of matching parts of the separate\n    debuginfo file will *not* be displayed.  This is because in most\n    cases the user probably only wanted to load the symbol information\n    from the separate debuginfo file.  In order to change this behaviour\n    a new command line option --process-links can be used.  This will\n    allow di0pslay options to applied to both the main file and any\n    separate debuginfo files.\n  * Nm has a new command line option: '--quiet'.  This suppresses \u0026quot;/no\n    symbols\u0026quot;/ diagnostic.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1181452 aka CVE-2021-20197 aka PR26945\n  bnc#1183511 aka CVE-2021-20284 aka PR26931\n  bnc#1184519 aka CVE-2021-20294 aka PR26929\n  bnc#1184620 aka CVE-2021-3487 aka PR26946\n  bnc#1184794 aka CVE-2020-35448 aka PR26574\n- Also fixes:\n  bsc#1183909 - slow performance of stripping some binaries\n- Rebased patches: binutils-build-as-needed.diff, binutils-fix-abierrormsg.diff,\n  binutils-fix-invalid-op-errata.diff, binutils-fix-relax.diff,\n  binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff, binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Removed patches (are in upstream): ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch and\n  ppc-use-local-plt.patch.\n- Add binutils-2.37-branch.diff.gz.\n- ppc-ensure-undef-dynamic-weak-undefined.patch: PPC: ensure_undef_dynamic\n  on weak undef only in plt\n- ppc-use-local-plt.patch: PowerPC use_local_plt (prerequisite for above\n  patch)\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which fixes PR27587.\n- Do not run make TARGET-bfd=headers separately.\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff (includes fix for PR27441 aka bsc#1182252).\n- Bump 2.36 branch diff.\n- Update 2.36 branch diff which should fix PR27311 completely.\n  It fixes also PR27284.\n- Remove temporary fix 0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Add temporary upstream fix for PR27311\n  0001-PR27311-ld.bfd-symbol-from-plugin-undefined-referenc.patch.\n- Update to binutils 2.36:\n  New features in the Assembler:\n    General:\n  * When setting the link order attribute of ELF sections, it is now\n    possible to use a numeric section index instead of symbol name.\n  * Added a .nop directive to generate a single no-op instruction in\n    a target neutral manner.  This instruction does have an effect on\n    DWARF line number generation, if that is active.\n  * Removed --reduce-memory-overheads and --hash-size as gas now\n    uses hash tables that can be expand and shrink automatically.\n    X86/x86_64:\n  * Add support for AVX VNNI, HRESET, UINTR, TDX, AMX and Key\n    Locker instructions.\n  * Support non-absolute segment values for lcall and ljmp.\n  * Add {disp16} pseudo prefix to x86 assembler.\n  * Configure with --enable-x86-used-note by default for Linux/x86.\n    ARM/AArch64:\n  * Add support for Cortex-A78, Cortex-A78AE and Cortex-X1,\n    Cortex-R82, Neoverse V1, and Neoverse N2 cores.\n  * Add support for ETMv4 (Embedded Trace Macrocell), ETE (Embedded\n    Trace Extension), TRBE (Trace Buffer Extension), CSRE (Call\n    Stack Recorder Extension) and BRBE (Branch Record Buffer\n    Extension) system registers.\n  * Add support for Armv8-R and Armv8.7-A ISA extensions.\n  * Add support for DSB memory nXS barrier, WFET and WFIT\n    instruction for Armv8.7.\n  * Add support for +csre feature for -march. Add CSR PDEC\n    instruction for CSRE feature in AArch64.\n  * Add support for +flagm feature for -march in Armv8.4 AArch64.\n  * Add support for +ls64 feature for -march in Armv8.7\n    AArch64. Add atomic 64-byte load/store instructions for this\n    feature.\n  * Add support for +pauth (Pointer Authentication) feature for\n  - march in AArch64.\n    New features in the Linker:\n  * Add --error-handling-script=\u0026lt;NAME\u0026gt; command line option to allow\n    a helper script to be invoked when an undefined symbol or a\n    missing library is encountered.  This option can be suppressed\n    via the configure time switch: --enable-error-handling-script=no.\n  * Add -z x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} to the x86 ELF linker to mark\n    x86-64-{baseline|v[234]} ISA level as needed.\n  * Add -z unique-symbol to avoid duplicated local symbol names.\n  * The creation of PE format DLLs now defaults to using a more\n    secure set of DLL characteristics.\n  * The linker now deduplicates the types in .ctf sections.  The new\n    command-line option --ctf-share-types describes how to do this:\n    its default value, share-unconflicted, produces the most compact\n    output.\n  * The linker now omits the \u0026quot;/variable section\u0026quot;/ from .ctf sections\n    by default, saving space.  This is almost certainly what you\n    want unless you are working on a project that has its own\n    analogue of symbol tables that are not reflected in the ELF\n    symtabs.\n  New features in other binary tools:\n  * The ar tool's previously unused l modifier is now used for\n    specifying dependencies of a static library. The arguments of\n    this option (or --record-libdeps long form option) will be\n    stored verbatim in the __.LIBDEP member of the archive, which\n    the linker may read at link time.\n  * Readelf can now display the contents of LTO symbol table\n    sections when asked to do so via the --lto-syms command line\n    option.\n  * Readelf now accepts the -C command line option to enable the\n    demangling of symbol names.  In addition the --demangle=\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;,\n  - -no-demangle, --recurse-limit and --no-recurse-limit options\n    are also now availale.\n- Includes fixes for these CVEs:\n  bnc#1179898 aka CVE-2020-16590 aka PR25821\n  bnc#1179899 aka CVE-2020-16591 aka PR25822\n  bnc#1179900 aka CVE-2020-16592 aka PR25823\n  bnc#1179901 aka CVE-2020-16593 aka PR25827\n  bnc#1179902 aka CVE-2020-16598 aka PR25840\n  bnc#1179903 aka CVE-2020-16599 aka PR25842\n  bnc#1180451 aka CVE-2020-35493 aka PR25307\n  bnc#1180454 aka CVE-2020-35496 aka PR25308\n  bnc#1180461 aka CVE-2020-35507 aka PR25308\n- Rebase the following patches:\n  * binutils-fix-relax.diff\n  * binutils-revert-nm-symversion.diff\n  * binutils-revert-plt32-in-branches.diff\n- Add missing dependency on bc (ld.gold testsuite uses it).\n- Use --enable-obsolete for cross builds as ia64 is deprecated now.\n- Add binutils-2.36-branch.diff.gz.\n\nPackage blktrace was updated:\n\n- Fix crash due to dropped first event while using pipe input (bsc#1191788).  * blkparse: skip check_cpu_map with pipe input\n  * blkparse: fix incorrectly sized memset in check_cpu_map\n  * Added:\n  - blkparse-skip-check_cpu_map-with-pipe-input.patch\n  - blkparse-fix-incorrectly-sized-memset-in-check_cpu_m.patch\n\nPackage brotli was updated:\n\n- Fix CVE-2020-8927, decoder: integer overflow when input chunk  is larger than 2GiB.

vanilla kernel could not be used with zipl as\n  well as it's quite unexpected to not be able to boot when only a vanilla\n  kernel is installed.\n  Finally we now have a backup zipl kernel so if the

add upstream signing key and verify source signature\n- updated to 1.5.11 (bsc#1113013)\n  - Add keyring restriction support.\n  - Add KDF support to the Diffie-Helman function.\n  - DNS: Add support for AFS config files and SRV records\n\nPackage kmod was updated:\n\nPackage krb5 was updated:\n\n- Fix KDC null pointer dereference via a FAST inner body that  lacks a server field; (CVE-2021-37750); (bsc#1189929);\n- Added patches:\n  * 0012-Fix-KDC-null-deref-on-TGS-inner-body-null-server.patch\n\nPackage less was updated:\n\n- Add missing runtime dependency on which, which is used by lessopen.sh.  Fix bsc#1190552.\n\nPackage libcroco was updated:\n\n- Add libcroco-CVE-2020-12825.patch: limit recursion in block and  any productions (boo#1171685 CVE-2020-12825).\n\nPackage libsolv was updated:\n\n- fix misparsing of '\u0026amp;' in attributes with libxml2- choice rules: treat orphaned packages as newest [bsc#1190465]\n- fix compatibility with Python 3.10\n- new SOLVER_EXCLUDEFROMWEAK job type\n- support for environments in comps parser\n- bump version to 0.7.20\n- Disable python2 usage on suse_version \u0026gt;= 1550 by default (still\n  possible to use osc build --with=python).\n\nPackage libyui-ncurses-pkg was updated:\n\n- Fixed crash in NCurses online update when retracted packages  are present (bsc#1191130)\n- 2.50.8\n\nPackage libzypp was updated:\n\n- Disable logger in the child after fork (bsc#1192436)- version 17.28.8 (22)\n- Check log writer before accessing it (fixes #355, bsc#1192337)\n- Save locks: Update an existing locks changed comment string.\n- Allow uname-r format in purge kernels keepspec (fixes\n  openSUSE/zypper#418)\n- version 17.28.7 (22)\n- Zypper should keep cached files if transaction is aborted\n  (bsc#1190356)\n  Singletrans mode currently does not keep files around if the\n  transaction is aborted. This patch fixes the problem.\n- Require a minimum number of mirrors for multicurl (bsc#1191609)\n- Use procfs to detect nr of open fd's if rlimit is too high\n  (bsc#1191324)\n  Especially in a VM iterating over all possible fd's to close open\n  ones right before a exec() slows down zypper unnecessarily. This\n  patch uses /proc/self/fd to iterate over open fd's in case rlimit\n  is above 1024.\n- po: Fix some lost '%' signs in positional args (bsc#1191370)\n- RepoManager: Don't probe for plaindir repo if URL schema is\n  plugin: (bsc#1191286)\n- version 17.28.6 (22)\n- Downloader does not respect checkExistsOnly flag (bsc#1190712)\n  A missing check causes zyppng::Downloader to always download full\n  files even if the checkExistsOnly flag is set. This patch adds\n  the missing logic.\n- Fix kernel-*-livepatch removal in purge-kernels (bsc#1190815)\n  The kernel-*-livepatch packages are supposed to serve as a stable\n  handle for the ephemeral kernel livepatch packages. See\n  FATE#320268 for details. As part of the kernel live patching\n  ecosystem, kernel-*-livepatch packages should not block the\n  purge-kernels step.\n- version 17.28.5 (22)\n- Make sure to keep states alives while transitioning\n  (bsc#1190199)\n- May set techpreview variables for testing in /etc/zypp/zypp.conf.\n  If environment variables are unhandy one may enable the desired\n  techpreview in zypp.conf as well:\n    [main]\n    techpreview.ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1\n    techpreview.ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1\n- version 17.28.4 (22)\n- CMake/spec: Add option to force SINGLE_RPMTRANS as default for\n  zypper (fixes #340)\n- Make sure singleTrans is zypper-only for now.\n- Do not double check signatures and keys (bsc#1190059)\n- version 17.28.3 (22)\n- Workaround Bug 1189788: Don't allow ZYPP_SINGLE_RPMTRANS=1 on a\n  not UsrMerged Tumbleweed system.\n- version 17.28.2 (22)\n- Fix crashes in logging code when shutting down (bsc#1189031)\n- version 17.28.1 (22)\n- Rephrase vendor conflict message in case 2 packages are\n  involved (bsc#1187760)\n  This covers the case where not the packages itself would change\n  its vendor, but replaces a package from a different vendor.\n- Fix solver jobs for PTFs (bsc#1186503)\n- spec: switch to pkgconfig(openssl)\n- Show key fpr from signature when signature check fails\n  (bsc#1187224)\n  Rpm by default only shows the short key ID when checking the\n  signature of a package fails. This patch reads the signatures\n  from the RPM headers and replaces she short IDs with the key\n  fingerprints fetched from the signatures.\n- Implement alternative single transaction commit strategy.\n  This patch adds a experimental commit strategy that runs all\n  operations in a single rpm transaction, speeding up the execution\n  a lot.\n- Use ZYPP_MEDIANETWORK=1 to enable the experimental new media\n  backend.\n- Implement zchunk download, refactor Downloader backend.\n- Fix purge-kernels fails with kernels from Kernel:HEAD\n  (bsc#1187738)\n  There recently was a change in the kernel package naming scheme\n  in regards to rc kernels. Since kernel upstream uses characters\n  in the version that are not allowed in rpm versions a \u0026quot;/-rc\u0026quot;/ was\n  previously replaced with \u0026quot;/.rc\u0026quot;/ which broke sorting by version, to\n  fix this issue it was replaced with \u0026quot;/~rc\u0026quot;/, which unfortunately\n  broke the purge-kernels logic. This patch makes sure purge-kernel\n  does apply the same conversion.\n- version 17.28.0 (22)\n\nPackage lvm2 was updated:\n\n- vgextend crash when extending VG with missing PV (bsc#1191019)  + bug-1191019_vgextend-check-missing-device-during-block-size-chec.patch\n\nPackage man-pages was updated:\n\n- install kernel_lockdown.7 man page [bsc#1185534]- added sources\n  + kernel_lockdown.7\n\nPackage mozilla-nspr was updated:\n\n- update to version 4.32:  * implement new socket option PR_SockOpt_DontFrag\n  * support larger DNS records by increasing the default buffer\n    size for DNS queries\n- update to version 4.31:\n  * Lock access to PRCallOnceType members in PR_CallOnce* for\n    thread safety bmo#1686138\n- update to version 4.30\n  * support longer thread names on macOS\n  * fix a build failure on OpenBSD\n- update to version 4.29\n  * Remove macOS Code Fragment Manager support code\n  * Remove XP_MACOSX and OS_TARGET=MacOSX\n  * Refresh config.guess and config.sub\n  * Remove NSPR's patch to config.sub\n  * Add support for e2k target (64-bit Elbrus 2000)\n- update to version 4.28\n  * Fix a compiler warning\n  * Add rule for cross-compiling with cygwin\n- update to version 4.27\n  * the macOS platform code for shared library loading was\n  * An include statement for a Windows system library header\n    was added\n- update to version 4.26\n  * PR_GetSystemInfo supports a new flag PR_SI_RELEASE_BUILD to get\n    information about the operating system build version.\n  * Better support parallel building on Windows.\n  * The internal release automatic script requires python 3.\n\nPackage mozilla-nss was updated:\n\n- Mozilla NSS 3.68.1  MFSA 2021-51 (bsc#1193170)\n  * CVE-2021-43527 (bmo#1737470)\n    Memory corruption via DER-encoded DSA and RSA-PSS signatures\n- Remove now obsolete patch nss-bsc1193170.patch\n- Add patch to fix CVE-2021-43527 (bsc#1193170):\n  nss-bsc1193170.patch\n- Removed nss-fips-kdf-self-tests.patch.

(bsc#1172974, CVE-2020-14155)\n  * Tidy up left shifts to avoid sanitize warnings; also fix one NULL deference\n  in pcretest.\n- pcre 8.43\n  * In a pattern such as /[^x{100}-x{ffff}]*[x80-xff]/ which has a repeated\n  negative class with no characters less than 0x100 followed by a positive class\n  with only characters less than 0x100, the first class was incorrectly being\n  auto-possessified, causing incorrect match failures.\n  * If the only branch in a conditional subpattern was anchored, the whole\n  subpattern was treated as anchored, when it should not have been, since the\n  assumed empty second branch cannot be anchored. Demonstrated by test patterns\n  such as /(?(1)^())b/ or /(?(?=^))b/.\n  * Fix subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is disabled and X or R has\n  a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue was found by Yunho Kim.\n  (bsc#1172973 CVE-2019-20838)\n  * If a pattern started with a subroutine call that had a quantifier with a\n  minimum of zero, an incorrect \u0026quot;/match must start with this character\u0026quot;/ could be\n  recorded. Example: /(?\u0026amp;xxx)*ABC(?\u0026lt;xxx\u0026gt;XYZ)/ would (incorrectly) expect 'A' to\n  be the first character of a match.\n- pcre 8.42\n  * If a backreference with a minimum repeat count of zero was first in a\n  pattern, apart from assertions, an incorrect first matching character could be\n  recorded. For example, for the pattern /(?=(a))1?b/, \u0026quot;/b\u0026quot;/ was incorrectly set\n  as the first character of a match.\n  * Fix out-of-bounds read for partial matching of /./ against an empty string\n  when the newline type is CRLF.\n  * When matching using the the REG_STARTEND feature of the POSIX API with a\n  non-zero starting offset, unset capturing groups with lower numbers than a\n  group that did capture something were not being correctly returned as \u0026quot;/unset\u0026quot;/\n  (that is, with offset values of -1).\n  * Matching the pattern /(*UTF)C[^v]+x80/ against an 8-bit string\n  containing multi-code-unit characters caused bad behaviour and possibly a\n  crash. This issue was fixed for other kinds of repeat in release 8.37 by change\n  38, but repeating character classes were overlooked.\n\nPackage python-Babel was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2021-42771-rel-path-traversal.patch fixing  CVE-2021-42771 by cleaning locale identifiers before loading\n  from file (bsc#1185768).\n\nPackage python-base was updated:\n\n- Add CVE-2019-20907_tarfile-inf-loop.patch fixing bsc#1174091  (CVE-2019-20907, bpo#39017) avoiding possible infinite loop\n  in specifically crafted tarball.\n  Add recursion.tar as a testing tarball for the patch.\n- Provide the newest setuptools wheel (bsc#1176262,\n  CVE-2019-20916) in their correct form (bsc#1180686).\n- Add CVE-2020-26116-httplib-header-injection.patch fixing bsc#1177211\n  (CVE-2020-26116, bpo#39603) no longer allowing special characters in\n  the method parameter of HTTPConnection.putrequest in httplib, stopping\n  injection of headers.

Upstream changelog is available from  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2\n  * Fixed a failure to set CPU quota period in some cases on cgroup v1.\n  * Fixed the inability to start a container with the \u0026quot;/adding seccomp filter\n    rule for syscall ...\u0026quot;/ error, caused by redundant seccomp rules (i.e. those\n    that has action equal to the default one). Such redundant rules are now\n    skipped.\n  * Made release builds reproducible from now on.\n  * Fixed a rare debug log race in runc init, which can result in occasional\n    harmful \u0026quot;/failed to decode ...\u0026quot;/ errors from runc run or exec.\n  * Fixed the check in cgroup v1 systemd manager if a container needs to be\n    frozen before Set, and add a setting to skip such freeze unconditionally.\n    The previous fix for that issue, done in runc 1.0.1, was not working.\n- Update to runc v1.0.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.1\n  * Fixed occasional runc exec/run failure (\u0026quot;/interrupted system call\u0026quot;/) on an\n    Azure volume.\n  * Fixed \u0026quot;/unable to find groups ... token too long\u0026quot;/ error with /etc/group\n    containing lines longer than 64K characters.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v1: fix leaving cgroup frozen after Set if a parent cgroup is\n    frozen. This is a regression in 1.0.0, not affecting runc itself but some\n    of libcontainer users (e.g Kubernetes).\n  * cgroupv2: bpf: Ignore inaccessible existing programs in case of\n    permission error when handling replacement of existing bpf cgroup\n    programs. This fixes a regression in 1.0.0, where some SELinux\n    policies would block runc from being able to run entirely.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v2: don't freeze cgroup on Set.\n  * cgroup/systemd/v1: avoid unnecessary freeze on Set.\n- Remove upstreamed patches:\n  + boo1187704-0001-cgroupv2-ebpf-ignore-inaccessible-existing-programs.patch\n- Backport \u0026lt;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3055\u0026gt; to fix issues\n  with runc under openSUSE MicroOS's SELinux policy. boo#1187704\n  + boo1187704-0001-cgroupv2-ebpf-ignore-inaccessible-existing-programs.patch\n- Update to runc v1.0.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n  ! The usage of relative paths for mountpoints will now produce a warning\n    (such configurations are outside of the spec, and in future runc will\n    produce an error when given such configurations).\n  * cgroupv2: devices: rework the filter generation to produce consistent\n    results with cgroupv1, and always clobber any existing eBPF\n    program(s) to fix runc update and avoid leaking eBPF programs\n    (resulting in errors when managing containers).\n  * cgroupv2: correctly convert \u0026quot;/number of IOs\u0026quot;/ statistics in a\n    cgroupv1-compatible way.\n  * cgroupv2: support larger than 32-bit IO statistics on 32-bit architectures.\n  * cgroupv2: wait for freeze to finish before returning from the freezing\n    code, optimize the method for checking whether a cgroup is frozen.\n  * cgroups/systemd: fixed \u0026quot;/retry on dbus disconnect\u0026quot;/ logic introduced in rc94\n  * cgroups/systemd: fixed returning \u0026quot;/unit already exists\u0026quot;/ error from a systemd\n    cgroup manager (regression in rc94)\n  + cgroupv2: support SkipDevices with systemd driver\n  + cgroup/systemd: return, not ignore, stop unit error from Destroy\n  + Make \u0026quot;/runc --version\u0026quot;/ output sane even when built with go get or\n    otherwise outside of our build scripts.\n  + cgroups: set SkipDevices during runc update (so we don't modify\n    cgroups at all during runc update).\n  + cgroup1: blkio: support BFQ weights.\n  + cgroupv2: set per-device io weights if BFQ IO scheduler is available.\n- Update to runc v1.0.0~rc95. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95\n  This release of runc contains a fix for CVE-2021-30465, and users are\n  strongly recommended to update (especially if you are providing\n  semi-limited access to spawn containers to untrusted users). bsc#1185405\n- Update to runc v1.0.0~rc94. Upstream changelog is available from\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc94\n  Breaking Changes:\n  * cgroupv1: kernel memory limits are now always ignored, as kmemcg has\n    been effectively deprecated by the kernel.

Conditionals in the roff source are now used\n    instead. This fixes corruption of the sudo manual on systems without BSD\n    login classes. Bug #861.\n  * If an I/O logging plugin is configured but the plugin does not actually\n    log any I/O, sudo will no longer force the command to be run in a pseudo-tty.\n  * In visudo, it is now possible to specify the path to sudoers without\n    using the -f option. Bug #864.\n  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.22 where the utmp (or utmpx) file\n    would not be updated when a command was run in a pseudo-tty. Bug #865.\n  * Sudo now sets the silent flag when opening the PAM session except when\n    running a shell via sudo -s or sudo -i. This prevents the pam_lastlog\n    module from printing the last login information for each sudo command.\n    Bug #867.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.26 and 1.8.25p1:\n  * Fixed a bug in cvtsudoers when converting to JSON format when alias\n    expansion is enabled. Bug #853.\n  * Sudo no long sets the USERNAME environment variable when running\n    commands. This is a non-standard environment variable that was set on\n    some older Linux systems.\n  * Sudo now treats the LOGNAME and USER environment variables (as well as\n    the LOGIN variable on AIX) as a single unit. If one is preserved or removed\n    from the environment using env_keep, env_check or env_delete, so is the\n    other.\n  * Added support for OpenLDAP's TLS_REQCERT setting in ldap.conf.\n  * Sudo now logs when the command was suspended and resumed in the I/O logs.\n    This information is used by sudoreplay to skip the time suspended when\n    replaying the session unless the new -S flag is used.\n  * Fixed documentation problems found by the igor utility. Bug #854.\n  * Sudo now prints a warning message when there is an error or end of file\n    while reading the password instead of exiting silently.\n  * Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end parsing the command_timeout,\n    role, type, privs and limitprivs sudoOptions. This also affected cvtsudoers\n    conversion from LDIF to sudoers or JSON.\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented timeout settings in sudoers from functioning\n    unless a timeout was also specified on the command line.\n  * Asturian translation for sudo from translationproject.org.\n  * When generating LDIF output, cvtsudoers can now be configured to pad the\n    sudoOrder increment such that the start order is used as a prefix. Bug #856.\n  * If the user specifies a group via sudo's -g option that matches any of\n    the target user's groups, it is now allowed even if no groups are present\n    in the Runas_Spec. Previously, it was only allowed if it matched the target\n    user's primary group.\n  * The sudoers LDAP back-end now supports negated sudoRunAsUser and\n    sudoRunAsGroup entries.\n  * Sudo now provides a proper error message when the \u0026quot;/fqdn\u0026quot;/ sudoers option\n    is set and it is unable to resolve the local host name. Bug #859.\n  * Portuguese translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.\n  * Sudo now includes sudoers LDAP schema for the on-line configuration\n    supported by OpenLDAP.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.25p1 and 1.8.25:\n  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that caused a crash on systems that\n    have the poll() function but not the ppoll() function. Bug #851.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.25 and 1.8.24:\n  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.20 that broke formatting of I/O log\n    timing file entries on systems without a C99-compatible snprintf()\n    function. Our replacement snprintf() doesn't support floating point so we\n    can't use the %f format directive.\n  * I/O log timing file entries now use a monotonic timer and include\n    nanosecond precision. A monotonic timer that does not increment while the\n    system is sleeping is used where available.\n  * When sudo runs a command in a pseudo-tty, the slave device is now closed\n    in the main process immediately after starting the monitor process. This\n    removes the need for an AIX-specific workaround that was added in sudo 1.8.24.\n  * Fixed a bug displaying timeout values the \u0026quot;/sudo -V\u0026quot;/ output. The value\n    displayed was 3600 times the actual value. Bug #846.\n  * The testsudoers utility now supports querying an LDIF-format policy.\n  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 where the LDAP and SSSD\n    backends evaluated the rules in reverse sudoOrder. Bug #849.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.24 and 1.8.23:\n  * The LDAP and SSS back-ends now use the same rule evaluation code as the\n    sudoers file backend. This builds on the work in sudo 1.8.23 where the\n    formatting functions for sudo -l output were shared. The handling of\n    negated commands in SSS and LDAP is unchanged.\n  * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.8.23 where sudo -i could not be used\n    in conjunction with --preserve-env=VARIABLE. Bug #835.\n  * cvtsudoers can now parse base64-encoded attributes in LDIF files.\n  * Random insults are now more random.\n  * Added SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY flag for conversation function to tell sudo to\n    try writing to /dev/tty first. Can be used in conjunction with SUDO_CONV_\n    INFO_MSG and SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG.\n  * Fixed typos in the OpenLDAP sudo schema. Bugs #839 and #840. Bug #839 and\n    bug #840.\n  * Fixed a race condition when building with parallel make. Bug #842.\n  * Fixed a duplicate free when netgroup_base in ldap.conf is set to an\n    invalid value.\n  * On systems using PAM, sudo now ignores the PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD and\n    PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED errors from PAM account management if authentication is\n    disabled for the user. This fixes a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23.\n    Bug #843.\n  * Fixed an ambiguity in the sudoers manual in the description and\n    definition of User, Runas, Host, and Cmnd Aliases. Bug #834.\n  * Fixed a bug that resulted in only the first window size change event\n    being logged.\n  * Fixed a compilation problem on systems that define O_PATH or O_SEARCH in\n    fnctl.h but do not define O_DIRECTORY. Bug #844.\n  - Major changes between version 1.8.23 and 1.8.22:\n  * PAM account management modules and BSD auth approval modules are now run\n    even when no password is required.\n  * For kernel-based time stamps, if no terminal is present, fall back to\n    parent-pid style time stamps.\n  * The new cvtsudoers utility replaces both the sudoers2ldif script and the\n    visudo -x functionality. It can read a file in either sudoers or LDIF\n    format and produce JSON, LDIF or sudoers output. It is also possible to\n    filter the generated output file by user, group or host name.\n  * The file, ldap and sss sudoers backends now share a common set of\n    formatting functions for \u0026quot;/sudo -l\u0026quot;/ output, which is also used by the\n    cvtsudoers utility.\n  * The /run directory is now used in preference to /var/run if it exists.\n    Bug #822.\n  * More accurate descriptions of the --with-rundir and --with-vardir\n    configure options. Bug #823.\n  * The setpassent() and setgroupent() functions are now used on systems that\n    support them to keep the passwd and group database open. Sudo performs a\n    lot of passwd and group lookups so it can be beneficial to avoid opening\n    and closing the files each time.\n  * The new case_insensitive_user and case_insensitive_group sudoers options\n    can be used to control whether sudo does case-sensitive matching of users\n    and groups in sudoers. Case insensitive matching is now the default.\n  * Fixed a bug on some systems where sudo could hang on command exit when\n    I/O logging was enabled. Bug #826.\n  * Fixed a problem with the process start time test in make check when run\n    in a Linux container. The test now uses the \u0026quot;/btime\u0026quot;/ field in /proc/stat to\n    get the system start time instead of using /proc/uptime, which is the\n    container uptime. Bug #829.\n  * When determining which temporary directory to use, sudoedit now checks\n    the directory for writability before using it. Previously, sudoedit only\n    performed an existence check. Bug #827.\n  * Sudo now includes an optional set of Monty Python-inspired insults.\n  * Chinese (Taiwan) translation for sudo from translationproject.org.\n- Add sudo-1.8.27-ipa_hostname.patch to fix special handling of\n  ipa_hostname that was lost in sudo 1.8.24.\n  We now include the long and short hostname in sudo parser container\n  [bsc#1181371]\n- Restore sudo ldap behavior to ignore expire

      "CVE": "CVE-2021-3712",
      "Description": "ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).",

A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories.",
