It has been\n  unsupported since version 3.0.3, FATE#313101 (bsc#1176973).\n- 4.2.46\n\nPackage avahi was updated:\n\n- Add avahi-CVE-2021-3468.patch: avoid infinite loop by handling  HUP event in client_work (boo#1184521 CVE-2021-3468).\n  https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/pull/330\n\nPackage bash was updated:\n\n- Add patch bsc1183064.patch  * Fix bug bsc#1183064: Segfault from reading a history file not\n    starting with # with HISTTIMEFORMAT set and history_multiline_entries\n    nonzero and with the history cleared and read on the same input line.\n\nPackage bind was updated:\n\n- * A broken inbound incremental zone update (IXFR)    can cause named to terminate unexpectedly\n    [CVE-2021-25214, bind-CVE-2021-25214.patch]\n  * An assertion check can fail while answering queries\n    for DNAME records that require the DNAME to be processed to resolve\n    itself\n    [CVE-2021-25215, bind-CVE-2021-25215.patch]\n  * A second vulnerability in BIND's GSSAPI security\n    policy negotiation can be targeted by a buffer overflow attack\n    This does not affect this package as the affected code is\n    disabled.\n    [CVE-2021-25216]\n  [bsc#1185345]\n- pass PIE compiler and linker flags via environment variables to make\n  /usr/bin/delv in bind-tools also position independent (bsc#1183453).\n- drop pie_compile.diff: no longer needed, this patch is difficult to\n  maintain, the environment variable approach is less error prone.\n  [bsc#1183453, bind.spec, pie_compile.diff]\n\nPackage chrony was updated:\n\n- boo#1162964, clknetsim-glibc-2.31.patch:  Fix build with glibc-2.31\n- bsc#1184400, chrony-pidfile.patch:\n  Use /run instead of /var/run for PIDFile in chronyd.service.\n\nPackage cifs-utils was updated:\n\n- cifs.upcall: fix regression in kerberos mount; (bsc#1184815).  * add 0015-cifs.upcall-fix-regression-in-kerberos-mount.patch\n- CVE-2021-20208: cifs-utils: cifs.upcall kerberos auth leak in\n  container; (bsc#1183239); CVE-2021-20208.\n\nPackage cloud-regionsrv-client was updated:\n\n- Update to version 9.1.5 (bsc#1182779, bsc#1185234, bsc#1185198)  + Another startup process may run zypper before the registration process\n    if zypper is still running we cannot get the lock and as such\n    the installed products cannot be determined. Wait for the lock to be\n    released for up to 30 seconds.\n  + On any error durring product list generation return a list to avoid\n    a traceback by trying to iterate over None\n\nPackage cups was updated:\n\n- When cupsd creates directories with specific owner group  and permissions (usually owner is 'root' and group matches\n  \u0026quot;/configure --with-cups-group=lp\u0026quot;/) specify same owner group and\n  permissions in the RPM spec file to ensure those directories\n  are installed by RPM with the right settings because if those\n  directories were installed by RPM with different settings then\n  cupsd would use them as is and not adjust its specific owner\n  group and permissions which could lead to privilege escalation\n  from 'lp' user to 'root' via symlink attacks e.g. if owner is\n  falsely 'lp' instead of 'root' CVE-2021-25317 (bsc#1184161)\n- cups-2.2.7-web-ui-kerberos-authentication.patch (bsc#1175960)\n  Fix web UI kerberos authentication\n\nPackage curl was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1186114, CVE-2021-22898]  * TELNET stack contents disclosure\n- Add curl-CVE-2021-22898.patch\n- Allow partial chain verification [jsc#SLE-17956]\n  * Have intermediate certificates in the trust store be treated\n    as trust-anchors, in the same way as self-signed root CA\n    certificates are. This allows users to verify servers using\n    the intermediate cert only, instead of needing the whole chain.\n  * Set FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST unconditionally.\n  * Do not check partial chains with CRL check.\n- Add curl-X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1183934, CVE-2021-22890]\n  * When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse\n    session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as\n    if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly\n    \u0026quot;/short-cut\u0026quot;/ the host handshake.\n- Add curl-CVE-2021-22890.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1183933, CVE-2021-22876]\n  * The automatic referer leaks credentials\n- Add curl-CVE-2021-22876.patch\n\nPackage dhcp was updated:\n\n- Oops, when upgrading to 4.3.6-P1 in 2018 only isc_version was  bumped, but not the RPM package version.\n- CVE-2021-25217, bsc#1186382, dhcp-CVE-2021-25217.patch: A buffer\n  overrun in lease file parsing code can be used to exploit a\n  common vulnerability shared by dhcpd and dhclient.\n- bsc#1185157:\n  Use /run instead of /var/run for PIDFile in dhcrelay.service.\n\nPackage dracut was updated:\n\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.188.gbf445638:  * 90kernel-modules-extra: don't resolve symlinks before instmod (bsc#1185277)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.187.g63c1504f:\n  * fix(shutdown): add timeout to umount calls (bsc#1178219)\n- Update to version 049.1+suse.186.g320cc3d1:\n  * network-legacy: fix route parsing issues in ifup (bsc#1182688)\n  * 90kernel-modules: arm/arm64: Add reset controllers\n  * Prevent creating unexpected files on the host when running dracut\n  * As of v246 of systemd \u0026quot;/syslog\u0026quot;/ and \u0026quot;/syslog-console\u0026quot;/ switches have been deprecated\n\nPackage e2fsprogs was updated:\n\nPackage efivar was updated:\n\n- Add efivar-bsc1181967-fix-nvme-parsing.patch to fix the NVME  path parsing (bsc#1181967)\n\nPackage expect was updated:\n\n- bsc#1183904, expect-errorfd.patch:  errorfd file descriptors should be closed when forking\n- fix previous change regarding PIE linking. Passing SHLIB_CFLAGS=\u0026quot;/-shared\u0026quot;/\n  causes /usr/bin/expect to become a shared library that SEGFAULTs upon\n  execution. Instead use SHLIB_LD to pass -shared only to shared library\n  linking.\n- pass explicit -pie flag to CFLAGS and hack `make` invocation so that\n  /usr/bin/expect actually becomes a PIE binary. This is especially awkard\n  since the expect build system implicitly passes -fPIC which breaks our\n  gcc-PIE package, but does not pass -pie while linking the executable.\n  Shared libraries are also not linked with -shared so we need to explicitly\n  pass this, too, to avoid build breakage (bsc#1184122).\n- Add an unversioned symlink to make linking easier for\n  applications that use libexpect without Tcl (boo#1172681).\n- New version 5.45.4:\n  * Fix two bugs in EOF handling.\n\nPackage filesystem was updated:\n\n- Remove duplicate line due to merge error- add /etc/skel/.cache with perm 0700 (bsc#1181011)\n- Set correct permissions when creating /proc and /sys\n- Ignore postfix user (pulled in from buildsystem)\n- /proc and /sys should be %ghost to allow filesystem package updates in\n  rootless container environments (rh#1548403) (bsc#1146705)\n- Split /var/tmp out of fs-var.conf, new file is fs-var-tmp.conf.\n  Allows to override config to add cleanup options of /var/tmp\n  [bsc#1078466]\n- Create fs-tmp.conf to cleanup /tmp regular (required with tmpfs)\n  [bsc#1175519]\n- Fix bug about missing group in tmpfiles.d files\n- Generic cleanup:\n  - Remove /usr/local/games\n\nPackage gcc10 was updated:\n\n- Update to GCC 10.3.0 release (63fa67847628e5f358e7e2e7e), git1587- Disable nvptx offloading for aarch64 again since it doesn't work\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (892024d4af83b258801ff7484), git1574\n  * Includes GCC 10.3 RC1\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (592388d4f6e8a6adb470428fe), git1450\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (85977f624a34eac309f9d77a5), git1331\n  * Includes fix for [bsc#1182016]\n- The 32bit nvptx libgomp plugin is no longer built, do not attempt\n  to package it.\n- Remove include-fixed/pthread.h\n- Change GCC exception licenses to SPDX format\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (e563687cf9d3d1278f45aaebd), git1030\n  * Includes fix for firefox build [gcc#97918]\n- Do not specify alternate offload compiler location at\n  configure time.\n- Update README.First-for.SuSE.packagers\n- Install offload compilers for gcc10-testresults build\n- Enable fortran for offload compilers.\n- Add gcc10-amdgcn-llvm-as.patch to fix build of amdgcn offload\n  compiler with llvm11.\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (98ba03ffe0b9f37b4916ce6238), git958.\n  * Includes fix for memcpy miscompilation on aarch64.\n    [bsc#1178624, bsc#1178577]\n- Fix 32bit libgnat.so link.  [bsc#1178675]\n- prepare usrmerge: Install libgcc_s into %_libdir. ABI wise it\n  stays /%lib. (boo#1029961)\n- Update to gcc-10 branch head (a78cd759754c92cecbf235ac9b), git872.\n- Build complete set of multilibs for arm-none target [bsc#1106014]\n  * Fixes inadvertant mixture of ARM and Thumb instructions in linker output\n\nPackage glib2 was updated:\n\n- Add glib2-CVE-2021-27218.patch: g_byte_array_new_take takes a  gsize as length but stores in a guint, this patch will refuse if\n  the length is larger than guint. (bsc#1182328,\n  glgo#GNOME/glib!1944)\n- Add glib2-CVE-2021-27219-add-g_memdup2.patch: g_memdup takes a\n  guint as parameter and sometimes leads into an integer overflow,\n  so add a g_memdup2 function which uses gsize to replace it.\n  (bsc#1182362, glgo#GNOME/glib!1927, glgo#GNOME/glib!1933,\n  glgo#GNOME/glib!1943)\n\nPackage gnutls was updated:\n\n- Security fix: [bsc#1183456, CVE-2021-20232]  * A use after free issue in client_send_params\n    in lib/ext/pre_shared_key.c may lead to memory\n    corruption and other potential consequences.\n- Add gnutls-CVE-2021-20232.patch\n- Security fix: [bsc#1183457, CVE-2021-20231]\n  * A use after free issue in client sending key_share extension\n    may lead to memory corruption and other consequences.\n- Add gnutls-CVE-2021-20231.patch\n\nPackage google-guest-agent was updated:\n\n- Update to version 20210414.00 (bsc#1185848, bsc#1185849)  * start sshd (#106)\n  * Add systemd-networkd.service restart dependency.

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.",

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.",

In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery.
