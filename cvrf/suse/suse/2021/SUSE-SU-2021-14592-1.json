      "Text": "This update for clamav fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update to 0.103.0 to implement jsc#ECO-3010 and bsc#1118459\n- This update incorporates incompatible changes that were introduced\n  in version 0.101.0.\n- Accumulated security fixes:\n  * CVE-2020-3350: Fix a vulnerability wherein a malicious user could\n    replace a scan target's directory with a symlink to another path\n    to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or clamonacc into removing or moving\n    a different file (eg. a critical system file). The issue would\n    affect users that use the --move or --remove options for clamscan,\n    clamdscan, and clamonacc. (bsc#1174255)\n  * CVE-2020-3327: Fix a vulnerability in the ARJ archive parsing\n    module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a Denial-of-Service\n    (DoS) condition. Improper bounds checking results in an\n    out-of-bounds read which could cause a crash. The previous fix for\n    this CVE in 0.102.3 was incomplete. This fix correctly resolves\n    the issue.\n  * CVE-2020-3481: Fix a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in\n    ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n    condition. Improper error handling may result in a crash due to a\n    NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for\n    those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the\n    file type signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive\n    parser in versions affected by the vulnerability. (bsc#1174250)\n  * CVE-2020-3341: Fix a vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in\n    ClamAV 0.101 - 0.102.2 that could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS)\n    condition. Improper size checking of a buffer used to initialize AES\n    decryption routines results in an out-of-bounds read which may cause\n    a crash. (bsc#1171981)\n  * CVE-2020-3123: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition may occur when\n    using the optional credit card data-loss-prevention (DLP) feature.\n    Improper bounds checking of an unsigned variable resulted in an\n    out-of-bounds read, which causes a crash.\n",
