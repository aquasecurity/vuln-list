      "Text": "This update for apache2 fixes the following issues:\n\n* CVE-2019-0220: The Apache HTTP server did not use a consistent strategy for\n  URL normalization throughout all of its components. In particular,\n  consecutive slashes were not always collapsed. Attackers could potentially\n  abuse these inconsistencies to by-pass access control mechanisms and thus\n  gain unauthorized access to protected parts of the service. [bsc#1131241]\n* CVE-2019-0217: A race condition in Apache's 'mod_auth_digest' when running in\n  a threaded server could have allowed users with valid credentials to\n  authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control\n  restrictions. [bsc#1131239]\n* CVE-2019-0211: A flaw in the Apache HTTP Server allowed less-privileged child\n  processes or threads to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n  parent process. Attackers with control over CGI scripts or extension modules\n  run by the server could have abused this issue to potentially gain super user\n  privileges. [bsc#1131233]\n* CVE-2019-0197: When HTTP/2 support was enabled in the Apache server for a\n  'http' host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a 'https' host, an Upgrade\n  request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request on a\n  connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. This issue could have\n  been abused to mount a denial-of-service attack. Servers that never enabled\n  the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did not configure the\n  'H2Upgrade on' are unaffected. [bsc#1131245]\n* CVE-2019-0196: Through specially crafted network input the Apache's http/2\n  request handler could be lead to access previously freed memory while\n  determining the method of a request. This resulted in the request being\n  misclassified and thus being processed incorrectly. [bsc#1131237]\n\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update update project.",
