An attacker within range of\n  the Access Point and client could have abused the vulnerability to recover\n  sensitive information (bsc#1104205).\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n\n- Enabled PWD as EAP method. This allows for password-based authentication,\n  which is easier to setup than most of the other methods, and is used by the\n  Eduroam network (bsc#1109209).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
