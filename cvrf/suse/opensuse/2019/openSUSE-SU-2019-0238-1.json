If this happened, the task information,\n    including any private information coul d have been displayed to stdout and\n    (if enabled, not the default) logged to a log file specified in\n    ansible.cfg's log_path.  Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from\n    ansible runs to a log file may have stored that private information onto\n    disk that way as well.  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41414)\n  - Changed the admin_users config option to not include 'admin' by default\n    as admin is frequently used for a non-privileged account\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41164)\n  - Changed the output to 'text' for 'show vrf' command as default 'json'\n    output format with respect to 'eapi' transport was failing\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41470)\n  - Document mode=preserve for both the copy and template module\n  - Fix added for Digital Ocean Volumes API change causing Ansible to\n    recieve an unexpected value in the response. \n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41431)\n  - Fix an encoding issue when parsing the examples from a plugins'\n    documentation\n  - Fix iosxr_config module to handle route-policy, community-set,\n    prefix-set, as-path-set and rd-set blocks.  All these blocks are part of\n    route-policy language of iosxr.\n  - Fix mode=preserve with remote_src=True for the copy module\n  - Implement mode=preserve for the template module\n  - The yaml callback plugin now allows non-ascii characters to be\n    displayed.\n  - Various grafana_* modules - Port away from the deprecated\n    b64encodestring function to the b64encode function instead. \n    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38388\n  - added missing 'raise' to exception definition\n    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41690\n  - allow custom endpoints to be used in the aws_s3 module\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36832)\n  - allow set_options to be called multiple times\n    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41913\n  - ansible-doc - fixed traceback on missing plugins\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41167)\n  - cast the device_mapping volume size to an int in the ec2_ami module\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40938)\n  - copy - fixed copy to only follow symlinks for files in the non-recursive case\n  - copy module - The copy module was attempting to change the mode of files\n    for remote_src=True even if mode was not set as a parameter.  This\n    failed on filesystems which do not have permission bits\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40099)\n  - copy module - fixed recursive copy with relative paths\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40166)\n  - correct debug display for all cases\n    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41331\n  - correctly check hostvars for vars term\n    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41819\n  - correctly handle yaml inventory files when entries are null dicts\n    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41692\n  - dynamic includes - Allow inheriting attributes from static parents\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38827)\n  - dynamic includes - Don't treat undefined vars for conditional includes\n    as truthy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39377)\n  - dynamic includes - Fix IncludedFile comparison for free strategy\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37083)\n  - dynamic includes - Improved performance by fixing re-parenting on copy\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38747)\n  - dynamic includes - Use the copied and merged task for calculating task\n    vars (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39762)\n  - file - fixed the default follow behaviour of file to be true\n  - file module - Eliminate an error if we're asked to remove a file but\n    something removes it while we are processing the request\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39466)\n  - file module - Fix error when recursively assigning permissions and a\n    symlink to a nonexistent file is present in the directory tree\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39456)\n  - file module - Fix error when running a task which assures a symlink to a\n    nonexistent file exists for the second and subsequent times\n    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39558)\n  - file module - The file module allowed the user to specify src as a\n    parameter when state was not link or hard.  This is documented as only\n    applying to state=link or state=hard but in previous Ansible, this could\n    have an effect in rare cornercases.
