      "Description": "JWK Set (JSON Web Key Set) is a JWK and JWK Set Go implementation. Prior to 0.6.0, the project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value).",
