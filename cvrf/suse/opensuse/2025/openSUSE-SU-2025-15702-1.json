In\n__ip_vs_ftp_exit(), skip ip_vs_ftp unregister if called during netns\ncleanup (when exiting_module is false) and defer it to\n__ip_vs_cleanup_batch(), which unregisters all apps after all connections\nare flushed. If called during module exit, unregister ip_vs_ftp\nimmediately.",

Access to this list is intended to be protected by\n'sess-\u003erpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was\nflawed, leading to potential race conditions.\n\nIn ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock\nbefore calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify\nthe XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access\nand prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.\n\nFurthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load()\nwithout holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent\ndata or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and\nthe pointer is dereferenced.\n\nFix these issues by:\n1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()\n   to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring\n   the lock is correctly released on error paths.\n2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()\n   to safely protect the lookup.",

Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer\nto vma-\u003evm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma-\u003evm_flags.\n\nThe inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()\nwith MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,\nit accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of\nvma-\u003evm_flags.\n\nAssuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and\nint are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the \u0026=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the \u0026 operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n\u0026 operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: rust bindgen wasn't able to handle BIT(), from Miguel]",

This validation only\nvalidates the skb-\u003elen (directly reflects size provided at the\nuserspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer\nitself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER).

This leads to the accesses to\nbuffer of `skb_buff-\u003edata` which is not assigned anything yet.\n\nFollowing the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at\n`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective\nhandlers and return error values in case of failure.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuio_hv_generic: Let userspace take care of interrupt mask\n\nRemove the logic to set interrupt mask by default in uio_hv_generic\ndriver as the interrupt mask value is supposed to be controlled\ncompletely by the user space. If the mask bit gets changed\nby the driver, concurrently with user mode operating on the ring,\nthe mask bit may be set when it is supposed to be clear, and the\nuser-mode driver will miss an interrupt which will cause a hang.\n\nFor eg- when the driver sets inbound ring buffer interrupt mask to 1,\nthe host does not interrupt the guest on the UIO VMBus channel.\nHowever, setting the mask does not prevent the host from putting a\nmessage in the inbound ring buffer.  So let's assume that happens,\nthe host puts a message into the ring buffer but does not interrupt.\n\nSubsequently, the user space code in the guest sets the inbound ring\nbuffer interrupt mask to 0, saying \"Hey, I'm ready for interrupts\".\nUser space code then calls pread() to wait for an interrupt.\nThen one of two things happens:\n\n* The host never sends another message. So the pread() waits forever.\n* The host does send another message. But because there's already a\n  message in the ring buffer, it doesn't generate an interrupt.\n  This is the correct behavior, because the host should only send an\n  interrupt when the inbound ring buffer transitions from empty to\n  not-empty. Adding an additional message to a ring buffer that is not\n  empty is not supposed to generate an interrupt on the guest.\n  Since the guest is waiting in pread() and not removing messages from\n  the ring buffer, the pread() waits forever.\n\nThis could be easily reproduced in hv_fcopy_uio_daemon if we delay\nsetting interrupt mask to 0.\n\nSimilarly if hv_uio_channel_cb() sets the interrupt_mask to 1,\nthere's a race condition. Once user space empties the inbound ring\nbuffer, but before user space sets interrupt_mask to 0, the host could\nput another message in the ring buffer but it wouldn't interrupt.\nThen the next pread() would hang.\n\nFix these by removing all instances where interrupt_mask is changed,\nwhile keeping the one in set_event() unchanged to enable userspace\ncontrol the interrupt mask by writing 0/1 to /dev/uioX.",

This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended.",

This typically is done when a transaction\nhandle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as\npart of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation\nif we are low on free space).\n\nSo remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block\ngroup tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this\ncase.\n\nSyzbot reported this with the following stack trace:\n\n  BTRFS info (device loop3 state M): rebuilding free space tree\n  assertion failed: ret == 0 :: 0, in fs/btrfs/free-space-tree.c:1115\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/free-space-tree.c:1115!\n  Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\n  CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6352 Comm: syz.3.25 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\n  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/18/2025\n  RIP: 0010:populate_free_space_tree+0x700/0x710 fs/btrfs/free-space-tree.c:1115\n  Code: ff ff e8 d3 (...)\n  RSP: 0018:ffffc9000430f780 EFLAGS: 00010246\n  RAX: 0000000000000043 RBX: ffff88805b709630 RCX: fea61d0e2e79d000\n  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000080000000 RDI: 0000000000000000\n  RBP: ffffc9000430f8b0 R08: ffffc9000430f4a7 R09: 1ffff92000861e94\n  R10: dffffc0000000000 R11: fffff52000861e95 R12: 0000000000000001\n  R13: 1ffff92000861f00 R14: dffffc0000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n  FS:  00007f424d9fe6c0(0000) GS:ffff888125afc000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 00007fd78ad212c0 CR3: 0000000076d68000 CR4: 00000000003526f0\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   btrfs_rebuild_free_space_tree+0x1ba/0x6d0 fs/btrfs/free-space-tree.c:1364\n   btrfs_start_pre_rw_mount+0x128f/0x1bf0 fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:3062\n   btrfs_remount_rw fs/btrfs/super.c:1334 [inline]\n   btrfs_reconfigure+0xaed/0x2160 fs/btrfs/super.c:1559\n   reconfigure_super+0x227/0x890 fs/super.c:1076\n   do_remount fs/namespace.c:3279 [inline]\n   path_mount+0xd1a/0xfe0 fs/namespace.c:4027\n   do_mount fs/namespace.c:4048 [inline]\n   __do_sys_mount fs/namespace.c:4236 [inline]\n   __se_sys_mount+0x313/0x410 fs/namespace.c:4213\n   do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n   do_syscall_64+0xfa/0xfa0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n   RIP: 0033:0x7f424e39066a\n  Code: d8 64 89 02 (...)\n  RSP: 002b:00007f424d9fde68 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\n  RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007f424d9fdef0 RCX: 00007f424e39066a\n  RDX: 0000200000000180 RSI: 0000200000000380 RDI: 0000000000000000\n  RBP: 0000200000000180 R08: 00007f424d9fdef0 R09: 0000000000000020\n  R10: 0000000000000020 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000200000000380\n  R13: 00007f424d9fdeb0 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 00002000000002c0\n   \u003c/TASK\u003e\n  Modules linked in:\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",

None of the\nrest of the Intel 10G PF/VF drivers supports it. And actually lack of\nsupport was not included in the IPSec implementation - there were no such\ncode paths. No possibility to negotiate support for the feature was\nintroduced along with introduction of the feature itself.\n\nCommit 339f28964147 (\"ixgbevf: Add support for new mailbox communication\nbetween PF and VF\") increasing API version to 1.5 did the same - it\nintroduced code supported specifically by the PF ESX driver. It altered API\nversion for the VF driver in the same time not touching the version\ndefined for the PF ixgbe driver. It led to additional discrepancies,\nas the code provided within API 1.6 cannot be supported for Linux ixgbe\ndriver as it causes crashes.\n\nThe issue was noticed some time ago and mitigated by Jake within the commit\nd0725312adf5 (\"ixgbevf: stop attempting IPSEC offload on Mailbox API 1.5\").\nAs a result we have regression for IPsec support and after increasing API\nto version 1.6 ixgbevf driver stopped to support ESX MBX.\n\nTo fix this mess add new mailbox op asking PF driver about supported\nfeatures. Basing on a response determine whether to set support for IPSec\nand ESX-specific enhanced mailbox.\n\nNew mailbox op, for compatibility purposes, must be added within new API\nrevision, as API version of OOT PF \u0026 VF drivers is already increased to\n1.6 and doesn't incorporate features negotiate op.\n\nFeatures negotiation mechanism gives possibility to be extended with new\nfeatures when needed in the future.",

If such dentry is a directory,\nexportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the\ndentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons\n(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to\nlookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we\nare trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the\nparent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the\nparent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this\ninconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point\nto the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in\ndisconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until\ncommit f1ee616214cb (\"VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon\")\nwhich removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb-\u003es_anon list.\nThus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely\nrelies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.\nHowever when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the\nscenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries\nare \"leaked\". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise\nthey stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous \"Busy\ninodes after unmount\" bug.
