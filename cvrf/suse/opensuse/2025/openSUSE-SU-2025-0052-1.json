      "Text": "This update for python-asteval fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to 1.0.6:\n\n  * drop testing and support for Python3.8, add Python 3.13,\n    change document to reflect this.\n  * implement safe_getattr and safe_format functions; fix bugs\n    in UNSAFE_ATTRS and UNSAFE_ATTRS_DTYPES usage (boo#1236405,\n    CVE-2025-24359)\n  * make all procedure attributes private to curb access to AST\n    nodes, which can be exploited\n  * improvements to error messages, including use ast functions\n    to construct better error messages\n  * remove import of numpy.linalg, as documented\n  * update doc description for security advisory\n\nUpdate to 1.0.5:\n\n  * more work on handling errors, including fixing #133 and\n    adding more comprehensive tests for #129 and #132\n\nUpdate to 1.0.4:\n\n  * fix error handling that might result in null exception\n\nUpdate to 1.0.3:\n\n  * functions ('Procedures') defined within asteval have a `\n    _signature()` method, now use in repr\n  * add support for deleting subscript\n  * nested symbol tables now have a  Group() function\n  * update coverage config\n  * cleanups of exception handling :  errors must now have an\n    exception\n  * several related fixes to suppress repeated exceptions: see GH\n    #132 and #129\n  * make non-boolean return values from comparison operators\n    behave like Python - not immediately testing as bool\n\n- update to 1.0.2:\n  * fix NameError handling in expression code\n  * make exception messages more Python-like\n- update to 1.0.1:\n  * security fixes, based on audit by Andrew Effenhauser, Ayman\n    Hammad, and Daniel Crowley, IBM X-Force Security Research\n    division\n  * remove numpy modules polynomial, fft, linalg by default for\n    security concerns\n  * disallow string.format(), improve security of f-string\n    evaluation\n\n- update to 1.0.0:\n  * fix (again) nested list comprehension (Issues #127 and #126).\n  * add more testing of multiple list comprehensions.\n  * more complete support for Numpy 2, and removal of many Numpy\n    symbols that have been long deprecated.\n  * remove AST nodes deprecated in Python 3.8.\n  * clean up build files and outdated tests.\n  * fixes to codecov configuration.\n  * update docs.\n\n- update to 0.9.33:\n  * fixes for multiple list comprehensions (addressing #126)\n  * add testing with optionally installed numpy_financial to CI\n  * test existence of all numpy imports to better safeguard\n    against missing functions (for safer numpy 2 transition)\n  * update rendered doc to include PDF and zipped HTML\n\n- update to 0.9.32:\n  * add deprecations message for numpy functions to be removed in\n    numpy 2.0\n  * comparison operations use try/except for short-circuiting\n    instead of checking for numpy arrays (addressing #123)\n  * add Python 3.12 to testing\n  * move repository from 'newville' to 'lmfit' organization\n  * update doc theme, GitHub locations pointed to by docs, other\n    doc tweaks.\n\n- Update to 0.9.31:\n  * cleanup numpy imports to avoid deprecated functions, add financial\n  functions from numpy_financial module, if installed.\n  * prefer 'user_symbols' when initializing Interpreter, but still support\n  'usersyms' argument. Will deprecate and remove eventually.\n  * add support of optional (off-by default) 'nested symbol table'.\n  * update tests to run most tests with symbol tables of dict and nested\n  group type.\n  * general code and testing cleanup.\n  * add config argument to Interpreter to more fully control which nodes are supported\n  * add support for import and importfrom -- off by default\n  * add support for with blocks\n  * add support for f-strings\n  * add support of set and dict comprehension\n  * fix bug with 'int**int' not returning a float.\n\n- update to 0.9.29:\n  * bug fixes\n\n- Update to 0.9.28\n  * add support for Python 3.11\n  * add support for multiple list comprehensions\n  * improve performance of making the initial symbol table,\n    and Interpreter creation, including better checking for index_tricks attributes\n\n- update to 0.9.27:\n  * more cleanups\n\n- update to 0.9.26:\n  * fix setup.py again\n\n- update to 0.9.25:\n  * fixes import errors for Py3.6 and 3.7, setting version with\n    importlib_metadata.version if available.\n  * use setuptools_scm and importlib for version\n  * treat all __dunder__ attributes of all objects as inherently unsafe.\n\n- Update to 0.9.22\n  * another important but small fix for Python 3.9\n  * Merge branch 'nested_interrupts_returns'\n- Drop hard numpy requirement, don't test on python36\n\n- update to 0.9.18\n  * drop python2\n  * few fixes\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2025-24359",
      "Description": "ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.",
