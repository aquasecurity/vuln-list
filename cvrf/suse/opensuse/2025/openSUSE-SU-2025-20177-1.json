The recommended Go toolchain\n    dependency expression is BuildRequires: golang(API) \u003e= 1.x or\n    optionally the metapackage BuildRequires: go\n  * Use BuildRequires: golang(API) \u003e= 1.19 matching go.mod\n  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:\n    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS=\"-buildmode=pie\" %%endif go build\n    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable\n    but none exist at this time.\n  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable\n  * Remove go build -o output binary location and name. Default\n    binary has the same name as package of func main() and is\n    placed in the top level of the build directory.\n  * Add basic %check to execute binary --help\n\n- Packaging improvements:\n  * Service go_modules replace dependencies with CVEs\n  * Replace github.com/cloudflare/circl=github.com/cloudflare/circl@v1.6.1\n    Fix GO-2025-3754 GHSA-2x5j-vhc8-9cwm\n  * Replace golang.org/x/net=golang.org/x/net@v0.36.0\n    Fixes GO-2025-3503 CVE-2025-22870\n  * Replace golang.org/x/crypto=golang.org/x/crypto@v0.35.0\n    Fixes GO-2023-2402 CVE-2023-48795 GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8\n    Fixes GO-2025-3487 CVE-2025-22869\n  * Replace github.com/go-git/go-git/v5=github.com/go-git/go-git/v5@v5.13.0\n    Fixes GO-2025-3367 CVE-2025-21614 GHSA-r9px-m959-cxf4\n    Fixes GO-2025-3368 CVE-2025-21613 GHSA-v725-9546-7q7m\n  * Service tar_scm set mode manual from disabled\n  * Service tar_scm create archive from git so we can exclude\n    vendor directory upstream committed to git. Committed vendor\n    directory contents have build issues even after go mod tidy.\n  * Service tar_scm exclude dir vendor\n  * Service set_version set mode manual from disabled\n  * Service set_version remove param basename not needed\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2023-48795",
      "Description": "The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.
