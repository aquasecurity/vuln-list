      "Description": "An access control vulnerability was discovered in Grafana OSS where an Organization administrator could permanently delete the Server administrator account. This vulnerability exists in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited when:\n\n1. An Organization administrator exists\n\n2. The Server administrator is either:\n\n   - Not part of any organization, or\n   - Part of the same organization as the Organization administrator\nImpact:\n\n- Organization administrators can permanently delete Server administrator accounts\n\n- If the only Server administrator is deleted, the Grafana instance becomes unmanageable\n\n- No super-user permissions remain in the system\n\n- Affects all users, organizations, and teams managed in the instance\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly serious as it can lead to a complete loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance.",

      "Description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused by combining a client path traversal and open redirect. This allows attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve a full read SSRF.\n\nThe default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the XSS though the `connect-src` directive.",
