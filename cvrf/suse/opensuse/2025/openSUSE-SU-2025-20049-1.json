      "Text": "This update for tiff fixes the following issues:\n\ntiff was updated to 4.7.1:\n\n* Software configuration changes:\n\n  * Define HAVE_JPEGTURBO_DUAL_MODE_8_12 and LERC_STATIC in tif_config.h.\n  * CMake: define WORDS_BIGENDIAN via tif_config.h\n  * doc/CMakeLists.txt: remove useless cmake_minimum_required()\n  * CMake: fix build with LLVM/Clang 17 (fixes issue #651)\n  * CMake: set CMP0074 new policy\n  * Set LINKER_LANGUAGE for C targets with C deps\n  * Export tiffxx cmake target (fixes issue #674)\n  * autogen.sh: Enable verbose wget.\n  * configure.ac: Syntax updates for Autoconf 2.71\n  * autogen.sh: Re-implement based on autoreconf. Failure to update\n    config.guess/config.sub does not return error (fixes issue #672)\n  * CMake: fix CMake 4.0 warning when minimum required version is \u003c 3.10.\n  * CMake: Add build option tiff-static (fixes issue #709)\n  Library changes:\n  * Add TIFFOpenOptionsSetWarnAboutUnknownTags() for explicit control\n    about emitting warnings for unknown tags. No longer emit warnings\n    about unknown tags by default\n  * tif_predict.c: speed-up decompression in some cases.\n\n* Bug fixes:\n\n  * tif_fax3: For fax group 3 data if no EOL is detected, reading is\n    retried without synchronisation for EOLs. (fixes issue #54)\n  * Updating TIFFMergeFieldInfo() with read_count=write_count=0 for\n    FIELD_IGNORE. Updating TIFFMergeFieldInfo() with read_count=write_count=0 for\n    FIELD_IGNORE. Improving handling when field_name = NULL. (fixes issue #532)\n  * tiff.h: add COMPRESSION_JXL_DNG_1_7=52546 as used for JPEGXL compression in\n    the DNG 1.7 specification\n  * TIFFWriteDirectorySec: Increment string length for ASCII tags for codec tags\n    defined with FIELD_xxx bits, as it is done for FIELD_CUSTOM tags. (fixes issue #648)\n  * Do not error out on a tag whose tag count value is zero, just issue a warning.\n    Fix parsing a private tag 0x80a6 (fixes issue #647)\n  * TIFFDefaultTransferFunction(): give up beyond td_bitspersample = 24\n    Fixes https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/10875)\n  * tif_getimage.c: Remove unnecessary calls to TIFFRGBAImageOK() (fixes issue #175)\n  * Fix writing a Predictor=3 file with non-native endianness\n  * _TIFFVSetField(): fix potential use of unallocated memory (out-of-bounds\n  * read / nullptr dereference) in case of out-of-memory situation when dealing with\n    custom tags (fixes issue #663)\n  * tif_fax3.c: Error out for CCITT fax encoding if SamplesPerPixel is not equal 1 and\n    PlanarConfiguration = Contiguous (fixes issue #26)\n  * tif_fax3.c: error out after a number of times end-of-line or unexpected bad code\n    words have been reached. (fixes issue #670)\n  * Fix memory leak in TIFFSetupStrips() (fixes issue #665)\n  * tif_zip.c: Provide zlib allocation functions. Otherwise for zlib built with\n    -DZ_SOLO inflating will fail.\n  * Fix memory leak in _TIFFSetDefaultCompressionState. (fixes issue #676)\n  * tif_predict.c: Don’t overwrite input buffer of TIFFWriteScanline() if \"prediction\"\n    is enabled. Use extra working buffer in PredictorEncodeRow(). (fixes issue #5)\n  * tif_getimage.c: update some integer overflow checks (fixes issue #79)\n  * tif_getimage.c: Fix buffer underflow crash for less raster rows at\n    TIFFReadRGBAImageOriented() (fixes issue #704, bsc#1250413, CVE-2025-9900)\n  * TIFFReadRGBAImage(): several fixes to avoid buffer overflows.\n  * Correct passing arguments to TIFFCvtIEEEFloatToNative() and TIFFCvtIEEEDoubleToNative()\n    if HAVE_IEEEFP is not defined. (fixes issue #699)\n  * LZWDecode(): avoid nullptr dereference when trying to read again after EOI marker\n    has been found with remaining output bytes (fixes issue #698)\n  * TIFFSetSubDirectory(): check _TIFFCheckDirNumberAndOffset() return.\n  * TIFFUnlinkDirectory() and TIFFWriteDirectorySec(): clear tif_rawcp when clearing\n    tif_rawdata (fixes issue #711)\n  * JPEGEncodeRaw(): error out if a previous scanline failed to be written, to avoid\n    out-of-bounds access (fixes issue #714)\n  * tif_jpeg: Fix bug in JPEGDecodeRaw() if JPEG_LIB_MK1_OR_12BIT is defined for 8/12bit\n    dual mode, introduced in libjpeg-turbo 2.2, which was actually released as 3.0.\n    Fixes issue #717\n  * add assert for TIFFReadCustomDirectory infoarray check.\n  * ppm2tiff: Fix bug in pack_words trailing bytes, where last two bytes of each line\n    were written wrongly. (fixes issue #467)\n  * fax2ps: fix regression of commit 28c38d648b64a66c3218778c4745225fe3e3a06d where\n    TIFFTAG_FAXFILLFUNC is being used rather than an output buffer (fixes issue #649)\n  * tiff2pdf: Check TIFFTAG_TILELENGTH and TIFFTAGTILEWIDTH (fixes issue #650)\n  * tiff2pdf: check h_samp and v_samp for range 1 to 4 to avoid division by zero.\n    Fixes issue #654\n  * tiff2pdf: avoid null pointer dereference.

      "Description": "A flaw has been found in LibTIFF 4.7.0. This affects the function _TIFFmallocExt/_TIFFCheckRealloc/TIFFHashSetNew/InitCCITTFax3 of the file tools/tiffcmp.c of the component tiffcmp. Executing manipulation can lead to memory leak. The attack is restricted to local execution. This attack is characterized by high complexity. It is indicated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit has been published and may be used. There is ongoing doubt regarding the real existence of this vulnerability. This patch is called ed141286a37f6e5ddafb5069347ff5d587e7a4e0. It is best practice to apply a patch to resolve this issue. A researcher disputes the security impact of this issue, because \"this is a memory leak on a command line tool that is about to exit anyway\". In the reply the project maintainer declares this issue as \"a simple 'bug' when leaving the command line tool and (...) not a security issue at all\".",

      "Description": "A flaw was found in Libtiff. This vulnerability is a \"write-what-where\" condition, triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF image file.\n\nBy providing an abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata, an attacker can trick the library into writing attacker-controlled color data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user.",
