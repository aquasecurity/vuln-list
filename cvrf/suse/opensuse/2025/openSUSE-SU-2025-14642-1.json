The root cause is that if `len` read in `start_decoder` is a negative number and `setup_malloc` successfully allocates memory in that case, but memory write is done with a negative index `len`. Similarly if len is INT_MAX the integer overflow len+1 happens in `f-\u003evendor = (char*)setup_malloc(f, sizeof(char) * (len+1));` and `f-\u003ecomment_list[i] = (char*)setup_malloc(f, sizeof(char) * (len+1));`.

The root cause is a potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) * (f-\u003ecomment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc` allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.",
