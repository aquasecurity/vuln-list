Enabling or disabling a static branch in Linux\nuses the kernel's \"text poke\" code patching mechanism.  To modify code\nwhile other CPUs may be executing that code, Linux (temporarily)\nreplaces the first byte of the original instruction with an int3 (opcode\n0xcc), then patches in the new code stream except for the first byte,\nand finally replaces the int3 with the first byte of the new code\nstream.  If a CPU hits the int3, i.e. executes the code while it's being\nmodified, then the guest kernel must look up the RIP to determine how to\nhandle the #BP, e.g. by emulating the new instruction.  If the RIP is\nincorrect, then this lookup fails and the guest kernel panics.\n\nThe bug reproduces almost instantly by hacking the guest kernel to\nrepeatedly check a static branch[1] while running a drgn script[2] on\nthe host to constantly swap out the memory containing the guest's TSS.\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/44d17c51c28c0ac998ea0334edf90b5a\n[2]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/10e45e45afa29b11e0c7209247afc00b",

If the node is present in the list that `remove` is\ncalled on, then that is fine because we have exclusive access to that\nlist. If the node is not in any list, then it's also ok. But if it's\npresent in a different list that may be accessed in parallel, then that\nmay be a data race on the prev/next pointers.\n\nAnd unfortunately that is exactly what is happening here. In\nNode::release, we:\n\n 1. Take the lock.\n 2. Move all items to a local list on the stack.\n 3. Drop the lock.\n 4. Iterate the local list on the stack.\n\nCombined with threads using the unsafe remove method on the original\nlist, this leads to memory corruption of the prev/next pointers.

This creates\nuse-after-free scenarios where the ucsi and gaokun_ucsi structure\nare freed after ucsi_destroy() completes execution, while the\ngaokun_ucsi_register_worker() might be either currently executing\nor still pending in the work queue. The already-freed gaokun_ucsi\nor ucsi structure may then be accessed.\n\nFurthermore, the race window is 3 seconds, which is sufficiently\nlong to make this bug easily reproducible.

      "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop\n\nIn cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen\nand backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes\nthat the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this\nassumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent\nqdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog\naccounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference\n(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).\n\nThis patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by\nobserving the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()\ncalls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()\nreturns NET_XMIT_CN.\n\nTo ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new\nvariable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.",
