      "Text": "This update for mupdf to version 1.10a fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed: \n\n- CVE-2016-10132: Null pointer dereference in regexp because of a missing check after allocating memory allowing for DoS (bsc#1019877).\n- CVE-2016-10133: Heap buffer overflow write in js_stackoverflow allowing for DoS or possible code execution (bsc#1019877).\n- CVE-2016-10141: An integer overflow vulnerability triggered by a regular expression with nested repetition. A successful exploitation of this issue can lead to code execution or a denial of service (buffer overflow) condition (bsc#1019877).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed: \n\n- A bug with mutool and saving PDF files using the 'ascii' option has been fixed.\n- Stop defining OPJ_STATIC\n- FictionBook (FB2) e-book support.\n-  Simple SVG parser (a small subset of SVG only).\n-  mutool convert: a new document conversion tool and interface.\n-  Multi-threaded rendering in mudraw.\n-  Updated base 14 fonts from URW.\n-  New CJK font with language specific variants.\n-  Hyperlink support in EPUB.\n-  Alpha channel is now optional in pixmaps.\n-  More aggressive purging of cached objects.\n-  Partial image decoding for lower memory use when banding.\n-  Reduced default set of built-in CMap tables to the minimum required.\n-  FZ_ENABLE_PDF, _XPS, _JS, to disable features at compile time.\n-  Function level linking.\n-  Dropped pdf object generation numbers from public interfaces.\n-  Simplified PDF page, xobject, and annotation internals.\n-  Closing and freeing devices and writers are now separate steps.\n-  Improved PDF annotation editing interface (still a work in progress).\n-  Document writer interface.\n-  Banded image writer interface.\n-  Bidirectional layout for Arabic and Hebrew scripts.\n-  Shaping complex scripts for EPUB text layout.\n-  Noto fallback fonts for EPUB layout.\n-  mutool create:\n   - Create new PDF files from scratch.\n   - Read an annotated content stream in a text file and write a\n     PDF file, automatically embedding font and image resources.\n-  mutool run:\n   + Run javascript scripts with MuPDF bindings.\n   + The interface is similar to the new Java interface.\n-  mutool draw:\n   + Optional multi-threaded operation (Windows and pthreads).\n   + Optional low memory mode (primarily for testing).\n- Set to best anti-alias mode (8) by default. \n- Ship mupdf-x11-curl as default mupdf. Drop non-curl version.\n- New URW fonts with greek and cyrillic.\n- 64-bit file support.\n- Updated FreeType to version 2.6.1.\n- Various font substitution bug fixes.\n- EPUB improvements: User style sheets, GIF images, Table of Contents,\n  CJK text, Page margins and many bug fixes.",
