      "Text": "This update for tiff to version 4.0.8 fixes a several bugs and security issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-7595: The JPEGSetupEncode function allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted image (bsc#1033127).\n- CVE-2016-10371: The TIFFWriteDirectoryTagCheckedRational function allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted TIFF file (bsc#1038438).\n- CVE-2017-7598: Error in tif_dirread.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted image (bsc#1033118).\n- CVE-2017-7596: Undefined behavior because of floats outside their expected value range, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033126).\n- CVE-2017-7597: Undefined behavior because of floats outside their expected value range, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033120).\n- CVE-2017-7599: Undefined behavior because of shorts outside their expected value range, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033113).\n- CVE-2017-7600: Undefined behavior because of chars outside their expected value range, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033112).\n- CVE-2017-7601: Because of a shift exponent too large for 64-bit type long undefined behavior was caused, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033111).\n- CVE-2017-7602: Prevent signed integer overflow, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033109).\n- CVE-2017-7592: The putagreytile function had a left-shift undefined behavior issue, which might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image (bsc#1033131).\n- CVE-2017-7593: Ensure that tif_rawdata is properly initialized, to prevent remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted image (bsc#1033129).\n- CVE-2017-7594: The OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesDcTable function allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted image (bsc#1033128).\n- CVE-2017-9403: Prevent memory leak in function TIFFReadDirEntryLong8Array, which allowed attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file (bsc#1042805).\n- CVE-2017-9404: Fixed memory leak vulnerability in function OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable, which allowed attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file (bsc#1042804).\n\nThese various other issues were fixed:\n\n- Fix uint32 overflow in TIFFReadEncodedStrip() that caused an\n  integer division by zero. Reported by Agostino Sarubbo.\n- fix heap-based buffer overflow on generation of PixarLog / LUV\n  compressed files, with ColorMap, TransferFunction attached and\n  nasty plays with bitspersample. The fix for LUV has not been\n  tested, but suffers from the same kind of issue of PixarLog.\n- modify ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip() to instanciate compute\n  ntrips as TIFFhowmany_32(td-\u003etd_imagelength, rowsperstrip),\n  instead of a logic based on the total size of data. Which is\n  faulty is the total size of data is not sufficient to fill the\n  whole image, and thus results in reading outside of the\n  StripByCounts/StripOffsets arrays when using\n  TIFFReadScanline()\n- make OJPEGDecode() early exit in case of failure in\n  OJPEGPreDecode(). This will avoid a divide by zero, and\n  potential other issues.\n- fix misleading indentation as warned by GCC.\n- revert change done on 2016-01-09 that made Param member of\n  TIFFFaxTabEnt structure a uint16 to reduce size of the\n  binary. It happens that the Hylafax software uses the tables\n  that follow this typedef (TIFFFaxMainTable, TIFFFaxWhiteTable,\n  TIFFFaxBlackTable), although they are not in a public libtiff\n  header.\n- add TIFFReadRGBAStripExt() and TIFFReadRGBATileExt() variants\n  of the functions without ext, with an extra argument to control\n  the stop_on_error behaviour.\n- fix potential memory leaks in error code path of\n  TIFFRGBAImageBegin().\n- increase libjpeg max memory usable to 10 MB instead of libjpeg\n  1MB default. This helps when creating files with 'big' tile,\n  without using libjpeg temporary files.\n- add _TIFFcalloc()\n- return 0 in Encode functions instead of -1 when\n  TIFFFlushData1() fails.\n- only run JPEGFixupTagsSubsampling() if the YCbCrSubsampling\n  tag is not explicitly present. This helps a bit to reduce the\n  I/O amount when the tag is present (especially on cloud hosted\n  files).\n- in LZWPostEncode(), increase, if necessary, the code bit-width\n  after flushing the remaining code and before emitting the EOI\n  code.\n- fix memory leak in error code path of PixarLogSetupDecode().\n- fix potential memory leak in\n  OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable,\n  OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesDcTable and\n  OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesAcTable\n- avoid crash in Fax3Close() on empty file.\n- TIFFFillStrip(): add limitation to the number of bytes read\n  in case td_stripbytecount[strip] is bigger than reasonable,\n  so as to avoid excessive memory allocation.\n- fix memory leak when the underlying codec (ZIP, PixarLog)\n  succeeds its setupdecode() method, but PredictorSetup fails.\n- TIFFFillStrip() and TIFFFillTile(): avoid excessive memory\n  allocation in case of shorten files. Only effective on 64 bit\n  builds and non-mapped cases.\n- TIFFFillStripPartial() / TIFFSeek(), avoid potential integer\n  overflows with read_ahead in CHUNKY_STRIP_READ_SUPPORT mode.\n- avoid excessive memory allocation in case of shorten files.\n  Only effective on 64 bit builds.\n- update tif_rawcc in CHUNKY_STRIP_READ_SUPPORT mode with\n  tif_rawdataloaded when calling TIFFStartStrip() or\n  TIFFFillStripPartial(). \n- avoid potential int32 overflow in TIFFYCbCrToRGBInit() Fixes\n- avoid potential int32 overflows in multiply_ms() and add_ms().\n- fix out-of-buffer read in PackBitsDecode() Fixes\n- LogL16InitState(): avoid excessive memory allocation when\n  RowsPerStrip tag is missing.\n- update dec_bitsleft at beginning of LZWDecode(), and update\n  tif_rawcc at end of LZWDecode(). This is needed to properly\n  work with the latest chnges in tif_read.c in\n  CHUNKY_STRIP_READ_SUPPORT mode.\n- PixarLogDecode(): resync tif_rawcp with next_in and tif_rawcc\n  with avail_in at beginning and end of function, similarly to\n  what is done in LZWDecode(). Likely needed so that it works\n  properly with latest chnges in tif_read.c in\n  CHUNKY_STRIP_READ_SUPPORT mode.\n- initYCbCrConversion(): add basic validation of luma and\n  refBlackWhite coefficients (just check they are not NaN for\n  now), to avoid potential float to int overflows.\n- _TIFFVSetField(): fix outside range cast of double to float.\n- initYCbCrConversion(): check luma[1] is not zero to avoid division by zero\n- _TIFFVSetField(): fix outside range cast of double to float.\n- initYCbCrConversion(): check luma[1] is not zero to avoid\n  division by zero.\n- initYCbCrConversion(): stricter validation for refBlackWhite\n  coefficients values.\n- avoid uint32 underflow in cpDecodedStrips that can cause\n  various issues, such as buffer overflows in the library.\n- fix readContigStripsIntoBuffer() in -i (ignore) mode so that\n  the output buffer is correctly incremented to avoid write\n  outside bounds.\n- add 3 extra bytes at end of strip buffer in\n  readSeparateStripsIntoBuffer() to avoid read outside of heap\n  allocated buffer.\n- fix integer division by zero when BitsPerSample is missing.\n- fix null pointer dereference in -r mode when the image has no\n  StripByteCount tag.\n- avoid potential division by zero is BitsPerSamples tag is\n  missing.\n- when TIFFGetField(, TIFFTAG_NUMBEROFINKS, ) is called, limit\n  the return number of inks to SamplesPerPixel, so that code\n  that parses ink names doesn't go past the end of the buffer.\n- avoid potential division by zero is BitsPerSamples tag is\n  missing.\n- fix uint32 underflow/overflow that can cause heap-based buffer\n  overflow.\n- replace assert( (bps % 8) == 0 ) by a non assert check.\n- fix 2 heap-based buffer overflows (in PSDataBW and\n  PSDataColorContig).\n- prevent heap-based buffer overflow in -j mode on a paletted\n  image.\n- fix wrong usage of memcpy() that can trigger unspecified behaviour.\n- avoid potential invalid memory read in t2p_writeproc.\n- avoid potential heap-based overflow in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile().\n- remove extraneous TIFFClose() in error code path, that caused\n  double free.\n- error out cleanly in cpContig2SeparateByRow and\n  cpSeparate2ContigByRow if BitsPerSample != 8 to avoid heap\n  based overflow.\n- avoid integer division by zero.\n- call TIFFClose() in error code paths.\n- emit appropriate message if the input file is empty.\n- close TIFF handle in error code path.\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
