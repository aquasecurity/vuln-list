It has been unusable and\n    dormant for some time.\n  - Remove the Mxit protocol plugin. The service was closed at\n    the end ofSeptember 2016.\n  - Remove the MySpaceIM protocol plugin.

Yahoo has completely\n    reimplemented their protocol, so this version is no longer\n    operable as of August 5th, 2016.\n  - Remove the Facebook (XMPP) account option. According to\n    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat the XMPP Chat API\n    service ended April 30th, 2015.\n  - Fix gnutls certificate validation errors that mainly\n    affected Google.\n+ General:\n  - Replace instances of d.pidgin.im with developer.pidgin.im and\n    update the urls to use https (pidgin.im#17036).\n+ IRC:\n  - Fix an issue of messages being silently cut off at 500\n    characters. Large messages are now split into parts and sent\n    one by one (pidgin.im#4753).\n",
