      "Text": "This update for dovecot22 to version 2.2.30.2 fixes the following issues:\n\nThis security issue was fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-2669: Don't double-expand %variables in keys. If dict was used as the authentication passdb, using specially crafted %variables in the username could be used to cause DoS (bsc#1032248)\n\nAdditionally stronger SSL default ciphers are now used.\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n\n- Remove all references /etc/ssl/certs/. It should not be used anymore (bsc#932386)\n\nThe version 2.2.30.2 also includes many fixes and enhancements:\n\n- Multiple failed authentications within short time caused crashes.\n- Use timing safe comparisons for everything related to passwords.\n- Master process now sends SIGQUIT to all running children at shutdown, which instructs\n  them to close all the socket listeners immediately. Restarting Dovecot should no longer\n  fail due to some processes keeping the listeners open for a long time.\n- Add passdb { mechanisms=none } to match separate passdb lookup.\n- Add passdb { username_filter } to use passdb only if user matches the filter.\n- Add dsync_commit_msgs_interval setting. It attempts to commit the transaction after\n  saving this many new messages.\n- Support imapc_features=search without ESEARCH extension.\n- Add imapc_features=fetch-bodystructure to pass through remote server's FETCH BODY and\n  BODYSTRUCTURE.\n- Add quota=imapc backend to use GETQUOTA/GETQUOTAROOT on the remote server.\n- Add allow_invalid_cert and ssl_ca_file parameters.\n- If dovecot.index.cache corruption is detected, reset only the one corrupted mail instead\n  of the whole file.\n- Add 'firstsaved' field to doveadm mailbox status.\n- Add old host's up/down and vhost count as parameters to director_flush_socket.\n- More fixes to automatically fix corruption in dovecot.list.index.\n- Fix support for dsync_features=empty-header-workaround.\n- IMAP NOTIFY wasn't working for non-INBOX if IMAP client hadn't enabled modseq tracking\n  via CONDSTORE/QRESYNC.\n- Fix fts-lucene it to work again with mbox format.\n- Some internal error messages may have contained garbage in v2.2.29.\n- Re-encrypt when copying/moving mails and per-mailbox keys are used, otherwise the copied\n  mails can't be opened.\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",

When 'dict' passdb and userdb were used for user authentication, the username sent by the IMAP/POP3 client was sent through var_expand() to perform %variable expansion. Sending specially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory usage causing the process to crash (and restart), or excessive CPU usage causing all authentications to hang.",
