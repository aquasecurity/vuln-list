(bsc#913650)\n- CVE-2014-9620: The ELF parser in file allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of notes. (bsc#913651)\n- CVE-2014-9653: readelf.c in file did not consider that pread calls sometimes read only a subset of the available data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file. (bsc#917152)\n- CVE-2014-8116: The ELF parser (readelf.c) in file allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash) via a large number of (1) program or (2) section headers or (3) invalid capabilities. (bsc#910253)\n- CVE-2014-8117: softmagic.c in file did not properly limit recursion, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash) via unspecified vectors. (bsc#910253)\n\nVersion update to file version 5.22\n\n* add indirect relative for TIFF/Exif\n* restructure elf note printing to avoid repeated messages\n* add note limit, suggested by Alexander Cherepanov\n* Bail out on partial pread()'s (Alexander Cherepanov)\n* Fix incorrect bounds check in file_printable (Alexander Cherepanov)\n* PR/405: ignore SIGPIPE from uncompress programs\n* change printable -\u003e file_printable and use it in more places for safety\n* in ELF, instead of '(uses dynamic libraries)' when PT_INTERP is present print the interpreter name.\n\nVersion update to file version 5.21\n\n* there was an incorrect free in magic_load_buffers()\n* there was an out of bounds read for some pascal strings\n* there was a memory leak in magic lists\n* don't interpret strings printed from files using the current\n  locale, convert them to ascii format first.\n* there was an out of bounds read in elf note reads\n\nUpdate to file version 5.20\n\n* recognize encrypted CDF documents\n* add magic_load_buffers from Brooks Davis\n* add thumbs.db support\n\nAdditional non-security bug fixes:\n\n* Fixed a memory corruption during rpmbuild (bsc#1063269)\n* Backport of a fix for an increased printable string length as found in file 5.30 (bsc#996511)\n* file command throws 'Composite Document File V2 Document, corrupt: Can't read SSAT' error against excel 97/2003 file format. (bsc#1009966)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
