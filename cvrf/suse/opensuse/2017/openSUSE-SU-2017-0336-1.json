      "Text": "\n\t\t\t\t    This update for lcms2 to version 2.8 fixes the following issues:\n\n\t\t\t\t    This security issue was fixed:\n\n\t\t\t\t    - Fixed an out-of-bounds heap read in Type_MLU_Read that could be triggered by an untrusted image with a crafted ICC profile (boo#1021364).\n\n\t\t\t\t    These non-security issues were fixed:\n\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed many typos in comments, thanks to Stefan Weil for doing that.\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed localization bug, added a new test case crayons.icc thnaks to Richard Hughes for providing the profile.\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed a bug in optimizer that made some formats (i.e, bits planar) unavailable\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed misalignment problems on Alpha. The compiler does not align strings, and accessing begin of string as a uint16 makes code to fail.\n\t\t\t\t    * Added some extra checks to the tools and examples.\n\t\t\t\t    * Fix a bug that prevented to read luminance tag\n\t\t\t\t    * BIG amount of functionality contributed/Sponsored by Alien Skin Software: TransformStride, copyAlpha, performance plug-ins. Fixes some warnings as well.\n\t\t\t\t    * added an extra _ to _stdcall to make it more portable\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed a bug in transicc for named color profiles\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed several compiler warnings\n\t\t\t\t    * Added support for Visual Studio 2015\n\t\t\t\t    * Fixed for XCODE project\n\t\t\t\t    * Update to GNOME 3.20\n\t\t\t    ",
