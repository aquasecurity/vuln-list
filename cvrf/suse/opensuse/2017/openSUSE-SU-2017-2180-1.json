      "Text": "This update for libheimdal fixes the following issues:\n\n    - Fix CVE-2017-11103: Orpheus' Lyre KDC-REP service name\n      validation.\n      This is a critical vulnerability.\n      In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be\n      obtained from encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead\n      of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'.\n      Use of the unecrypted version provides an opportunity for\n      successful server impersonation and other attacks.\n      Identified by Jeffrey Altman, Viktor Duchovni and\n      Nico Williams.\n      See https://www.orpheus-lyre.info/ for more details. (bsc#1048278)\n\n    - Fix CVE-2017-6594: transit path validation inadvertently \n      caused the previous hop realm to not be added\n      to the transit path of issued tickets. This may, in some\n      cases, enable bypass of capath policy in Heimdal versions 1.5\n      through 7.2.\n      Note, this may break sites that rely on the bug. With the bug\n      some incomplete [capaths] worked, that should not have.\n      These may now break authentication in some cross-realm\n      configurations.\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2017-11103",
      "Description": "Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.",
