      "Text": "This update for tor fixes the following issues:\n\n- tor 0.4.8.8:\n\n  * Mitigate an issue when Tor compiled with OpenSSL can crash during\n    handshake with a remote relay. (TROVE-2023-004, boo#1216873)\n  * Regenerate fallback directories generated on November 03, 2023.\n  * Update the geoip files to match the IPFire Location Database, as\n    retrieved on 2023/11/03\n  * directory authority: Look at the network parameter\n    'maxunmeasuredbw' with the correct spelling\n  * vanguards addon support: Count the conflux linked cell as\n    valid when it is successfully processed. This will quiet a \n    spurious warn in the vanguards addon\n\n- tor 0.4.8.7:\n\n  * Fix an issue that prevented us from pre-building more conflux\n    sets after existing sets had been used\n\n- tor 0.4.8.6:\n\n  * onion service: Fix a reliability issue where services were\n    expiring their introduction points every consensus update.\n    This caused connectivity issues for clients caching the old\n    descriptor and intro points\n  * Log the input and output buffer sizes when we detect a potential\n    compression bomb\n  * Disable multiple BUG warnings of a missing relay identity key when\n    starting an instance of Tor compiled without relay support\n  * When reporting a pseudo-networkstatus as a bridge authority, or\n    answering 'ns/purpose/*' controller requests, include accurate\n    published-on dates from our list of router descriptors\n  * Use less frightening language and lower the log-level of our\n    run-time ABI compatibility check message in our Zstd\n    compression subsystem\n\n- tor 0.4.8.5:\n\n  * bugfixes creating log BUG stacktrace\n\n- tor 0.4.8.4:\n\n  * Extend DoS protection to partially opened channels and known\n    relays\n  * Dynamic Proof-Of-Work protocol to thwart flooding DoS attacks\n    against hidden services. Disabled by default, enable via\n    'HiddenServicePoW' in torrc\n  * Implement conflux traffic splitting\n  * Directory authorities and relays now interact properly with\n    directory authorities if they change addresses\n\n- tor 0.4.7.14:\n\n  *  bugfix affecting vanguards (onion service), and minor fixes\n  \n- Enable support for scrypt()\n",
