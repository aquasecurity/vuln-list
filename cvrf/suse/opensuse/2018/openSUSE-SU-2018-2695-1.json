      "Text": "This update for compat-openssl098 fixes the following security issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-0732: During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based\n  ciphersuite a malicious server could have sent a very large prime value to the\n  client. This caused the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time\n  generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has\n  finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack (bsc#1097158)\n- Blinding enhancements for ECDSA and DSA (bsc#1097624, bsc#1098592)\n- CVE-2018-0737: The RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be\n  vulnerable to a cache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient\n  access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process\n  could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)\n- CVE-2018-0739: Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as\n  can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input\n  with excessive recursion. This could have resulted in DoS (bsc#1087102).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
