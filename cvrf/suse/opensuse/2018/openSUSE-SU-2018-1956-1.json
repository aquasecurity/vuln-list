During\n  the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of\n  td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the\n  ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called\n  based on td_imagelength. If the value of td_imagelength is set close to the\n  amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer\n  (bsc#1082332).\n- CVE-2018-8905: Prevent heap-based buffer overflow in the function\n  LZWDecodeCompat via a crafted TIFF file (bsc#1086408).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.",
