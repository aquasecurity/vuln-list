This is analogous to the CVE-2016-3822 integer overflow in exif.c.  (boo#1108672)\n- CVE-2018-16554: The ProcessGpsInfo function may have allowed a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other impact via a malicious JPEG file, because of inconsistency between float and double in a sprintf format string during TAG_GPS_ALT handling.
