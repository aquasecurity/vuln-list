      "Text": "This update for tiff fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2017-9935: There was a heap-based buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf function in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could lead to different damages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in TIFFClose or t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free in t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code execution (bsc#1046077)\n- CVE-2017-17973: There is a heap-based use-after-free in the t2p_writeproc function in tiff2pdf.c. (bsc#1074318)\n- CVE-2018-5784: There is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the TIFFSetDirectory function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tif file. This occurs because the declared number of directory entries is not validated against the actual number of directory entries (bsc#1081690)\n\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
