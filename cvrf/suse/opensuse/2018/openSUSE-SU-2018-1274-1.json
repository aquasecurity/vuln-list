      "Text": "This update for xen to version 4.9.2 fixes several issues.\n\nThis feature was added:\n\n- Added script, udev rule and systemd service to watch for vcpu online/offline\n  events in a HVM domU. They are triggered via 'xl vcpu-set domU N'\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-8897: Prevent mishandling of debug exceptions on x86 (XSA-260, bsc#1090820)\n- Handle HPET timers in IO-APIC mode correctly to prevent malicious or buggy\n  HVM guests from causing a hypervisor crash or potentially privilege\n  escalation/information leaks (XSA-261, bsc#1090822)\n- Prevent unbounded loop, induced by qemu allowing an attacker to permanently\n  keep a physical CPU core busy (XSA-262, bsc#1090823)\n- CVE-2018-10472: x86 HVM guest OS users (in certain configurations) were able\n  to read arbitrary dom0 files via QMP live insertion of a CDROM, in conjunction\n  with specifying the target file as the backing file of a snapshot\n  (bsc#1089152).\n- CVE-2018-10471: x86 PV guest OS users were able to cause a denial of service\n  (out-of-bounds zero write and hypervisor crash) via unexpected INT 80\n  processing, because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5754 (bsc#1089635).\n- CVE-2018-7540: x86 PV guest OS users were able to cause a denial of service\n  (host OS CPU hang) via non-preemptable L3/L4 pagetable freeing (bsc#1080635).\n- CVE-2018-7541: Guest OS users were able to cause a denial of service\n  (hypervisor crash) or gain privileges by triggering a grant-table transition\n  from v2 to v1 (bsc#1080662).\n- CVE-2018-7542: x86 PVH guest OS users were able to cause a denial of service\n  (NULL pointer dereference and hypervisor crash) by leveraging the mishandling\n  of configurations that lack a Local APIC (bsc#1080634).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- bsc#1087252: Update built-in defaults for xenstored in stubdom, keep default\n  to run xenstored as daemon in dom0\n- bsc#1087251: Preserve xen-syms from xen-dbg.gz to allow processing vmcores\n  with crash(1) \n- bsc#1072834: Prevent unchecked MSR access error\n  \nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update update project.",

      "Description": "A statement in the System Programming Guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual (SDM) was mishandled in the development of some or all operating-system kernels, resulting in unexpected behavior for #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS, as demonstrated by (for example) privilege escalation in Windows, macOS, some Xen configurations, or FreeBSD, or a Linux kernel crash. The MOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL \u003c 3, the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL \u003c 3 is complete. OS kernels may not expect this order of events and may therefore experience unexpected behavior when it occurs.",
