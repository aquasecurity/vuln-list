An attacker with ability to write in a directory where files\n  will be installed could create symbolic links to an arbitrary location and\n  modify content, and possibly permissions to arbitrary files, which could be\n  used for denial of service or possibly privilege escalation (bsc#943457)\n\nThis non-security issue was fixed:\n\n- Use ksym-provides tool [bsc#1077692]\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
