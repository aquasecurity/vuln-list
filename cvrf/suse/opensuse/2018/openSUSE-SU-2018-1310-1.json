      "Text": "This update for librsvg fixes the following issues:\n\n- CVE-2018-1000041: Input validation issue could lead to credentials leak. (bsc#1083232)\n\nUpdate to version 2.40.20:\n\n  + Except for emergencies, this will be the LAST RELEASE of the\n    librsvg-2.40.x series.  We are moving to 2.41, which is vastly\n    improved over the 2.40 series.  The API/ABI there remain unchaged,\n    so we strongly encourage you to upgrade your sources and binaries to\n    librsvg-2.41.x.\n  + bgo#761175 - Allow masks and clips to reuse a node being drawn.\n  + Don't access the file system when deciding whether to load a remote\n    file with a UNC path for a paint server (i.e. don't try to load it at all).\n  + Vistual Studio: fixed and integrated introspection builds, so\n    introspection data is built directly from the Visual Studio project\n    (Chun-wei Fan).\n  + Visual Studio: We now use HIGHENTROPYVA linker option on x64 builds,\n    to enhance the security of built binaries (Chun-wei Fan).\n  + Fix generation of Vala bindings when compiling in read-only source\n    directories (Emmanuele Bassi).\n\nUpdate to version 2.40.19:\n\n  + bgo#621088: Using text objects as clipping paths is now supported.\n  + bgo#587721: Fix rendering of text elements with transformations (Massimo).\n  + bgo#777833 - Fix memory leaks when an RsvgHandle is disposed before\n    being closed (Philip Withnall).\n  + bgo#782098 - Don't pass deprecated options to gtk-doc (Ting-Wei Lan).\n  + bgo#786372 - Fix the default for the 'type' attribute of the \u003cstyle\u003e element.\n  + bgo#785276 - Don't crash on single-byte files.\n  + bgo#634514: Don't render unknown elements and their sub-elements.\n  + bgo#777155 - Ignore patterns that have close-to-zero dimensions.\n  + bgo#634324 - Fix Gaussian blurs with negative scaling.\n  + Fix the \u003cswitch\u003e element; it wasn't working at all.\n  + Fix loading when rsvg_handle_write() is called one byte at a time.\n  + bgo#787895 - Fix incorrect usage of libxml2.  Thanks to Nick Wellnhofer\n    for advice on this.\n  + Backported the test suite machinery from the master branch (Chun-wei Fan,\n    Federico Mena).\n  + We now require Pango 1.38.0 or later (released in 2015).\n  + We now require libxml2 2.9.0 or later (released in 2012).\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update update project.",
