      "Text": "This update for qemu fixes the following issues:\n\nThis update has the next round of Spectre v2 related patches, which\nnow integrate with corresponding changes in libvirt. (CVE-2017-5715\nbsc#1068032)\n\nThe January 2018 release of qemu initially addressed the Spectre v2\nvulnerability for KVM guests by exposing the spec-ctrl feature\nfor all x86 vcpu types, which was the quick and dirty approach,\nbut not the proper solution.\n\nWe replaced our initial patch by the patches from upstream.\n\nThis update defines spec_ctrl and ibpb cpu feature flags as well as new\ncpu models which are clones of existing models with either -IBRS or -IBPB\nadded to the end of the model name. These new vcpu models explicitly\ninclude the new feature(s), whereas the feature flags can be added\nto the cpu parameter as with other features. In short, for continued\nSpectre v2 protection, ensure that either the appropriate cpu feature\nflag is added to the QEMU command-line, or one of the new cpu models is\nused.\n\nAlthough migration from older versions is supported, the new cpu\nfeatures won't be properly exposed to the guest until it is restarted\nwith the cpu features explicitly added. A reboot is insufficient.\n\nA warning patch is added which attempts to detect a migration\nfrom a qemu version which had the quick and dirty fix (it only\ndetects certain cases, but hopefully is helpful.)\nFor additional information on Spectre v2 as it relates to QEMU,\nsee:\n        https://www.qemu.org/2018/02/14/qemu-2-11-1-and-spectre-update/\n\nA patch is added to continue to detect Spectre v2 mitigation\nfeatures (as shown by cpuid), and if found provide that feature\nto guests, even if running on older KVM (kernel) versions which\ndo not yet expose that feature to QEMU. (bsc#1082276)\n\nThese two patches will be removed when we can reasonably assume\neveryone is running with the appropriate updates.\n\nSpectre fixes for IBM Z Series were included by providing more hw features\nto guests (bsc#1076813)\n\nAlso security fixes for the following CVE issues are included:\n\n- CVE-2017-17381: The Virtio Vring implementation in QEMU allowed local OS guest users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and QEMU process crash) by unsetting vring alignment while updating Virtio rings. (bsc#1071228)\n- CVE-2017-16845: The PS2 driver in Qemu did not validate 'rptr' and 'count' values during guest migration, leading to out-of-bounds access. (bsc#1068613)\n- CVE-2017-15119: The Network Block Device (NBD) server in Quick Emulator (QEMU), was vulnerable to a denial of service issue. It could occur if a client sent large option requests, making the server waste CPU time on reading up to 4GB per request. A client could use this flaw to keep the NBD server from serving other requests, resulting in DoS. (bsc#1070144)\n- CVE-2017-18043: Integer overflow in the macro ROUND_UP (n, d) in Quick Emulator (Qemu) allowed a user to cause a denial of service (Qemu process crash). (bsc#1076775)\n- CVE-2018-5683: The VGA driver in Qemu allowed local OS guest privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and QEMU process crash) by leveraging improper memory address validation. (bsc#1076114)\n- CVE-2018-7550: The multiboot functionality in Quick Emulator (aka QEMU) allowed local guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via an out-of-bounds read or write memory access. (bsc#1083291)\n- CVE-2017-15124: VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) was found to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not throttle the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did not consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS to the server host. (bsc#1073489)\n\nAdditional bugs fixed:\n\n- Fix pcihp for 1.6 and older machine types (bsc#1074572)\n- Fix packaging dependencies (coreutils) for qemu-ksm package (bsc#1040202)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update update project.",
