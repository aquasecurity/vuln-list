(bsc#1113978, bsc#1098017)\n- Review dependencies (requires, recommends and supports) (bsc#1082409)\n- Make profile.d/go.sh no longer set GOROOT=, in order to make switching\n  between versions no longer break. This ends up removing the need for go.sh\n  entirely (because GOPATH is also set automatically) (boo#1119634)\n- Fix a regression that broke go get for import path patterns containing '...'\n  (bsc#1119706)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",

      "CVE": "CVE-2018-16873",
      "Description": "In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the \"go get\" command is vulnerable to remote code execution when executed with the -u flag and the import path of a malicious Go package, or a package that imports it directly or indirectly. Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). Using custom domains, it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to a folder named \".git\" by using a vanity import path that ends with \"/.git\". If the Git repository root contains a \"HEAD\" file, a \"config\" file, an \"objects\" directory, a \"refs\" directory, with some work to ensure the proper ordering of operations, \"go get -u\" can be tricked into considering the parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it. That will use the \"config\" file in the original Git repository root for its configuration, and if that config file contains malicious commands, they will execute on the system running \"go get -u\".",
