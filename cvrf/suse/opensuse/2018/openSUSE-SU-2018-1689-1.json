      "Text": "This update for bouncycastle to version 1.59 fixes the following issues:\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2017-13098: BouncyCastle, when configured to use the JCE (Java\n  Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, provided a weak\n  Bleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using RSA key exchange was\n  negotiated. An attacker can recover the private key from a vulnerable\n  application. This vulnerability is referred to as 'ROBOT' (bsc#1072697).\n- CVE-2016-1000338: Ensure full validation of ASN.1 encoding of signature on\n  verification. It was possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making\n  up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may have\n  allowed the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed structure\n  (bsc#1095722).\n- CVE-2016-1000339: Prevent AESEngine key information leak via lookup table\n  accesses (boo#1095853).\n- CVE-2016-1000340: Preventcarry propagation bugs in the implementation of\n  squaring for several raw math classes (boo#1095854).\n- CVE-2016-1000341: Fix DSA signature generation vulnerability to timing attack\n  (boo#1095852).\n- CVE-2016-1000341: DSA signature generation was vulnerable to timing attack.\n  Where timings can be closely observed for the generation of signatures may have\n  allowed an attacker to gain information about the signature's k value and\n  ultimately the private value as well (bsc#1095852).\n- CVE-2016-1000342: Ensure that ECDSA does fully validate ASN.1 encoding of\n  signature on verification. It was possible to inject extra elements in the\n  sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some\n  cases may have allowed the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed\n  structure (bsc#1095850).\n- CVE-2016-1000343: Prevent weak default settings for private DSA key pair\n  generation (boo#1095849).\n- CVE-2016-1000344: Removed DHIES from the provider to disable the unsafe usage\n  of ECB mode (boo#1096026).\n- CVE-2016-1000345: The DHIES/ECIES CBC mode was vulnerable to padding oracle\n  attack. In an environment where timings can be easily observed, it was possible\n  with enough observations to identify when the decryption is failing due to\n  padding (bsc#1096025).\n- CVE-2016-1000346: The other party DH public key was not fully validated. This\n  could have caused issues as invalid keys could be used to reveal details about\n  the other party's private key where static Diffie-Hellman is in use\n  (bsc#1096024).\n- CVE-2016-1000352: Remove ECIES from the provider to disable the unsafe usage\n  of ECB mode (boo#1096022).\n",

Due to the highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used. There was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine has been modified to remove any signs of leakage (testing carried out on Intel X86-64) and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine is now only recommended where otherwise deemed appropriate.",
