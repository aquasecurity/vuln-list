      "Text": "This update for cinnamon fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity issue fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-13054: Fix symlink attack vulnerability (boo#1083067).\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Update to version 3.4.6 (changes since 3.4.4):\n  * osdWindow.js: Always check the theme node on first showing - an\n    actor's width isn't necessarily filled if it hasn't been\n    explicitly set, causing the first few activations of the OSD to not show an accurate level bar.\n  * cs_default: Fix an incorrect button label (but preserve translations).\n  * main.js: Remove an obsolete Meta enum member reference.\n  * workspace.js: Use our normal prototype init method.\n  * workspace.js: Initalise WindowClone._zoomStep to 0.\n  * slideshow-applet: Fix a translation.\n  * cs_themes.py: Create the file '~/.icons/default/index.theme' and\n    set the selected cursor theme inside of it. This ensures other\n    (non-gtk) applications end up using the same theme (though they\n    are required to be restarted for these changes to take effect).\n  * keyboard-applet: Applet icon vanishes when moved in edit mode.\n  * cinnamon-json-makepot: Add keyword option, change language used by xgettext to JavaScript.\n  * expoThumbnail: Correct a couple of calls with mismatched argument counts.\n  * window-list: Set AppMenuButtons unreactive during panel edit mode.\n  * panel-launchers: Set PanelAppLaunchers unreactive during panel edit mode.\n  * windows-quick-list: Fix argument warning.\n  * Fix a reference to undefined actor._delegate warning.\n  * ui/environment: Handle undefined actors in containerClass.prototype.add.\n  * ui/cinnamonDBus: Handle null xlet objects in CinnamonDBus.highlightXlet.\n  * deskletManager: Initialise some variables and remove the\n    variables that were initialised, probable typo\n",

      "Description": "An issue was discovered in Cinnamon 1.9.2 through 3.8.6. The cinnamon-settings-users.py GUI runs as root and allows configuration of (for example) other users' icon files in _on_face_browse_menuitem_activated and _on_face_menuitem_activated. These icon files are written to the respective user's $HOME/.face location. If an unprivileged user prepares a symlink pointing to an arbitrary location, then this location will be overwritten with the icon content.",
