An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file\n  system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that\n  file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects\n  (bsc#1101797)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
