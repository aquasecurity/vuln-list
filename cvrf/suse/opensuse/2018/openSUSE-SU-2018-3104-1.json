      "Text": "\nThis update for brings postgresql10 version 10.5 to openSUSE Leap 42.3. (FATE#325659 bnc#1108308)\n\nThis release marks the change of the versioning scheme for PostgreSQL\nto a 'x.y' format. This means the next minor releases of PostgreSQL\nwill be 10.1, 10.2, ... and the next major release will be 11.\n\n* Logical Replication\n\nLogical replication extends the current replication features of\nPostgreSQL with the ability to send modifications on a per-database\nand per-table level to different PostgreSQL databases. Users can now\nfine-tune the data replicated to various database clusters and will\nhave the ability to perform zero-downtime upgrades to future major\nPostgreSQL versions.\n\n* Declarative Table Partitioning\n\nTable partitioning has existed for years in PostgreSQL but required a\nuser to maintain a nontrivial set of rules and triggers for the\npartitioning to work. PostgreSQL 10 introduces a table partitioning\nsyntax that lets users easily create and maintain range and list\npartitioned tables.\n\n* Improved Query Parallelism\n\nPostgreSQL 10 provides better support for parallelized queries by\nallowing more parts of the query execution process to be\nparallelized. Improvements include additional types of data scans that\nare parallelized as well as optimizations when the data is recombined,\nsuch as pre-sorting. These enhancements allow results to be returned\nmore quickly.\n\n* Quorum Commit for Synchronous Replication\n\nPostgreSQL 10 introduces quorum commit for synchronous replication,\nwhich allows for flexibility in how a primary database receives\nacknowledgement that changes were successfully written to remote\nreplicas.\n\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.",
