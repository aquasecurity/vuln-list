(XSA-275)\n  (bsc#1115040)\n- CVE-2018-19965: Fixed an issue related to the INVPCID instruction in case\n  non-canonical addresses are accessed, which may allow a guest to cause Xen to\n  crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.\n  (XSA-279) (bsc#1115045)\n- CVE-2018-19966: Fixed an issue related to a previous fix for XSA-240, which\n  conflicted with shadow paging and allowed a guest to cause Xen to crash,\n  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). (XSA-280) (bsc#1115047)\n- CVE-2018-18883: Fixed an issue related to inproper restriction of nested VT-x,\n  which allowed a guest to cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service\n  (DoS). (XSA-278) (bsc#1114405)\n- CVE-2018-15468: Fixed incorrect MSR_DEBUGCTL handling, which allowed guests to\n  enable Branch Trace Store and may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) of the\n  entire host. (XSA-269) (bsc#1103276)\n- CVE-2018-15469: Fixed use of v2 grant tables on ARM, which were not properly\n  implemented and may cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (XSA-268) (bsc#1103275)\n- CVE-2018-15470: Fixed an issue in the logic in oxenstored for handling writes,\n  which allowed a guest to write memory unbounded leading to system-wide Denial\n  of Service (DoS). (XSA-272) (bsc#1103279)\n- CVE-2018-3646: Mitigations for VMM aspects of L1 Terminal Fault (XSA-273)\n  (bsc#1091107)\n\nOther bugs fixed:\n\n- Fixed an issue related to a domU hang on SLE12-SP3 HV (bsc#1108940)\n- Fixed an issue with xpti=no-dom0 not working as expected (bsc#1105528)\n- Fixed a kernel oops related to fs/dcache.c called by d_materialise_unique() (bsc#1094508)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.",

      "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR contains several debugging features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do not. In particular, Branch Trace Store is not virtualised by the processor, and software has to be careful to configure it suitably not to lock up the core. As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted guests. Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was skipped, allowing the guest to choose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. A malicious or buggy guest administrator (on Intel x86 HVM or PVH) can lock up the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.",

As indicated in section 7.7.3 \"Operations on data structures\" of the OCaml manual, the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not specified. In practice, different implementations behave differently. Thus, oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity. This allows a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead to a system-wide DoS.",
