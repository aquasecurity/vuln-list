      "Text": "\n  \nGraphicsMagick was updated to 1.3.29:\n\n* Security Fixes:\n\n  - GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project \n  - JNG: Require that the embedded JPEG image have the same dimensions\n    as the JNG image as provided by JHDR. Avoids a heap write overflow.\n  - MNG: Arbitrarily limit the number of loops which may be requested by\n    the MNG LOOP chunk to 512 loops, and provide the '-define\n    mng:maximum-loops=value' option in case the user wants to change the\n    limit.  This fixes a denial of service caused by large LOOP\n    specifications.\n\n* Bug fixes:\n\n  - DICOM: Pre/post rescale functions are temporarily disabled (until\n    the implementation is fixed).\n  - JPEG: Fix regression in last release in which reading some JPEG\n    files produces the error \u0026quot;Improper call to JPEG library in state\n    201\u0026quot;.\n  - ICON: Some DIB-based Windows ICON files were reported as corrupt to\n    an unexpectedly missing opacity mask image.\n  - In-memory Blob I/O: Don't implicitly increase the allocation size\n    due to seek offsets.\n  - MNG: Detect and handle failure to allocate global PLTE. Fix divide\n    by zero.\n  - DrawGetStrokeDashArray(): Check for failure to allocate memory.\n  - BlobToImage(): Now produces useful exception reports to cover the\n    cases where 'magick' was not set and the file format could not be\n    deduced from its header.\n\n* API Updates:\n\n  - Wand API: Added MagickIsPaletteImage(), MagickIsOpaqueImage(),\n    MagickIsMonochromeImage(), MagickIsGrayImage(), MagickHasColormap()\n    based on contributions by Troy Patteson.\n  - New structure ImageExtra added and Image 'clip_mask' member is\n    replaced by 'extra' which points to private ImageExtra allocation.\n    The ImageGetClipMask() function now provides access to the clip mask\n    image.\n  - New structure DrawInfoExtra and DrawInfo 'clip_path' is replaced by\n    'extra' which points to private DrawInfoExtra allocation.  The\n    DrawInfoGetClipPath() function now provides access to the clip path.\n  - New core library functions: GetImageCompositeMask(),\n    CompositeMaskImage(), CompositePathImage(), SetImageCompositeMask(),\n    ImageGetClipMask(), ImageGetCompositeMask(), DrawInfoGetClipPath(),\n    DrawInfoGetCompositePath()\n  - Deprecated core library functions: RegisterStaticModules(),\n    UnregisterStaticModules().\n\n* Feature improvements:\n  - Static modules (in static library or shared library without\n    dynamically loadable modules) are now lazy-loaded using the same\n    external interface as the lazy-loader for dynamic modules.  This\n    results in more similarity between the builds and reduces the fixed\n    initialization overhead by only initializing the modules which are\n    used.\n  - SVG: The quality of SVG support has been significantly improved due\n    to the efforts of Greg Wolfe.\n  - FreeType/TTF rendering: Rendering fixes for opacity.\n\n",
