Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause\n  a denial of service via a crafted pdf file (bsc#1075936).\n- CVE-2017-15369: The build_filter_chain function in pdf/pdf-stream.c\n  mishandled a case where a variable may reside in a register, which allowed\n  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (Fitz fz_drop_imp use-after-free\n  and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted\n  PDF document (bsc#1063413).\n- CVE-2017-15587: Prevent integer overflow in pdf_read_new_xref_section that\n  allowed for DoS (bsc#1064027).\n- CVE-2017-17866: Fixed mishandling of length changes when a repair operation\n  occured during a clean operation, which allowed remote attackers to cause a\n  denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have\n  unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document (bsc#1074116).\n- CVE-2017-17858: Fixed a heap-based buffer overflow in the ensure_solid_xref\n  function which allowed a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary\n  code via a crafted PDF file, because xref subsection object numbers were\n  unrestricted (bsc#1077161).\n\nFor non-security changes please refer to the changelog.\n",
