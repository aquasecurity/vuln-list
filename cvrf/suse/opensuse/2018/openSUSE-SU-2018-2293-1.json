      "Text": "This update for mysql-community-server to version 5.6.41 fixes the following issues:\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-3064: Fixed an easily exploitable vulnerability that allowed a low\n  privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise\n  the MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in\n  unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash\n  (complete DOS) of MySQL Server as well as unauthorized update, insert or\n  delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data. (bsc#1103342)\n\n- CVE-2018-3070: Fixed an easily exploitable vulnerability that allowed a low\n  privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise\n  MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in\n  unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash\n  (complete DOS) of MySQL Server. (bsc#1101679)\n\n- CVE-2018-0739: Fixed a stack exhaustion in case of recursively constructed\n  ASN.1 types. (boo#1087102)\n\n- CVE-2018-3062: Fixed a difficult to exploit vulnerability that allowed\n  low privileged attacker with network access via memcached to compromise\n  MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in\n  unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash\n  (complete DOS) of MySQL Server. (bsc#1103344)\n\n- CVE-2018-3081: Fixed a difficult to exploit vulnerability that allowed\n  high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to\n  compromise MySQL Client. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result\n  in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash\n  (complete DOS) of MySQL Client as well as unauthorized update, insert or\n  delete access to some of MySQL Client accessible data. (bsc#1101680)\n\n- CVE-2018-3058: Fixed an easily exploitable vulnerability that allowed low\n  privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise\n  MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in\n  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server\n  accessible data. (bsc#1101676)\n\n- CVE-2018-3066: Fixed a difficult to exploit vulnerability allowed high\n  privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise\n  MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in\n  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server\n  accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL\n  Server accessible data. (bsc#1101678)\n\n- CVE-2018-2767: Fixed a difficult to exploit vulnerability that allowed low\n  privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise\n  MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in\n  unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Server accessible data.\n  (boo#1088681)\n\nYou can find more detailed information about this update in the\n[release notes](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-41.html)\n",
