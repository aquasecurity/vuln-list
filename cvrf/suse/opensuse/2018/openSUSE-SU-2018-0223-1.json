      "Text": "This update for mysql-community-server to version 5.6.39 fixes several issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-2622: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: DDL. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2562: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server : Partition. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server as well as unauthorized update,\n  insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2640: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: Optimizer. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2665: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: Optimizer).\n  Supported versions that are affected are 5.5.58 and prior, 5.6.38 and prior and\n  5.7.20 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged\n  attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.\n  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to\n  cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\n  (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2668: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: Optimizer. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2696: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server : Security :\n  Privileges). Supported versions that are affected are 5.6.38 and prior and\n  5.7.20 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed unauthenticated\n  attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.\n  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to\n  cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\n  (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2583: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Stored Procedure. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. While the vulnerability is\n  in MySQL Server, attacks may significantly impact additional products.\n  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to\n  cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\n  (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2612: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: InnoDB. Easily exploitable\n  vulnerability allowed high privileged attacker with network access via multiple\n  protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability\n  can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to\n  critical data or all MySQL Server accessible data and unauthorized ability to\n  cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\n  (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2703: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server : Security :\n  Privileges. Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged attacker\n  with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.\n  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to\n  cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\n  (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2573: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: GIS. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed low privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2017-3737: OpenSSL introduced an 'error state' mechanism. The intent was\n  that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into\n  the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the\n  handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions\n  (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it\n  did not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that\n  scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the\n  initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the\n  application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed\n  without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In\n  order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that\n  resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already\n  received a fatal error\n- CVE-2018-2647: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: Replication. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server as well as unauthorized update,\n  insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2591: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server : Partition. Easily\n  exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged attacker with network access\n  via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this\n  vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently\n  repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2590: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: Performance Schema.\n  Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged attacker with network\n  access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of\n  this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or\n  frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server (bsc#1076369).\n- CVE-2018-2645: Vulnerability in the subcomponent: Server: Performance Schema.\n  Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged attacker with network\n  access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of\n  this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or\n  complete access to all MySQL Server accessible data (bsc#1076369).\n\nFor additional details please see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-39.html\n",
