Remote attackers could leverage the vulnerability to cause a denial\n  of service via a crafted pdf file (bsc#1077407).\n- CVE-2018-6544: pdf_load_obj_stm could have referenced the object stream\n  recursively and therefore run out of error stack, which allowed remote\n  attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF document\n  (bsc#1079100).\n- CVE-2018-6192: The pdf_read_new_xref function allowed remote attackers to\n  cause a denial of service (segmentation violation and application crash) via a\n  crafted pdf file (bsc#1077755).\n",
