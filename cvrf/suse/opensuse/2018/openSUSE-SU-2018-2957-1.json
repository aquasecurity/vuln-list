An attacker with sufficient\n  access to mount cache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process\n  could have recovered the private key (bsc#1089039)\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- Add openssl(cli) Provide so the packages that require the openssl\n  binary can require this instead of the new openssl meta package\n  (bsc#1101470)\n- Fixed path to the engines which are under /lib64 on SLE-12 (bsc#1101246,\n  bsc#997043)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update update project.",
