      "Text": "This update for mailman to version 2.1.27 fixes the following issues:\n\nThis security issue was fixed:\n\n- CVE-2018-0618: Additional protections against injecting scripts into listinfo\n  and error messages pages (bsc#1099510).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n\n- The hash generated when SUBSCRIBE_FORM_SECRET is set could have been\n  the same as one generated at the same time for a different list and\n  IP address.\n- An option has been added to bin/add_members to issue invitations\n  instead of immediately adding members.\n- A new BLOCK_SPAMHAUS_LISTED_IP_SUBSCRIBE setting has been added to\n  enable blocking web subscribes from IPv4 addresses listed in Spamhaus\n  SBL, CSS or XBL.  It will work with IPv6 addresses if Python's\n  py2-ipaddress module is installed.  The module can be installed via pip\n  if not included in your Python.\n- Mailman has a new 'security' log and logs authentication failures to the\n  various web CGI functions.  The logged data include the remote IP and can be\n  used to automate blocking of IPs with something like fail2ban.  Since Mailman\n  2.1.14, these have returned an http 401 status and the information should be\n  logged by the web server, but this new log makes that more convenient.  Also,\n  the 'mischief' log entries for 'hostile listname' noe include the remote IP\n  if available.\n- admin notices of (un)subscribes now may give\n  the source of the action.  This consists of a %(whence)s replacement\n  that has been added to the admin(un)subscribeack.txt templates.  Thanks\n  to Yasuhito FUTATSUKI for updating the non-English templates and help\n  with internationalizing the reasons.\n- there is a new BLOCK_SPAMHAUS_LISTED_DBL_SUBSCRIBE setting to enable blocking\n  web subscribes for addresses in domains listed in the Spamhaus DBL.\n",
