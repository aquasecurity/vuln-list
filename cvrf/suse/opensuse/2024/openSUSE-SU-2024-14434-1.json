The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.",

Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.",

      "Description": "There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing\ninside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a network.\n\n",

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.

It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",
