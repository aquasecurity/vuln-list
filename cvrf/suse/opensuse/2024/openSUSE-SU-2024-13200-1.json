      "Description": "A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the way Key Distribution Center (KDC) determines if a service ticket can be used for delegation via Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD).\nTo exploit the vulnerability, a compromised service that is configured to use KCD could tamper with a service ticket that is not valid for delegation to force the KDC to accept it.\nThe update addresses this vulnerability by changing how the KDC validates service tickets used with KCD.",
