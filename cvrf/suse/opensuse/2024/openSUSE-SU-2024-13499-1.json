Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to version 1.3.0, a malicious web server can read arbitrary files on the client using a `\u003cinput type=\"file\" ...\u003e` inside HTML form. All users of MechanicalSoup's form submission are affected, unless they took very specific (and manual) steps to reset HTML form field values. Version 1.3.0 contains a patch for this issue.",
