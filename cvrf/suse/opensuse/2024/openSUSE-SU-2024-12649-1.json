      "Description": "\nA path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction,  would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.\n This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.\n\nThis issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.\n\n",
