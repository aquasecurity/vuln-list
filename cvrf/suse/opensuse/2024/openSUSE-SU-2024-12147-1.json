      "CVE": "CVE-2022-29241",
      "Description": "Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter Notebook. Prior to version 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1.",
