      "Text": "\nThis update for mailman to version 2.1.34 fixes the following issues:\n\n - The fix for lp#1859104 can result in ValueError being thrown\n   on attempts to subscribe to a list. This is fixed and\n   extended to apply REFUSE_SECOND_PENDING to unsubscription as\n   well. (lp#1878458)\n - DMARC mitigation no longer misses if the domain name returned\n   by DNS contains upper case. (lp#1881035)\n - A new WARN_MEMBER_OF_SUBSCRIBE setting can be set to No to\n   prevent mailbombing of a member of a list with private\n   rosters by repeated subscribe attempts. (lp#1883017)\n - Very long filenames for scrubbed attachments are now\n   truncated. (lp#1884456)\n - A content injection vulnerability via the private login page\n   has been fixed. CVE-2020-15011  (lp#1877379, bsc#1173369)\n - A content injection vulnerability via the options login page\n   has been discovered and reported by Vishal Singh.\n   CVE-2020-12108 (lp#1873722, bsc#1171363)\n - Bounce recognition for a non-compliant Yahoo format is added.\n - Archiving workaround for non-ascii in string.lowercase in\n   some Python packages is added.\n - Thanks to Jim Popovitch, there is now\n   a dmarc_moderation_addresses list setting that can be used to\n   apply dmarc_moderation_action to mail From: addresses listed\n   or matching listed regexps. This can be used to modify mail\n   to addresses that don't accept external mail From:\n   themselves.\n - There is a new MAX_LISTNAME_LENGTH setting. The fix for\n   lp#1780874 obtains a list of the names of all the all the\n   lists in the installation in order to determine the maximum\n   length of a legitimate list name. It does this on every web\n   access and on sites with a very large number of lists, this\n   can have performance implications. See the description in\n   Defaults.py for more information.\n - Thanks to Ralf Jung there is now the ability to add text\n   based captchas (aka textchas) to the listinfo subscribe form.\n   See the documentation for the new CAPTCHA setting in\n   Defaults.py for how to enable this. Also note that if you\n   have custom listinfo.html templates, you will have to add\n   a \u003cmm-captcha-ui\u003e tag to those templates to make this work.\n   This feature can be used in combination with or instead of\n   the Google reCAPTCHA feature added in 2.1.26.\n - Thanks to Ralf Hildebrandt the web admin Membership\n   Management section now has a feature to sync the list's\n   membership with a list of email addresses as with the\n   bin/sync_members command.\n - There is a new drop_cc list attribute set from\n   DEFAULT_DROP_CC. This controls the dropping of addresses from\n   the Cc: header in delivered messages by the duplicate\n   avoidance process. (lp#1845751)\n - There is a new REFUSE_SECOND_PENDING mm_cfg.py setting that\n   will cause a second request to subscribe to a list when there\n   is already a pending confirmation for that user. This can be\n   set to Yes to prevent mailbombing of a third party by\n   repeatedly posting the subscribe form. (lp#1859104)\n - Fixed the confirm CGI to catch a rare TypeError on\n   simultaneous confirmations of the same token. (lp#1785854)\n - Scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts will now be\n   given a .bin extension instead of .obj. CVE-2020-12137\n   (lp#1886117)\n - Added bounce recognition for a non-compliant opensmtpd DSN\n   with Action: error. (lp#1805137)\n - Corrected and augmented some security log messages.\n   (lp#1810098)\n - Implemented use of QRUNNER_SLEEP_TIME for bin/qrunner\n   --runner=All. (lp#1818205)\n - Leading/trailing spaces in provided email addresses for login\n   to private archives and the user options page are now\n   ignored. (lp#1818872)\n - Fixed the spelling of the --no-restart option for mailmanctl.\n - Fixed an issue where certain combinations of charset and\n   invalid characters in a list's description could produce\n   a List-ID header without angle brackets. (lp#1831321)\n - With the Postfix MTA and virtual domains, mappings for the\n   site list -bounces and -request addresses in each virtual\n   domain are now added to data/virtual-mailman (-owner was done\n   in 2.1.24). (lp#1831777)\n - The paths.py module now extends sys.path with the result of\n   site.getsitepackages() if available. (lp#1838866)\n - A bug causing a UnicodeDecodeError in preparing to send the\n   confirmation request message to a new subscriber has been\n   fixed. (lp#1851442)\n - The SimpleMatch heuristic bounce recognizer has been improved\n   to not return most invalid email addresses. (lp#1859011)\n    \nThis update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.2:Update update project.",
