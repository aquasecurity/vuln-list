Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8 and 15; Java SE Embedded: 8u261. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.
