(boo#1127341)\n\n- CVE-2019-7314: Mishandled termination of an RTSP stream after RTP/RTCP-over-RTSP has been set up could have lead to a Use-After-Free error causing the RTSP server to crash or possibly have unspecified other impact. (boo#1124159)\n\n- Update to version 2019.06.28, \n- Convert to dynamic libraries (boo#1121995):\n  + Use make ilinux-with-shared-libraries: build the dynamic libs\n    instead of the static one.\n  + Use make install instead of a manual file copy script: this\n    also reveals that we missed quite a bit of code to be installed\n    before.\n  + Split out shared library packages according the SLPP.\n- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.\n\n\nThis update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update update project.",
