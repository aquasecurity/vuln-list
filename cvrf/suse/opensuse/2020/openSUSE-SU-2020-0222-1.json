added local generation of PMK-R0/PMK-R1 for FT-PSK\n    (ft_psk_generate_local=1)\n  - replaced inter-AP protocol with a cleaner design that is more\n    easily extensible; this breaks backward compatibility and requires\n    all APs in the ESS to be updated at the same time to maintain FT\n    functionality\n  -

added support for Password Identifier\n* hostapd_cli: added support for command history and completion\n* added support for requesting beacon report\n* large number of other fixes, cleanup, and extensions\n* added option to configure EAPOL-Key retry limits\n  (wpa_group_update_count and wpa_pairwise_update_count)\n* removed all PeerKey functionality\n* fixed nl80211 AP mode configuration regression with Linux 4.15 and\n  newer\n* added support for using wolfSSL cryptographic library\n* fixed some 20/40 MHz coexistence cases where the BSS could drop to\n  20 MHz even when 40 MHz would be allowed\n* Hotspot 2.0\n  - added support for setting Venue URL ANQP-element (venue_url)\n  - added support for advertising Hotspot 2.0 operator icons\n  - added support for Roaming Consortium Selection element\n  - added support for Terms and Conditions\n  - added support for OSEN connection in a shared RSN BSS\n* added support for using OpenSSL 1.1.1\n* added EAP-pwd server support for salted passwords\n\n",
