This means that Grafana no longer ships with a built-in image renderer, and we advise you to install the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.\n  - Dashboard: A global minimum dashboard refresh interval is now enforced and defaults to 5 seconds.\n  - Interval calculation: There is now a new option Max data points that controls the auto interval $__interval calculation. Interval was previously calculated by dividing the panel width by the time range. With the new max data points option it is now easy to set $__interval to a dynamic value that is time range agnostic. For example if you set Max data points to 10 Grafana will dynamically set $__interval by dividing the current time range by 10.\n  - Datasource/Loki: Support for deprecated Loki endpoints has been removed.\n  - Backend plugins: Grafana now requires backend plugins to be signed, otherwise Grafana will not load/start them. This is an additional security measure to make sure backend plugin binaries and files haven't been tampered with. Refer to Upgrade Grafana for more information.\n  - @grafana/ui: Forms migration notice, see @grafana/ui changelog\n  - @grafana/ui: Select API change for creating custom values, see @grafana/ui changelog\n  + Deprecation warnings\n    - Scripted dashboards is now deprecated. The feature is not removed but will be in a future release. We hope to address the underlying requirement of dynamic dashboards in a different way. #24059\n    - The unofficial first version of backend plugins together with usage of grafana/grafana-plugin-model is now deprecated and support for that will be removed in a future release. Please refer to backend plugins documentation for information about the new officially supported backend plugins.\n\n* Features / Enhancements\n\n  - Backend plugins: Log deprecation warning when using the unofficial first version of backend plugins. #24675, @marefr\n  - Editor: New line on Enter, run query on Shift+Enter. #24654, @davkal\n  - Loki: Allow multiple derived fields with the same name. #24437, @aocenas\n  - Orgs: Add future deprecation notice. #24502, @torkelo\n\n* Bug Fixes\n\n  - @grafana/toolkit: Use process.cwd() instead of PWD to get directory. #24677, @zoltanbedi\n  - Admin: Makes long settings values line break in settings page. #24559, @hugohaggmark\n  - Dashboard: Allow editing provisioned dashboard JSON and add confirmation when JSON is copied to dashboard. #24680, @dprokop\n  - Dashboard: Fix for strange 'dashboard not found' errors when opening links in dashboard settings. #24416, @torkelo\n  - Dashboard: Fix so default data source is selected when data source can't be found in panel editor. #24526, @mckn\n  - Dashboard: Fixed issue changing a panel from transparent back to normal in panel editor. #24483, @torkelo\n  - Dashboard: Make header names reflect the field name when exporting to CSV file from the the panel inspector. #24624, @peterholmberg\n  - Dashboard: Make sure side pane is displayed with tabs by default in panel editor. #24636, @dprokop\n  - Data source: Fix query/annotation help content formatting. #24687, @AgnesToulet\n  - Data source: Fixes async mount errors. #24579, @Estrax\n  - Data source: Fixes saving a data source without failure when URL doesn't specify a protocol. #24497, @aknuds1\n  - Explore/Prometheus: Show results of instant queries only in table. #24508, @ivanahuckova\n  - Explore: Fix rendering of react query editors. #24593, @ivanahuckova\n  - Explore: Fixes loading more logs in logs context view. #24135, @Estrax\n  - Graphite: Fix schema and dedupe strategy in rollup indicators for Metrictank queries. #24685, @torkelo\n  - Graphite: Makes query annotations work again. #24556, @hugohaggmark\n  - Logs: Clicking 'Load more' from context overlay doesn't expand log row. #24299, @kaydelaney\n  - Logs: Fix total bytes process calculation. #24691, @davkal\n  - Org/user/team preferences: Fixes so UI Theme can be set back to Default. #24628, @AgnesToulet\n  - Plugins: Fix manifest validation. #24573, @aknuds1\n  - Provisioning: Use proxy as default access mode in provisioning. #24669, @bergquist\n  - Search: Fix select item when pressing enter and Grafana is served using a sub path. #24634, @tskarhed\n  - Search: Save folder expanded state. #24496, @Clarity-89\n  - Security: Tag value sanitization fix in OpenTSDB data source. #24539, @rotemreiss\n  - Table: Do not include angular options in options when switching from angular panel. #24684, @torkelo\n  - Table: Fixed persisting column resize for time series fields. #24505, @torkelo\n  - Table: Fixes Cannot read property subRows of null. #24578, @hugohaggmark\n  - Time picker: Fixed so you can enter a relative range in the time picker without being converted to absolute range. #24534, @mckn\n  - Transformations: Make transform dropdowns not cropped. #24615, @dprokop\n  - Transformations: Sort order should be preserved as entered by user when using the reduce transformation. #24494, @hugohaggmark\n  - Units: Adds scale symbol for currencies with suffixed symbol. #24678, @hugohaggmark\n  - Variables: Fixes filtering options with more than 1000 entries. #24614, @hugohaggmark\n  - Variables: Fixes so Textbox variables read value from url. #24623, @hugohaggmark\n  - Zipkin: Fix error when span contains remoteEndpoint. #24524, @aocenas\n  - SAML: Switch from email to login for user login attribute mapping (Enterprise)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update update project.",
