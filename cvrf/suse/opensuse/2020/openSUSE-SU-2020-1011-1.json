      "Text": "This update for singularity fixes the following issues:\n\n- New version 3.6.0. This version introduces a new signature format \nfor SIF images, and changes to the signing / verification code to address\nthe following security problems:\n  - CVE-2020-13845, boo#1174150\n  In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, issues allow the ECL to \n  be bypassed by a malicious user.\n  - CVE-2020-13846, boo#1174148\n  In Singularity 3.5 the --all / -a option to singularity verify \n  returns success even when some objects in a SIF container are not signed, \n  or cannot be verified.\n  - CVE-2020-13847, boo#1174152\n  In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, Singularity's sign and verify \n  commands do not sign metadata found in the global header or data object \n  descriptors of a SIF file, allowing an attacker to cause unexpected \n  behavior. A signed container may verify successfully, even when it has \n  been modified in ways that could be exploited to cause malicious behavior.\n\n- New features / functionalities\n  - A new '--legacy-insecure' flag to verify allows verification of SIF\n  signatures in the old, insecure format.\n  - A new '-l / --logs' flag for instance list that shows the paths \n  to instance STDERR / STDOUT log files.\n  - The --json output of instance list now include paths to \n  STDERR / STDOUT log files.\n  - Singularity now supports the execution of minimal Docker/OCI\n  containers that do not contain /bin/sh, e.g. docker://hello-world.\n  - A new cache structure is used that is concurrency safe on a filesystem that\n  supports atomic rename. If you downgrade to Singularity 3.5 or older after\n  using 3.6 you will need to run singularity cache clean.\n  - A plugin system rework adds new hook points that will allow the\n  development of plugins that modify behavior of the runtime. An image driver\n  concept is introduced for plugins to support new ways of handling image and\n  overlay mounts. Plugins built for \u003c=3.5 are not compatible with 3.6.\n  - The --bind flag can now bind directories from a SIF or ext3 image into a\n  container.\n  - The --fusemount feature to mount filesystems to a container via FUSE\n  drivers is now a supported feature (previously an experimental hidden flag).\n  - This permits users to mount e.g. sshfs and cvmfs filesystems to the\n  container at runtime.\n  - A new -c/--config flag allows an alternative singularity.conf to be\n  specified by the root user, or all users in an unprivileged installation.\n  - A new --env flag allows container environment variables to be set via the\n  Singularity command line.\n  - A new --env-file flag allows container environment variables to be set from\n  a specified file.\n  - A new --days flag for cache clean allows removal of items older than a\n  specified number of days. Replaces the --name flag which is not generally\n  useful as the cache entries are stored by hash, not a friendly name.\n\n- Changed defaults / behaviours\n - New signature format (see security fixes above).\n - Fixed spacing of singularity instance list to be dynamically changing \n based off of input lengths instead of fixed number of spaces to account\n for long instance names.\n - Environment variables prefixed with SINGULARITYENV_ always take\n precedence over variables without SINGULARITYENV_ prefix.\n - The %post build section inherits environment variables from the base image.\n - %files from ... will now follow symlinks for sources that are directly\n specified, or directly resolved from a glob pattern. It will not follow\n symlinks found through directory traversal. This mirrors Docker multi-stage\n COPY behaviour.\n - Restored the CWD mount behaviour of v2, implying that CWD path is not recreated\n inside container and any symlinks in the CWD path are not resolved anymore to\n determine the destination path inside container.\n - The %test build section is executed the same manner as singularity test image.\n --fusemount with the container: default directive will foreground the FUSE\n process. Use container-daemon: for previous behavior.\n\n- Deprecate -a / --all option to sign/verify as new signature behavior \n  makes this the default.\n- For more information about upstream changes, please check:\n  https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n- Removed --name flag for cache clean; replaced with --days.\n",
