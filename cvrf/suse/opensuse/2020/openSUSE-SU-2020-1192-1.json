This\n   enables the Python plugin (which uses python2) to be built on\n   newer systems which have both python2 and python3.\n- CVE-2020-15917: Fixed an improper handling of suffix data after STARTTLS is mishandled (boo#1174457).\n\nThis update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.2:Update update project.",
