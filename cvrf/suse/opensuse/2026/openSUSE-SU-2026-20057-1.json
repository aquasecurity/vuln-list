      "Text": "This update for docker fixes the following issues:\n\nChanges in docker:\n\n- Update to Docker 28.5.1-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u003chttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/28/#2851\u003e\n\n- Update to Docker 28.5.0-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u003chttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/28/#2850\u003e\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.29.0. Upstream changelog:\n  \u003chttps://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.29.0\u003e\n\n- Remove git-core recommends on SLE. Most SLE systems have\n  installRecommends=yes by default and thus end up installing git with Docker.\n  bsc#1250508\n\n  This feature is mostly intended for developers (\"docker build git://\") so\n  most users already have the dependency installed, and the error when git is\n  missing is fairly straightforward (so they can easily figure out what they\n  need to install).\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.28.0. Upstream changelog:\n  \u003chttps://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.28.0\u003e\n\n- Update to Docker 28.4.0-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u003chttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/28/#2840\u003e\n  * Fixes a nil pointer panic in \"docker push\". bsc#1248373\n\n- Update warnings and errors related to \"docker buildx ...\" so that they\n  reference our openSUSE docker-buildx packages.\n\n- Enable building docker-buildx for SLE15 systems with SUSEConnect secret\n  injection enabled. PED-12534 PED-8905 bsc#1247594\n\n  As docker-buildx does not support our SUSEConnect secret injection (and some\n  users depend \"docker build\" working transparently), patch the docker CLI so\n  that \"docker build\" will no longer automatically call \"docker buildx build\",\n  effectively making DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 the default configuration. Users can\n  manually use \"docker buildx ...\" commands or set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 in order\n  to opt-in to using docker-buildx.\n\n  Users can silence the \"docker build\" warning by setting DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0\n  explicitly.\n\n  In order to inject SCC credentials with docker-buildx, users should use\n\n    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SCCcredentials zypper -n ...\n\n  in their Dockerfiles, and\n\n    docker buildx build --secret id=SCCcredentials,src=/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials,type=file .\n\n  when doing their builds.\n\n- Update to Docker 28.3.3-ce. See upstream changelog online at\n  \u003chttps://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/28/#2833\u003e\n  CVE-2025-54388 bsc#1247367\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.26.1. Upstream changelog:\n  \u003chttps://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.26.1\u003e\n\n- Update to docker-buildx v0.26.0. Upstream changelog:\n  \u003chttps://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.26.0\u003e\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2025-54388",
      "Description": "Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. In versions 28.2.0 through 28.3.2, when the firewalld service is reloaded it removes all iptables rules including those created by Docker. While Docker should automatically recreate these rules, versions before 28.3.3 fail to recreate the specific rules that block external access to containers. This means that after a firewalld reload, containers with ports published to localhost (like 127.0.0.1:8080) become accessible from remote machines that have network routing to the Docker bridge, even though they should only be accessible from the host itself. The vulnerability only affects explicitly published ports - unpublished ports remain protected. This issue is fixed in version 28.3.3.",
