      "Text": "This update for python313 fixes the following issues:\n\n- Update to 3.13.11:\n\n- Security\n    - CVE-2025-12084: cpython: Fixed quadratic algorithm in\n      xml.dom.minidom leading to denial of service (bsc#1254997)\n    - CVE-2025-13836: Fixed default Content-Lenght read amount\n      from HTTP response (bsc#1254400)\n    - CVE-2025-13837: Fixed plistlib module denial of service (bsc#1254401)\n    - CVE-2025-8291: Fixed validity of the ZIP64 End of Central Directory\n      (EOCD) not checked by the 'zipfile' module (bsc#1251305)\n    - gh-137836: Add support of the “plaintext” element, RAWTEXT\n      elements “xmp”, “iframe”, “noembed” and “noframes”, and\n      optionally RAWTEXT element “noscript” in\n      html.parser.HTMLParser.\n    - gh-136063: email.message: ensure linear complexity for\n      legacy HTTP parameters parsing. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - CVE-2025-6075: Fixed performance issues caused by user-controller\n      os.path.expandvars() (bsc#1252974)\n- Library\n    - gh-140797: Revert changes to the undocumented re.Scanner\n      class. Capturing groups are still allowed for backward\n      compatibility, although using them can lead to incorrect\n      result. They will be forbidden in future Python versions.\n    - gh-142206: The resource tracker in the multiprocessing\n      module now uses the original communication protocol, as in\n      Python 3.14.0 and below, by default. This avoids issues\n      with upgrading Python while it is running. (Note that such\n      ‘in-place’ upgrades are not tested.) The tracker remains\n      compatible with subprocesses that use new protocol (that\n      is, subprocesses using Python 3.13.10, 3.14.1 and 3.15).\n- Core and Builtins\n    - gh-142218: Fix crash when inserting into a split table\n      dictionary with a non str key that matches an existing key.\n\n\n- Update to 3.13.10:\n\n- Tools/Demos\n    - gh-141442: The iOS testbed now correctly handles test\n      arguments that contain spaces.\n- Tests\n    - gh-140482: Preserve and restore the state of stty echo as\n      part of the test environment.\n    - gh-140082: Update python -m test to set FORCE_COLOR=1 when\n      being run with color enabled so that unittest which is run\n      by it with redirected output will output in color.\n    - gh-136442: Use exitcode 1 instead of 5 if\n      unittest.TestCase.setUpClass() raises an exception\n- Library\n    - gh-74389: When the stdin being used by a subprocess.Popen\n      instance is closed, this is now ignored in\n      subprocess.Popen.communicate() instead of leaving the class\n      in an inconsistent state.\n    - gh-87512: Fix subprocess.Popen.communicate() timeout\n      handling on Windows when writing large input. Previously,\n      the timeout was ignored during stdin writing, causing the\n      method to block indefinitely if the child process did not\n      consume input quickly. The stdin write is now performed in\n      a background thread, allowing the timeout to be properly\n      enforced.\n    - gh-141473: When subprocess.Popen.communicate() was called\n      with input and a timeout and is called for a second time\n      after a TimeoutExpired exception before the process has\n      died, it should no longer hang.\n    - gh-59000: Fix pdb breakpoint resolution for class methods\n      when the module defining the class is not imported.\n    - gh-141570: Support file-like object raising OSError from\n      fileno() in color detection (_colorize.can_colorize()).\n      This can occur when sys.stdout is redirected.\n    - gh-141659: Fix bad file descriptor errors from\n      _posixsubprocess on AIX.\n    - gh-141497: ipaddress: ensure that the methods\n      IPv4Network.hosts() and IPv6Network.hosts() always return\n      an iterator.\n    - gh-140938: The statistics.stdev() and statistics.pstdev()\n      functions now raise a ValueError when the input contains an\n      infinity or a NaN.\n    - gh-124111: Updated Tcl threading configuration in _tkinter\n      to assume that threads are always available in Tcl 9 and\n      later.\n    - gh-137109: The os.fork and related forking APIs will no\n      longer warn in the common case where Linux or macOS\n      platform APIs return the number of threads in a process and\n      find the answer to be 1 even when a os.register_at_fork()\n      after_in_parent= callback (re)starts a thread.\n    - gh-141314: Fix assertion failure in io.TextIOWrapper.tell()\n      when reading files with standalone carriage return (\\r)\n      line endings.\n    - gh-141311: Fix assertion failure in io.BytesIO.readinto()\n      and undefined behavior arising when read position is above\n      capcity in io.BytesIO.\n    - gh-141141: Fix a thread safety issue with\n      base64.b85decode(). Contributed by Benel Tayar.\n    - gh-140911: collections: Ensure that the methods\n      UserString.rindex() and UserString.index() accept\n      collections.UserString instances as the sub argument.\n    - gh-140797: The undocumented re.Scanner class now forbids\n      regular expressions containing capturing groups in its\n      lexicon patterns. Patterns using capturing groups could\n      previously lead to crashes with segmentation fault. Use\n      non-capturing groups (?:…) instead.\n    - gh-140815: faulthandler now detects if a frame or a code\n      object is invalid or freed. Patch by Victor Stinner.\n    - gh-100218: Correctly set errno when socket.if_nametoindex()\n      or socket.if_indextoname() raise an OSError. Patch by\n      Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-140875: Fix handling of unclosed character references\n      (named and numerical) followed by the end of file in\n      html.parser.HTMLParser with convert_charrefs=False.\n    - gh-140734: multiprocessing: fix off-by-one error when\n      checking the length of a temporary socket file path. Patch\n      by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-140874: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to\n      version 25.3\n    - gh-140691: In urllib.request, when opening a FTP URL fails\n      because a data connection cannot be made, the control\n      connection’s socket is now closed to avoid\n      a ResourceWarning.\n    - gh-103847: Fix hang when cancelling process created by\n      asyncio.create_subprocess_exec() or\n      asyncio.create_subprocess_shell().

Patch by Sergey Miryanov.\n    - gh-140634: Fix a reference counting bug in\n      os.sched_param.__reduce__().\n    - gh-140633: Ignore AttributeError when setting a module’s\n      __file__ attribute when loading an extension module\n      packaged as Apple Framework.\n    - gh-140593: xml.parsers.expat: Fix a memory leak that could\n      affect users with ElementDeclHandler() set to a custom\n      element declaration handler. Patch by Sebastian Pipping.\n    - gh-140607: Inside io.RawIOBase.read(), validate that the\n      count of bytes returned by io.RawIOBase.readinto() is valid\n      (inside the provided buffer).\n    - gh-138162: Fix logging.LoggerAdapter with merge_extra=True\n      and without the extra argument.\n    - gh-140474: Fix memory leak in array.array when creating\n      arrays from an empty str and the u type code.\n    - gh-140272: Fix memory leak in the clear() method of the\n      dbm.gnu database.\n    - gh-140041: Fix import of ctypes on Android and Cygwin when\n      ABI flags are present.\n    - gh-139905: Add suggestion to error message for\n      typing.Generic subclasses when cls.__parameters__ is\n      missing due to a parent class failing to call\n      super().__init_subclass__() in its __init_subclass__.\n    - gh-139845: Fix to not print KeyboardInterrupt twice in\n      default asyncio REPL.\n    - gh-139783: Fix inspect.getsourcelines() for the case when\n      a decorator is followed by a comment or an empty line.\n    - gh-70765: http.server: fix default handling of HTTP/0.9\n      requests in BaseHTTPRequestHandler. Previously,\n      BaseHTTPRequestHandler.parse_request() incorrectly waited\n      for headers in the request although those are not supported\n      in HTTP/0.9. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-139391: Fix an issue when, on non-Windows platforms, it\n      was not possible to gracefully exit a python -m asyncio\n      process suspended by Ctrl+Z and later resumed by fg other\n      than with kill.\n    - gh-101828: Fix 'shift_jisx0213', 'shift_jis_2004',\n      'euc_jisx0213' and 'euc_jis_2004' codecs truncating null\n      chars as they were treated as part of multi-character\n      sequences.\n    - gh-139246: fix: paste zero-width in default repl width is\n      wrong.\n    - gh-90949: Add SetAllocTrackerActivationThreshold() and\n      SetAllocTrackerMaximumAmplification() to xmlparser objects\n      to prevent use of disproportional amounts of dynamic memory\n      from within an Expat parser. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-139065: Fix trailing space before a wrapped long word if\n      the line length is exactly width in textwrap.\n    - gh-138993: Dedent credits text.\n    - gh-138859: Fix generic type parameterization raising\n      a TypeError when omitting a ParamSpec that has a default\n      which is not a list of types.\n    - gh-138775: Use of python -m with base64 has been fixed to\n      detect input from a terminal so that it properly notices\n      EOF.\n    - gh-98896: Fix a failure in multiprocessing resource_tracker\n      when SharedMemory names contain colons.

Patch by Sergey B\n      Kirpichev.\n    - gh-105487: Remove non-existent __copy__(), __deepcopy__(), and\n      __bases__ from the __dir__() entries of types.GenericAlias.\n    - gh-134163: Fix a hang when the process is out of memory inside\n      an exception handler.\n    - gh-138479: Fix a crash when a generic object’s __typing_subst__\n      returns an object that isn’t a tuple.\n    - gh-137576: Fix for incorrect source code being shown in\n      tracebacks from the Basic REPL when PYTHONSTARTUP is given.\n      Patch by Adam Hartz.\n    - gh-132744: Certain calls now check for runaway recursion and\n      respect the system recursion limit.\n  - C API\n    - gh-87135: Attempting to acquire the GIL after runtime\n      finalization has begun in a different thread now causes the\n      thread to hang rather than terminate, which avoids potential\n      crashes or memory corruption caused by attempting to terminate a\n      thread that is running code not specifically designed to support\n      termination. In most cases this hanging is harmless since the\n      process will soon exit anyway.\n      While not officially marked deprecated until 3.14,\n      PyThread_exit_thread is no longer called internally and remains\n      solely for interface compatibility. Its behavior is inconsistent\n      across platforms, and it can only be used safely in the unlikely\n      case that every function in the entire call stack has been\n      designed to support the platform-dependent termination\n      mechanism. It is recommended that users of this function change\n      their design to not require thread termination. In the unlikely\n      case that thread termination is needed and can be done safely,\n      users may migrate to calling platform-specific APIs such as\n      pthread_exit (POSIX) or _endthreadex (Windows) directly.\n  - Build\n    - gh-135734: Python can correctly be configured and built with\n      ./configure --enable-optimizations --disable-test-modules.\n      Previously, the profile data generation step failed due to PGO\n      tests where immortalization couldn’t be properly suppressed.\n\n\n- Update to 3.13.7:\n\n  - gh-137583: Fix a deadlock introduced in 3.13.6 when a call\n    to ssl.SSLSocket.recv was blocked in one thread, and then\n    another method on the object (such as ssl.SSLSocket.send) was\n    subsequently called in another thread.\n  - gh-137044: Return large limit values as positive integers\n    instead of negative integers in resource.getrlimit().\n    Accept large values and reject negative values (except\n    RLIM_INFINITY) for limits in resource.setrlimit().\n  - gh-136914: Fix retrieval of doctest.DocTest.lineno\n    for objects decorated with functools.cache() or\n    functools.cached_property.\n  - gh-131788: Make ResourceTracker.send from multiprocessing\n    re-entrant safe\n  - gh-136155: We are now checking for fatal errors in EPUB\n    builds in CI.\n  - gh-137400: Fix a crash in the free threading build when\n    disabling profiling or tracing across all threads with\n    PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads() or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads()\n    or their Python equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads()\n    and threading.setprofile_all_threads().\n\n\n- Update to 3.13.6:\n\n  - Security\n    - gh-135661: Fix parsing start and end tags in\n      html.parser.HTMLParser according to the HTML5 standard.\n    - gh-102555: Fix comment parsing in html.parser.HTMLParser\n      according to the HTML5 standard.\n    - CVE-2025-6069: Fix quadratic complexity in processing specially\n      crafted input in html.parser.HTMLParser. End-of-file errors\n      are now handled according to the HTML5 specs – comments and\n      declarations are automatically closed, tags are ignored\n      (gh-135462, bsc#1244705).\n    - CVE-2025-8194: tarfile now validates archives to ensure member\n      offsets are non-negative. (gh-130577, bsc#1247249).\n    - gh-118350: Fix support of escapable raw text mode (elements\n      “textarea” and “title”) in html.parser.HTMLParser.\n  - Core and Builtins\n    - gh-58124: Fix name of the Python encoding in Unicode errors\n      of the code page codec: use “cp65000” and “cp65001” instead\n      of “CP_UTF7” and “CP_UTF8” which are not valid Python code\n      names. Patch by Victor Stinner.\n    - gh-137314: Fixed a regression where raw f-strings\n      incorrectly interpreted escape sequences in format\n      specifications. Raw f-strings now properly preserve literal\n      backslashes in format specs, matching the behavior from\n      Python 3.11. For example, rf\"{obj:\\xFF}\" now correctly\n      produces '\\\\xFF' instead of 'ÿ'. Patch by Pablo Galindo.\n    - gh-136541: Fix some issues with the perf trampolines\n      on x86-64 and aarch64. The trampolines were not being\n      generated correctly for some cases, which could lead to\n      the perf integration not working correctly. Patch by Pablo\n      Galindo.\n    - gh-109700: Fix memory error handling in\n      PyDict_SetDefault().\n    - gh-78465: Fix error message for cls.__new__(cls, ...) where\n      cls is not instantiable builtin or extension type (with\n      tp_new set to NULL).\n    - gh-135871: Non-blocking mutex lock attempts now return\n      immediately when the lock is busy instead of briefly\n      spinning in the free threading build.\n    - gh-135607: Fix potential weakref races in an object’s\n      destructor on the free threaded build.\n    - gh-135496: Fix typo in the f-string conversion type error\n      (“exclamanation” -\u003e “exclamation”).\n    - gh-130077: Properly raise custom syntax errors when\n      incorrect syntax containing names that are prefixes of soft\n      keywords is encountered. Patch by Pablo Galindo.\n    - gh-135148: Fixed a bug where f-string debug expressions\n      (using =) would incorrectly strip out parts of strings\n      containing escaped quotes and # characters. Patch by Pablo\n      Galindo.\n    - gh-133136: Limit excess memory usage in the free threading\n      build when a large dictionary or list is resized and\n      accessed by multiple threads.\n    - gh-132617: Fix dict.update() modification check that could\n      incorrectly raise a “dict mutated during update” error when\n      a different dictionary was modified that happens to share\n      the same underlying keys object.\n    - gh-91153: Fix a crash when a bytearray is concurrently\n      mutated during item assignment.\n    - gh-127971: Fix off-by-one read beyond the end of a string\n      in string search.\n    - gh-125723: Fix crash with gi_frame.f_locals when generator\n      frames outlive their generator. Patch by Mikhail Efimov.\n  - Library\n    - gh-132710: If possible, ensure that uuid.getnode()\n      returns the same result even across different processes.\n      Previously, the result was constant only within the same\n      process. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-137273: Fix debug assertion failure in\n      locale.setlocale() on Windows.\n    - gh-137257: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to\n      version 25.2\n    - gh-81325: tarfile.TarFile now accepts a path-like when\n      working on a tar archive. (Contributed by Alexander Enrique\n      Urieles Nieto in gh-81325.)\n    - gh-130522: Fix unraisable TypeError raised during\n      interpreter shutdown in the threading module.\n    - gh-136549: Fix signature of threading.excepthook().\n    - gh-136523: Fix wave.Wave_write emitting an unraisable when\n      open raises.\n    - gh-52876: Add missing keepends (default True)\n      parameter to codecs.StreamReaderWriter.readline() and\n      codecs.StreamReaderWriter.readlines().\n    - gh-85702: If zoneinfo._common.load_tzdata is given a\n      package without a resource a zoneinfo.ZoneInfoNotFoundError\n      is raised rather than a PermissionError. Patch by Victor\n      Stinner.\n    - gh-134759: Fix UnboundLocalError in\n      email.message.Message.get_payload() when the payload to\n      decode is a bytes object. Patch by Kliment Lamonov.\n    - gh-136028: Fix parsing month names containing “İ” (U+0130,\n      LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE) in time.strptime().\n      This affects locales az_AZ, ber_DZ, ber_MA and crh_UA.\n    - gh-135995: In the palmos encoding, make byte 0x9b decode to\n      › (U+203A - SINGLE RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK).\n    - gh-53203: Fix time.strptime() for %c and %x formats on\n      locales byn_ER, wal_ET and lzh_TW, and for %X format on\n      locales ar_SA, bg_BG and lzh_TW.\n    - gh-91555: An earlier change, which was introduced in\n      3.13.4, has been reverted. It disabled logging for a logger\n      during handling of log messages for that logger. Since the\n      reversion, the behaviour should be as it was before 3.13.4.\n    - gh-135878: Fixes a crash of types.SimpleNamespace on free\n      threading builds, when several threads were calling its\n      __repr__() method at the same time.\n    - gh-135836: Fix IndexError in\n      asyncio.loop.create_connection() that could occur when\n      non-OSError exception is raised during connection and\n      socket’s close() raises OSError.\n    - gh-135836: Fix IndexError in\n      asyncio.loop.create_connection() that could occur when the\n      Happy Eyeballs algorithm resulted in an empty exceptions\n      list during connection attempts.\n    - gh-135855: Raise TypeError instead of SystemError when\n      _interpreters.set___main___attrs() is passed a non-dict\n      object. Patch by Brian Schubert.\n    - gh-135815: netrc: skip security checks if os.getuid() is\n      missing. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-135640: Address bug where it was possible to call\n      xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree.write() on an ElementTree\n      object with an invalid root element. This behavior blanked\n      the file passed to write if it already existed.\n    - gh-135444: Fix asyncio.DatagramTransport.sendto() to\n      account for datagram header size when data cannot be sent.\n    - gh-135497: Fix os.getlogin() failing for longer usernames\n      on BSD-based platforms.\n    - gh-135487: Fix reprlib.Repr.repr_int() when given integers\n      with more than sys.get_int_max_str_digits() digits. Patch\n      by Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-135335: multiprocessing: Flush stdout and stderr after\n      preloading modules in the forkserver.\n    - gh-135244: uuid: when the MAC address cannot be\n      determined, the 48-bit node ID is now generated with a\n      cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator\n      (CSPRNG) as per RFC 9562, §6.10.3.

Patch by\n      Bénédikt Tran.\n    - gh-133439: Fix dot commands with trailing spaces are\n      mistaken for multi-line SQL statements in the sqlite3\n      command-line interface.\n    - gh-132969: Prevent the ProcessPoolExecutor executor thread,\n      which remains running when shutdown(wait=False), from\n      attempting to adjust the pool’s worker processes after\n      the object state has already been reset during shutdown.\n      A combination of conditions, including a worker process\n      having terminated abormally, resulted in an exception and\n      a potential hang when the still-running executor thread\n      attempted to replace dead workers within the pool.\n    - gh-130664: Support the '_' digit separator in formatting\n      of the integral part of Decimal’s. Patch by Sergey B\n      Kirpichev.\n    - gh-85702: If zoneinfo._common.load_tzdata is given a\n      package without a resource a ZoneInfoNotFoundError is\n      raised rather than a IsADirectoryError.\n    - gh-130664: Handle corner-case for Fraction’s formatting:\n      treat zero-padding (preceding the width field by a zero\n      ('0') character) as an equivalent to a fill character of\n      '0' with an alignment type of '=', just as in case of\n      float’s.\n  - Tools/Demos\n    - gh-135968: Stubs for strip are now provided as part of an\n      iOS install.\n  - Tests\n    - gh-135966: The iOS testbed now handles the app_packages\n      folder as a site directory.\n    - gh-135494: Fix regrtest to support excluding tests from\n      --pgo tests.
