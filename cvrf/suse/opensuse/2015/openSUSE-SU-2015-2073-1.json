      "Text": "\nDocker was updated to version 1.9.0, bringing features and bugfixes (bnc#954812):\n\n* Runtime:\n  - `docker stats` now returns block IO metrics (#15005)\n  - `docker stats` now details network stats per interface (#15786)\n  - Add `ancestor=\u003cimage\u003e` filter to `docker ps --filter` flag to filter\n    containers based on their ancestor images (#14570)\n  - Add `label=\u003csomelabel\u003e` filter to `docker ps --filter` to filter containers\n    based on label (#16530)\n  - Add `--kernel-memory` flag to `docker run` (#14006)\n  - Add `--message` flag to `docker import` allowing to specify an optional\n    message (#15711)\n  - Add `--privileged` flag to `docker exec` (#14113)\n  - Add `--stop-signal` flag to `docker run` allowing to replace the container\n    process stopping signal (#15307)\n  - Add a new `unless-stopped` restart policy (#15348)\n  - Inspecting an image now returns tags (#13185)\n  - Add container size information to `docker inspect` (#15796)\n  - Add `RepoTags` and `RepoDigests` field to `/images/{name:.*}/json` (#17275)\n  - Remove the deprecated `/container/ps` endpoint from the API (#15972)\n  - Send and document correct HTTP codes for `/exec/\u003cname\u003e/start` (#16250)\n  - Share shm and mqueue between containers sharing IPC namespace (#15862)\n  - Event stream now shows OOM status when `--oom-kill-disable` is set (#16235)\n  - Ensure special network files (/etc/hosts etc.) are read-only if bind-mounted\n    with `ro` option (#14965)\n  - Improve `rmi` performance (#16890)\n  - Do not update /etc/hosts for the default bridge network, except for links (#17325)\n  - Fix conflict with duplicate container names (#17389)\n  - Fix an issue with incorrect template execution in `docker inspect` (#17284)\n  - DEPRECATE `-c` short flag variant for `--cpu-shares` in docker run (#16271)\n* Client:\n  - Allow `docker import` to import from local files (#11907)\n* Builder:\n  - Add a `STOPSIGNAL` Dockerfile instruction allowing to set a different\n    stop-signal for the container process (#15307)\n  - Add an `ARG` Dockerfile instruction and a `--build-arg` flag to `docker build`\n    that allows to add build-time environment variables (#15182)\n  - Improve cache miss performance (#16890)\n* Storage:\n  - devicemapper: Implement deferred deletion capability (#16381)\n* Networking:\n  - `docker network` exits experimental and is part of standard release (#16645)\n  - New network top-level concept, with associated subcommands and API (#16645)\n    WARNING: the API is different from the experimental API\n  - Support for multiple isolated/micro-segmented networks (#16645)\n  - Built-in multihost networking using VXLAN based overlay driver (#14071)\n  - Support for third-party network plugins (#13424)\n  - Ability to dynamically connect containers to multiple networks (#16645)\n  - Support for user-defined IP address management via pluggable IPAM drivers (#16910)\n  - Add daemon flags `--cluster-store` and `--cluster-advertise` for built-in nodes discovery (#16229)\n  - Add `--cluster-store-opt` for setting up TLS settings (#16644)\n  - Add `--dns-opt` to the daemon (#16031)\n  - DEPRECATE following container `NetworkSettings` fields in API v1.21: `EndpointID`, `Gateway`,\n    `GlobalIPv6Address`, `GlobalIPv6PrefixLen`, `IPAddress`, `IPPrefixLen`, `IPv6Gateway` and `MacAddress`.\n    Those are now specific to the `bridge` network. Use `NetworkSettings.Networks` to inspect\n    the networking settings of a container per network.\n* Volumes:\n  - New top-level `volume` subcommand and API (#14242)\n  - Move API volume driver settings to host-specific config (#15798)\n  - Print an error message if volume name is not unique (#16009)\n  - Ensure volumes created from Dockerfiles always use the local volume driver\n    (#15507)\n  - DEPRECATE auto-creating missing host paths for bind mounts (#16349)\n* Logging:\n  - Add `awslogs` logging driver for Amazon CloudWatch (#15495)\n  - Add generic `tag` log option to allow customizing container/image\n    information passed to driver (e.g. show container names) (#15384)\n  - Implement the `docker logs` endpoint for the journald driver (#13707)\n  - DEPRECATE driver-specific log tags (e.g. `syslog-tag`, etc.) (#15384)\n* Distribution:\n  - `docker search` now works with partial names (#16509)\n  - Push optimization: avoid buffering to file (#15493)\n  - The daemon will display progress for images that were already being pulled\n    by another client (#15489)\n  - Only permissions required for the current action being performed are requested (#)\n  - Renaming trust keys (and respective environment variables) from `offline` to\n    `root` and `tagging` to `repository` (#16894)\n  - DEPRECATE trust key environment variables\n    `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_OFFLINE_PASSPHRASE` and\n    `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_TAGGING_PASSPHRASE` (#16894)\n* Security:\n  - Add SELinux profiles to the rpm package (#15832)\n  - Fix various issues with AppArmor profiles provided in the deb package\n    (#14609)\n  - Add AppArmor policy that prevents writing to /proc (#15571)\n\n* Change systemd unit file to no longer use the deprecated '-d' option (bnc#954737)\n\n- Also docker was updated to the 1.8.3 version that fixes security issues:\n  * Fix layer IDs lead to local graph poisoning (CVE-2014-8178) (bnc#949660)\n  * Fix manifest validation and parsing logic errors allow pull-by-digest validation bypass (CVE-2014-8179)\n  * Add `--disable-legacy-registry` to prevent a daemon from using a v1 registry\n",
