      "Text": "libXFont was updated to fix three vulnerabilities when parsing BDF files (bnc#921978)\n\nAs libXfont is used by the X server to read font files, and an unprivileged user with access to the X server can tell the X server to read a given font file from a path of their choosing, these vulnerabilities have the potential to allow unprivileged users to run code with the privileges of the X server.\n\nThe following vulnerabilities were fixed:\n* The BDF parser could allocate the a wrong buffer size, leading to out of bound writes (CVE-2015-1802)\n* The BDF parser could crash when trying to read an invalid pointer (CVE-2015-1803)\n* The BDF parser could read 32 bit metrics values into 16 bit integers, causing an out-of-bound memory access though integer overflow (CVE-2015-1804)",
