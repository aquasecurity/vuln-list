      "Text": "MozillaThunderbird was updated to fix 17 security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2015-4509: Use-after-free vulnerability in the HTMLVideoElement interface in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript code that modifies the URI table of a media element, aka ZDI-CAN-3176 (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4520: Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 allowed remote attackers to bypass CORS preflight protection mechanisms by leveraging (1) duplicate cache-key generation or (2) retrieval of a value from an incorrect HTTP Access-Control-* response header (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4521: The ConvertDialogOptions function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4522: The nsUnicodeToUTF8::GetMaxLength function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, related to an 'overflow (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4500: Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4511: Heap-based buffer overflow in the nestegg_track_codec_data function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted header in a WebM video (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7178: The ProgramBinary::linkAttributes function in libGLES in ANGLE, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 on Windows, mishandles shader access, which allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via crafted (1) OpenGL or (2) WebGL content (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7179: The VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace function in libGLES in ANGLE, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 on Windows, incorrectly allocates memory for shader attribute arrays, which allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via crafted (1) OpenGL or (2) WebGL content (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4506: Buffer overflow in the vp9_init_context_buffers function in libvpx, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3, allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted VP9 file (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4517: NetworkUtils.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4505: updater.exe in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 on Windows allowed local users to write to arbitrary files by conducting a junction attack and waiting for an update operation by the Mozilla Maintenance Service (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-4519: Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 allowed user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and discover a redirect's target URL via crafted JavaScript code that executes after a drag-and-drop action of an image into a TEXTBOX element (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7180: The ReadbackResultWriterD3D11::Run function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 misinterprets the return value of a function call, which might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7176: The AnimationThread function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 used an incorrect argument to the sscanf function, which might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7177: The InitTextures function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7174: The nsAttrAndChildArray::GrowBy function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, related to an 'overflow (bsc#947003).\n- CVE-2015-7175: The XULContentSinkImpl::AddText function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, related to an 'overflow (bsc#947003).\n  ",
