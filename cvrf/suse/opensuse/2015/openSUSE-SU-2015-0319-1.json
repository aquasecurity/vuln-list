      "Text": "perl-YAML-LibYAML was updated to version 0.59 to fix four security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2013-6393: The yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (bnc#860617, bnc#911782).\n- CVE-2012-1152: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the load_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load_mapping function, or (4) YAML sequence to the load_sequence function (bnc#751503).\n- CVE-2014-9130: scanner.c in LibYAML 0.1.5 and 0.1.6, as used in the YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module for Perl, allowed context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and crash) via vectors involving line-wrapping (bnc#907809, bnc#911782).\n- CVE-2014-2525: Heap-based buffer overflow in the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes function in LibYAML before 0.1.6 allowed context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URI in a YAML file (bnc#868944, bnc#911782).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n- PR/23 Better scalar dump heuristics\n- More closely match YAML.pm\n- Add a VERSION statement to YAML::LibYAML (issue#8)\n- Applied fix for PR/21. nawglan++\n- Use Swim cpan-tail block functions in doc\n- Get YAML::XS using latest libyaml\n- Fix for https://bitbucket.org/xi/libyaml/issue/10/wrapped-strings-cause-assert-failure\n- Fix e1 test failure on 5.21.4\n- Remove =travis section\n- Meta 0.0.2\n- Eliminate spurious trailing whitespace\n- Add t/000-compile-modules.t\n- Fix swim errors\n- Add badges to doc\n- Fix ReadMe\n- Fix Meta and add Contributing.\n- Doc fix. GitHub-Issue-#6. Thanks to Debian Perl Group for finding this.\n- Test::Base tests needed 'inc' in @INC\n- Switch to Zilla::Dist\n- No longer dep on Test::Base, Spiffy, and Filter::Util::Call\n- Remove test/changes.t\n- Removed another C++ // style comment. jdb++\n- Removed C++ // style comments, for better portability. jdb++\n- Using the latest libyaml codebase\n- https://github.com/yaml/libyaml/tree/perl-yaml-xs\n- Changes have been made to start moving libyaml to 1.2\n",
