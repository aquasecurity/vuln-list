      "Text": "This update of roundcubemail fixes one security issue and one bug.\n\n- roundcubemail was updated to disallow unwanted access on files in the file system.\n\n  The apache2 configuration file for roundcubemail previously allowed access to the\n  roundcubemail/bin folder and possibly /logs, /config and /temp, if these\n  were not symlinks (this is only the case when manually changed).\n\n  This update comes with a fixed configuration. If you modified the\n  file '/etc/apache2/conf.d/roundcubemail.conf', please replace it\n  with the configuration 'roundcubemail.conf.rpmnew' and reapply your\n  changes. After that, a restart of apache2 is requried.\n\n- This update also fixes an issue that causes apache2 not to start because\n  'mod_version.c' is not loaded.\n",
