      "Text": "php5 was updated to fix five security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2015-0231: Use-after-free vulnerability in the process_nested_data function in ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5 allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that leverages improper handling of duplicate numerical keys within the serialized properties of an object.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8142 (bnc#910659).\n- CVE-2015-0232: The exif_process_unicode function in ext/exif/exif.c in PHP before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5 allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer free and application crash) via crafted EXIF data in a JPEG image (bnc#914690).\n- CVE-2014-8142: Use-after-free vulnerability in the process_nested_data function in ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.36, 5.5.x before 5.5.20, and 5.6.x before 5.6.4 allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that leverages improper handling of duplicate keys within the serialized properties of an object, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1019 (bnc#910659).\n- CVE-2014-9427: sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through 5.4.36, 5.5.x through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap was used to read a .php file, did not properly consider the mapping's length during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks a newline character, which caused an out-of-bounds read and might (1) allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2) trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in memory locations adjacent to the mapping (bnc#911664).\n\nFor openSUSE 13.2 this additional security issue was fixed:\n- CVE-2014-9426: The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempted to perform a free operation on a stack-based character array, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors (bnc#911663).\n  ",
