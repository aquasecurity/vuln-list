      "Text": "privoxy was updated to version 3.0.23 to fix three security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect\nchunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled\n(the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort() (CVE-2015-1380).\n- Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the\npcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid\npcrs command is rejected as such (CVE-2015-1381).\n- Client requests with body that can't be delivered no longer\ncause pipelined requests behind them to be rejected as invalid (CVE-2015-1382).\n",
