      "Text": "dbus-1, dbus-1-x11 were updated to version 1.8.16 to fix one security issue.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n- CVE-2015-0245: Do not allow non-uid-0 processes to send forged\n  ActivationFailure messages. On Linux systems with systemd\n  activation, this would allow a local denial of service (bnc#916343).\n\nThese additional security hardenings are included:\n- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment from uids\n  other than the uid of the dbus-daemon. If a system service\n  installs unsafe security policy rules that allow arbitrary\n  method calls (such as CVE-2014-8148) then this prevents\n  memory consumption and possible privilege escalation via\n  UpdateActivationEnvironment.\n- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment or the\n  Stats interface on object paths other than\n  /org/freedesktop/DBus. Some system services install unsafe\n  security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls to\n  any destination, method and interface with a specified object\n  path.\n",
