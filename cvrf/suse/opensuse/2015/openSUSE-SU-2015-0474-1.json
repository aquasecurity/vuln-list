      "Text": "The SSH Terminal emulator putty was updated to the new upstream release 0.64, fixing security issues and bugs:\n\nSecurity fix:\nPuTTY no longer retains the private half of users' keys in memory by mistake after authenticating with them.\n[bsc#920167] (CVE-2015-2157)\n\nNew feature:\nSupport for SSH connection sharing, so that multiple instances of\nPuTTY to the same host can share a single SSH connection instead\nof all having to log in independently.\n\nBug fix:\nIPv6 literals are handled sensibly throughout the suite,\nif you enclose them in square brackets to prevent the colons\nbeing mistaken for a :port suffix.\n",
