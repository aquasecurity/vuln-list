      "Text": "\nOpenSSL was updated to fix various security issues.\n\nFollowing security issues were fixed:\n- CVE-2015-0209: A Use After Free following d2i_ECPrivatekey error\n  was fixed which could lead to crashes for attacker supplied Elliptic\n  Curve keys. This could be exploited over SSL connections with client\n  supplied keys.\n\n- CVE-2015-0286: A segmentation fault in ASN1_TYPE_cmp was fixed that\n  could be exploited by attackers when e.g. client authentication is\n  used. This could be exploited over SSL connections.\n\n- CVE-2015-0287: A ASN.1 structure reuse memory corruption was fixed. This\n  problem can not be exploited over regular SSL connections, only if\n  specific client programs use specific ASN.1 routines.\n\n- CVE-2015-0288: A X509_to_X509_REQ NULL pointer dereference was fixed,\n  which could lead to crashes. This function is not commonly used, and\n  not reachable over SSL methods.\n\n- CVE-2015-0289: Several PKCS7 NULL pointer dereferences were fixed,\n  which could lead to crashes of programs using the PKCS7 APIs. The SSL\n  apis do not use those by default.\n\n- CVE-2015-0293: Denial of service via reachable assert in SSLv2 servers,\n  could be used by remote attackers to terminate the server process. Note\n  that this requires SSLv2 being allowed, which is not the default.\n",
