      "Text": "roundcubemail was updated to version 1.0.7 to fix two security issues.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- XSS issue in drag-n-drop file uploads \n- Disallow unwanted access on files in the file system. The apache2 configuration file for roundcubemail allowed access to the roundcubemail/bin folder and possibly /logs, /config and /temp, if these were not symlinks (this was only the case when the configuration was manually changed) (bsc#952006)\n\nThe package comes with a fixed configuration. If you modified the file '/etc/apache2/conf.d/roundcubemail.conf', please replace it with the configuration 'roundcubemail.conf.rpmnew' and reapply your changes. After that, a restart of apache2 is requried.\n",
