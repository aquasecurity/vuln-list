WITH HOLD\n  and firing of deferred triggers within index expressions and\n  materialized view queries.\n* CVE-2020-25694, bsc#1178667:\n  a) Fix usage of complex connection-string parameters in pg_dump,\n  pg_restore, clusterdb, reindexdb, and vacuumdb.\n  b) When psql's \\connect command re-uses connection parameters,\n  ensure that all non-overridden parameters from a previous\n  connection string are re-used.\n* CVE-2020-25696, bsc#1178668: Prevent psql's \\gset command from\n  modifying specially-treated variables.\n* Fix recently-added timetz test case so it works when the USA\n  is not observing daylight savings time.\n  (obsoletes postgresql-timetz.patch)\n* https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2111/\n* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13-1.html\n\nInitial packaging of PostgreSQL 13:\n\n* https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2077/\n* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html\n\n- bsc#1178961: %ghost the symlinks to pg_config and ecpg.\n\nChanges in postgresql wrapper package:\n\n- Bump major version to 13.\n- We also transfer PostgreSQL 9.4.26 to the new package layout in\n  SLE12-SP2 and newer. Reflect this in the conflict with\n  postgresql94.\n- Also conflict with PostgreSQL versions before 9.\n- Conflicting with older versions is not limited to SLE.\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update update project.",
