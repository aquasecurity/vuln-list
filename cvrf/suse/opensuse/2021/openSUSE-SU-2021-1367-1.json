For more information,\n    see the Firefox 89 release notes.\n  - Firefox now supports logging into Microsoft, work, and\n    school accounts using Windows single sign-on. Learn more\n  - On Windows, updates can now be applied in the background\n    while Firefox is not running.\n  - Firefox for Windows now offers a new page about:third-party\n    to help identify compatibility issues caused by third-party\n    applications\n  - Version 2 of Firefox's SmartBlock feature further improves\n    private browsing. Third party Facebook scripts are blocked to\n    prevent you from being tracked, but are now automatically\n    loaded 'just in time' if you decide to 'Log in with Facebook'\n    on any website.\n  - Enhanced the privacy of the Firefox Browser's Private\n    Browsing mode with Total Cookie Protection, which confines\n    cookies to the site where they were created, preventing\n    companis from using cookies to track your browsing across\n    sites. This feature was originally launched in Firefox's ETP\n    Strict mode.\n  - PDF forms now support JavaScript embedded in PDF files.\n    Some PDF forms use JavaScript for validation and other\n    interactive features.\n  - You'll encounter less website breakage in Private Browsing\n    and Strict Enhanced Tracking Protection with SmartBlock,\n    which provides stand-in scripts so that websites load\n    properly.\n  - Improved Print functionality with a cleaner design and\n    better integration with your computer's printer settings.\n  - Firefox now protects you from supercookies, a type of\n    tracker that can stay hidden in your browser and track you\n    online, even after you clear cookies. By isolating\n    supercookies, Firefox prevents them from tracking your web\n    browsing from one site to the next.\n  - Firefox now remembers your preferred location for saved\n    bookmarks, displays the bookmarks toolbar by default on new\n    tabs, and gives you easy access to all of your bookmarks via\n    a toolbar folder.\n  - Native support for macOS devices built with Apple Silicon\n    CPUs brings dramatic performance improvements over the non-\n    native build that was shipped in Firefox 83: Firefox launches\n    over 2.5 times faster and web apps are now twice as\n    responsive (per the SpeedoMeter 2.0 test). If you are on a\n    new Apple device, follow these steps to upgrade to the latest\n    Firefox.\n  - Pinch zooming will now be supported for our users with\n    Windows touchscreen devices and touchpads on Mac devices.\n    Firefox users may now use pinch to zoom on touch-capable\n    devices to zoom in and out of webpages.\n  - We’ve improved functionality and design for a number of\n    Firefox search features:\n    * Selecting a search engine at the bottom of the search\n      panel now enters search mode for that engine, allowing you to\n      see suggestions (if available) for your search terms. The old\n      behavior (immediately performing a search) is available with\n      a shift-click.\n    * When Firefox autocompletes the URL of one of your search\n      engines, you can now search with that engine directly in the\n      address bar by selecting the shortcut in the address bar\n      results.\n    * We’ve added buttons at the bottom of the search panel to\n      allow you to search your bookmarks, open tabs, and history.\n  - Firefox supports AcroForm, which will allow you to fill in,\n    print, and save supported PDF forms and the PDF viewer also\n    has a new fresh look.\n  - For our users in the US and Canada, Firefox can now save,\n    manage, and auto-fill credit card information for you, making\n    shopping on Firefox ever more convenient.\n  - In addition to our default, dark and light themes, with\n    this release, Firefox introduces the Alpenglow theme: a\n    colorful appearance for buttons, menus, and windows. You can\n    update your Firefox themes under settings or preferences.\n* Changed: Firefox no longer supports Adobe Flash. There is no\n  setting available to re-enable Flash support.\n* Enterprise: Various bug fixes and new policies have been\n  implemented in the latest version of Firefox. See more\n  details in the Firefox for Enterprise 91 Release Notes.\n\n  MFSA 2021-33 (bsc#1188891):\n\n* CVE-2021-29986: Race condition when resolving DNS names could have led to\n  memory corruption\n* CVE-2021-29981: Live range splitting could have led to conflicting\n  assignments in the JIT\n* CVE-2021-29988: Memory corruption as a result of incorrect style treatment\n* CVE-2021-29983: Firefox for Android could get stuck in fullscreen mode\n* CVE-2021-29984: Incorrect instruction reordering during JIT optimization\n* CVE-2021-29980: Uninitialized memory in a canvas object could have led to\n  memory corruption\n* CVE-2021-29987: Users could have been tricked into accepting unwanted\n  permissions on Linux\n* CVE-2021-29985: Use-after-free media channels\n* CVE-2021-29982: Single bit data leak due to incorrect JIT optimization and\n  type confusion\n* CVE-2021-29989: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 91 and Firefox ESR 78.13\n* CVE-2021-29990: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 91\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.",

If tasks are allocated on the heap, this can cause double free and a memory leak. If not, this still can cause a logical bug. Crates using `Stealer::steal`, `Stealer::steal_batch`, or `Stealer::steal_batch_and_pop` are affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-deque 0.8.1 and 0.7.4.",
