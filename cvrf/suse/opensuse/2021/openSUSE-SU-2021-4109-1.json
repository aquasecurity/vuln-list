      "Text": "This update for logback fixes the following issues:\n\nUpgrade to version 1.2.8\n\n+ In response to log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228, all JNDI lookup code in logback\n  has been disabled until further notice. This impacts\n  ContextJNDISelector and insertFromJNDI element in\n  configuration files.\n+ Also in response to log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228, all database (JDBC) related\n  code in the project has been removed with no replacement.\n+ Note that the vulnerability mentioned in LOGBACK-1591 requires\n  write access to logback's configuration file as a\n  prerequisite. The log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228 and LOGBACK-1591\n  are of different severity levels. A successful RCE requires\n  all of the following conditions to be met:\n  - write access to logback.xml\n  - use of versions lower then 1.2.8\n  - reloading of poisoned configuration data, which implies\n    application restart or scan='true' set prior to attack\n",

      "CVE": "CVE-2021-44228",
      "Description": "Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.",
