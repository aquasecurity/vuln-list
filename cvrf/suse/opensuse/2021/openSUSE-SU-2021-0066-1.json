      "Text": "This update for nodejs14 fixes the following issues:\n\n- New upstream LTS version 14.15.4:\n  * CVE-2020-8265: use-after-free in TLSWrap (High) bug in TLS\n    implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket,\n    node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with\n    a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument.\n    If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is\n    passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure.\n    This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a\n    Denial of Service or potentially other exploits (bsc#1180553)\n  * CVE-2020-8287: HTTP Request Smuggling allow two copies of a\n    header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding\n    header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header\n    field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request\n    Smuggling (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/444.html).\n    (bsc#1180554)\n\n- New upstream LTS version 14.15.3:\n  * deps:\n    + upgrade npm to 6.14.9\n    + update acorn to v8.0.4\n  * http2: check write not scheduled in scope destructor\n  * stream: fix regression on duplex end\n\n- New upstream LTS version 14.15.1:\n  * deps: Denial of Service through DNS request (High).\n  A Node.js application that allows an attacker to trigger a DNS\n  request for a host of their choice could trigger a Denial of Service\n  by getting the application to resolve a DNS record with\n  a larger number of responses (bsc#1178882, CVE-2020-8277)\n\nThis update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update update project.",
