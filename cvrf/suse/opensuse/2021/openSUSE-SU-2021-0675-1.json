      "Text": "This update for alpine fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to release 2.24\n\n* A few crash fixes\n* Implementation of XOAUTH2 for Yahoo! Mail.\n\nUpdate to release 2.23.2\n\n* Expansion of the configuration screen for XOAUTH2 to include\n  username, and tenant.\n* Alpine uses the domain in the From: header of a message\n  to generate a message-id and suppresses all information\n  about Alpine, version, revision, and time of generation\n  of the message-id from this header.\n* Alpine does not generate Sender or X-X-Sender by default by\n  enabling [X] Disable Sender as the default.\n* Alpine does not disclose User Agent by default by enabling\n  [X] Suppress User Agent by default.\n* When messages are selected, pressing the ';' command to\n  broaden or narrow a search, now offers the possibility to\n  completely replace the search, and is almost equivalent to\n  being a shortcut to 'unselect all messages, and select\n  again'.\n\nUpdate to release 2.23\n\n* Fixes boo#1173281, CVE-2020-14929: Alpine silently proceeds to\n  use an insecure connection after a /tls is sent in certain\n  circumstances.\n* Implementation of XOAUTH2 authentication support for Outlook.\n* Add support for the OAUTHBEARER authentication method in Gmail.\n* Support for the SASL-IR IMAP extension.\n* Alpine can pass an HTML message to an external web browser,\n  by using the 'External' command in the ATTACHMENT INDEX\n  screen.\n\nUpdate to release 2.22\n\n* Support for XOAUTH2 authentication method in Gmail. \n* NTLM authentication support with the ntlm library.\n* Added the '/tls1_3' flag for servers that support it.\n* Add the 'g' option to the select command that works in IMAP\n  servers that implement the X-GM-EXT-1 capability (such as the\n  one offered by Gmail).\n* Added '/auth=XYZ' to the way to define a server. This allows\n  users to select the method to authenticate to an IMAP, SMTP\n  or POP3 server. Examples are /auth=plain, or /auth=gssapi,\n  etc.\n* When a message is of type multipart/mixed, and its first part\n  is multipart/signed, Alpine will include the text of the\n  original message in a reply message, instead of including a\n  multipart attachment.\n* Added backward search in the index screen.\n* pico: Add -dict option to Pico, which allows users to choose a\n  dictionary when spelling.\n- Drop /usr/bin/mailutil, it is not built by default anymore.\n\n* Added Quota subcommands for printing, forwarding, saving, etc.\n",
