Note that\n  this results in a breaking change in the 'fingerprints'\n  dictionary format.\n* Updated OpenSSH 8.1 (and earlier) policies to include\n  rsa-sha2-512 and rsa-sha2-256.\n* Added OpenSSH v8.6 \u0026 v8.7 policies.\n* Added 3 new key exchanges:\n\n  + gss-gex-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==\n  + gss-group1-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==\n  + gss-group14-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==\n* Added 3 new MACs:\n\n  + hmac-ripemd160-96\n  + AEAD_AES_128_GCM\n  + AEAD_AES_256_GCM\n\nUpdate to version 2.4.0\n\n* Added multi-threaded scanning support.\n* Added version check for OpenSSH user enumeration (CVE-2018-15473).\n* Added deprecation note to host key types based on SHA-1.\n* Added extra warnings for SSHv1.\n* Added built-in hardened OpenSSH v8.5 policy.\n* Upgraded warnings to failures for host key types based on SHA-1\n* Fixed crash when receiving unexpected response during host key\n  test.\n* Fixed hang against older Cisco devices during host key test \u0026\n  gex test.\n* Fixed improper termination while scanning multiple targets when\n  one target returns an error.\n* Dropped support for Python 3.5 (which reached EOL in Sept.2020)\n* Added 1 new key exchange: sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com.\n\n",
