      "Text": "This update for privoxy fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to version 3.0.32:\n\n  - Security/Reliability (boo#1183129)\n\n    - ssplit(): Remove an assertion that could be triggered with a\n      crafted CGI request.\n      Commit 2256d7b4d67. OVE-20210203-0001. CVE-2021-20272\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - cgi_send_banner(): Overrule invalid image types. Prevents a\n      crash with a crafted CGI request if Privoxy is toggled off.\n      Commit e711c505c48. OVE-20210206-0001. CVE-2021-20273\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - socks5_connect(): Don't try to send credentials when none are\n      configured. Fixes a crash due to a NULL-pointer dereference\n      when the socks server misbehaves.\n      Commit 85817cc55b9. OVE-20210207-0001. CVE-2021-20274\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - chunked_body_is_complete(): Prevent an invalid read of size\n      two.\n      Commit a912ba7bc9c. OVE-20210205-0001. CVE-2021-20275\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - Obsolete pcre: Prevent invalid memory accesses with an invalid\n      pattern passed to pcre_compile(). Note that the obsolete pcre\n      code is scheduled to be removed before the 3.0.33 release.\n      There has been a warning since 2008 already.\n      Commit 28512e5b624. OVE-20210222-0001. CVE-2021-20276\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n\n  - Bug fixes:\n\n    - Properly parse the client-tag-lifetime directive. Previously it was\n      not accepted as an obsolete hash value was being used.\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - decompress_iob(): Prevent reading of uninitialized data.\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera).\n    - decompress_iob(): Don't advance cur past eod when looking\n      for the end of the file name and comment.\n    - decompress_iob(): Cast value to unsigned char before shifting.\n      Prevents a left-shift of a negative value which is undefined behaviour.\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - gif_deanimate(): Confirm that that we have enough data before doing\n      any work. Fixes a crash when fuzzing with an empty document.\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera).\n    - buf_copy(): Fail if there's no data to write or nothing to do.\n      Prevents undefined behaviour 'applying zero offset to null pointer'.\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)\n    - log_error(): Treat LOG_LEVEL_FATAL as fatal even when --stfu is\n      being used while fuzzing.\n      Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera).\n    - Respect DESTDIR when considering whether or not to install\n      config files with '.new' extension.\n    - OpenSSL ssl_store_cert(): Fix two error messages.\n    - Fix a couple of format specifiers.\n    - Silence compiler warnings when compiling with NDEBUG.\n    - fuzz_server_header(): Fix compiler warning.\n    - fuzz_client_header(): Fix compiler warning.\n    - cgi_send_user_manual(): Also reject requests if the user-manual\n      directive specifies a https:// URL. Previously Privoxy would try and\n      fail to open a local file.\n\n  - General improvements:\n\n    - Log the TLS version and the the cipher when debug 2 is enabled.\n    - ssl_send_certificate_error(): Respect HEAD requests by not sending a body.\n    - ssl_send_certificate_error(): End the body with a single new line.\n    - serve(): Increase the chances that the host is logged when closing\n      a server socket.\n    - handle_established_connection(): Add parentheses to clarify an expression\n      Suggested by: David Binderman\n    - continue_https_chat(): Explicitly unset CSP_FLAG_CLIENT_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE\n      if process_encrypted_request() fails. This makes it more obvious that the\n      connection will not be reused. Previously serve() relied on\n      CSP_FLAG_SERVER_CONTENT_LENGTH_SET and CSP_FLAG_CHUNKED being unset.\n      Inspired by a patch from Joshua Rogers (Opera).\n    - decompress_iob(): Add periods to a couple of log messages\n    - Terminate the body of the HTTP snipplets with a single new line\n      instead of '\\r\\n'.\n    - configure: Add --with-assertions option and only enable assertions\n      when it is used\n    - windows build: Use --with-brotli and --with-mbedtls by default and\n      enable dynamic error checking.\n    - gif_deanimate(): Confirm we've got an image before trying to write it\n      Saves a pointless buf_copy() call.\n    - OpenSSL ssl_store_cert(): Remove a superfluous space before the serial number.\n\n  - Action file improvements:\n\n    - Disable fast-redirects for .golem.de/\n    - Unblock requests to adri*.\n    - Block requests for trc*.taboola.com/\n    - Disable fast-redirects for .linkedin.com/\n\n  - Filter file improvements:\n\n    - Make the second pcrs job of the img-reorder filter greedy again.\n      The ungreedy version broke the img tags on:\n      https://bulk.fefe.de/scalability/.\n\n  - Privoxy-Log-Parser:\n\n    - Highlight a few more messages.\n    - Clarify the --statistics output. The shown 'Reused connections'\n      are server connections so name them appropriately.\n    - Bump version to 0.9.3.\n\n  - Privoxy-Regression-Test:\n\n    - Add the --check-bad-ssl option to the --help output.\n    - Bump version to 0.7.3.\n\n  - Documentation:\n\n    - Add pushing the created tag to the release steps in the developer manual.\n    - Clarify that 'debug 32768' should be used in addition to the other debug\n      directives when reporting problems.\n    - Add a 'Third-party licenses and copyrights' section to the user manual.\n\nThis update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.2:Update update project.",
