CVE-2019-10214.patch\n\nChanges in podman:\n\nUpdate to v2.2.1\n\n* Changes\n\n  - Due to a conflict with a previously-removed field, we were forced to\n    modify the way image volumes (mounting images into containers using\n    --mount type=image) were handled in the database.\n    As a result, containers created in Podman 2.2.0 with image volume\n     will not have them in v2.2.1, and these containers will need to be re-created.\n\n* Bugfixes\n\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would, on systems without the\n    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment variable defined, use an incorrect path\n    for the PID file of the Podman pause process, causing Podman to fail\n    to start (#8539).\n  - Fixed a bug where containers created using Podman v1.7 and earlier were\n    unusable in Podman due to JSON decode errors (#8613).\n  - Fixed a bug where Podman could retrieve invalid cgroup paths, instead\n    of erroring, for containers that were not running.\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman system reset command would print a warning\n    about a duplicate shutdown handler being registered.\n  - Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to mount sysfs in\n    circumstances where it was not allowed; some OCI runtimes (notably\n    crun) would fall back to alternatives and not fail, but others\n    (notably runc) would fail to run containers.\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman run and podman create commands would fail\n    to create containers from untagged images (#8558).\n  - Fixed a bug where remote Podman would prompt for a password even when\n    the server did not support password authentication (#8498).\n  - Fixed a bug where the podman exec command did not move the Conmon\n    process for the exec session into the correct cgroup.\n  - Fixed a bug where shell completion for the ancestor option to\n    podman ps --filter did not work correctly.\n  - Fixed a bug where detached containers would not properly clean themselves\n    up (or remove themselves if --rm was set) if the Podman command that\n    created them was invoked with --log-level=debug.\n\n* API\n\n  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not\n    properly handle the Binds and Mounts parameters in HostConfig.\n  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers\n    ignored the Name query parameter.\n  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Create endpoint for Containers did not\n    properly handle the 'default' value for NetworkMode (this value is\n    used extensively by docker-compose) (#8544).\n  - Fixed a bug where the Compat Build endpoint for Images would sometimes\n    incorrectly use the target query parameter as the image's tag.\n\n* Misc\n\n  - Podman v2.2.0 vendored a non-released, custom version of the\n    github.com/spf13/cobra package; this has been reverted to the latest\n    upstream release to aid in packaging.\n  - Updated the containers/image library to v5.9.0\n\nUpdate to v2.2.0\n\n* Features\n\n - Experimental support for shortname aliasing has been added. This is not enabled by default, but can be turned on by setting the environment variable CONTAINERS_SHORT_NAME_ALIASING to on. Documentation is available here and here.\n - Initial support has been added for the podman network connect and podman network disconnect commands, which allow existing containers to modify what networks they are connected to. At present, these commands can only be used on running containers that did not specify --network=none when they were created.\n - The podman run command now supports the --network-alias option to set network aliases (additional names the container can be accessed at from other containers via DNS if the dnsname CNI plugin is in use). Aliases can also be added and removed using the new podman network connect and podman network disconnect commands. Please note that this requires a new release (v1.1.0) of the dnsname plugin, and will only work on newly-created CNI networks.\n - The podman generate kube command now features support for exporting container's memory and CPU limits (#7855).\n - The podman play kube command now features support for setting CPU and Memory limits for containers (#7742).\n - The podman play kube command now supports persistent volumes claims using Podman named volumes.\n - The podman play kube command now supports Kubernetes configmaps via the --configmap option (#7567).\n - The podman play kube command now supports a --log-driver option to set the log driver for created containers.\n - The podman play kube command now supports a --start option, enabled by default, to start the pod after creating it. This allows for podman play kube to be more easily used in systemd unitfiles.\n - The podman network create command now supports the --ipv6 option to enable dual-stack IPv6 networking for created networks (#7302).\n - The podman inspect command can now inspect pods, networks, and volumes, in addition to containers and images (#6757).\n - The --mount option for podman run and podman create now supports a new type, image, to mount the contents of an image into the container at a given location.\n - The Bash and ZSH completions have been completely reworked and have received significant enhancements! Additionally, support for Fish completions and completions for the podman-remote executable have been added.\n - The --log-opt option for podman create and podman run now supports the max-size option to set the maximum size for a container's logs (#7434).\n - The --network option to the podman pod create command now allows pods to be configured to use slirp4netns networking, even when run as root (#6097).\n - The podman pod stop, podman pod pause, podman pod unpause, and podman pod kill commands now work on multiple containers in parallel and should be significantly faster.\n - The podman search command now supports a --list-tags option to list all available tags for a single image in a single repository.\n - The podman search command can now output JSON using the --format=json option.\n - The podman diff and podman mount commands now work with all containers in the storage library, including those not created by Podman. This allows them to be used with Buildah and CRI-O containers.\n - The podman container exists command now features a --external option to check if a container exists not just in Podman, but also in the storage library. This will allow Podman to identify Buildah and CRI-O containers.\n - The --tls-verify and --authfile options have been enabled for use with remote Podman.\n - The /etc/hosts file now includes the container's name and hostname (both pointing to localhost) when the container is run with --net=none (#8095).\n - The podman events command now supports filtering events based on the labels of the container they occurred on using the --filter label=key=value option.\n - The podman volume ls command now supports filtering volumes based on their labels using the --filter label=key=value option.\n - The --volume and --mount options to podman run and podman create now support two new mount propagation options, unbindable and runbindable.\n - The name and id filters for podman pod ps now match based on a regular expression, instead of requiring an exact match.\n - The podman pod ps command now supports a new filter status, that matches pods in a certain state.\n* Changes\n - The podman network rm --force command will now also remove pods that are using the network (#7791).\n - The podman volume rm, podman network rm, and podman pod rm commands now return exit code 1 if the object specified for removal does not exist, and exit code 2 if the object is in use and the --force option was not given.\n - If /dev/fuse is passed into Podman containers as a device, Podman will open it before starting the container to ensure that the kernel module is loaded on the host and the device is usable in the container.\n - Global Podman options that were not supported with remote operation have been removed from podman-remote (e.g. --cgroup-manager, --storage-driver).\n - Many errors have been changed to remove repetition and be more clear as to what has gone wrong.\n - The --storage option to podman rm is now enabled by default, with slightly changed semantics. If the given container does not exist in Podman but does exist in the storage library, it will be removed even without the --storage option. If the container exists in Podman it will be removed normally. The --storage option for podman rm is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n - The --storage option to podman ps has been renamed to --external. An alias has been added so the old form of the option will continue to work.\n - Podman now delays the SIGTERM and SIGINT signals during container creation to ensure that Podman is not stopped midway through creating a container resulting in potential resource leakage (#7941).\n - The podman save command now strips signatures from images it is exporting, as the formats we export to do not support signatures (#7659).\n - A new Degraded state has been added to pods. Pods that have some, but not all, of their containers running are now considered to be Degraded instead of Running.\n - Podman will now print a warning when conflicting network options related to port forwarding (e.g. --publish and --net=host) are specified when creating a container.\n - The --restart on-failure and --rm options for containers no longer conflict. When both are specified, the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero error code, and removed if it exits cleanly (#7906).\n - Remote Podman will no longer use settings from the client's containers.conf; defaults will instead be provided by the server's containers.conf (#7657).\n -
