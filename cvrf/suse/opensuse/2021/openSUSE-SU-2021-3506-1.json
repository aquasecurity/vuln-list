      "Text": "This update for containerd, docker, runc fixes the following issues:\n\nDocker was updated to 20.10.9-ce. (bsc#1191355)\n\nSee upstream changelog in the packaged\n  /usr/share/doc/packages/docker/CHANGELOG.md. \n\n  CVE-2021-41092 CVE-2021-41089 CVE-2021-41091 CVE-2021-41103\n\ncontainer was updated to v1.4.11, to fix CVE-2021-41103. bsc#1191355\n\n- CVE-2021-32760: Fixed that a archive package allows chmod of file outside of unpack target directory (bsc#1188282)\n\n- Install systemd service file as well (bsc#1190826)\n\nUpdate to runc v1.0.2. Upstream changelog is available from\n\n  https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.2\n\n* Fixed a failure to set CPU quota period in some cases on cgroup v1.\n* Fixed the inability to start a container with the 'adding seccomp filter\n  rule for syscall ...' error, caused by redundant seccomp rules (i.e. those\n  that has action equal to the default one). Such redundant rules are now\n  skipped.\n* Made release builds reproducible from now on.\n* Fixed a rare debug log race in runc init, which can result in occasional\n  harmful 'failed to decode ...' errors from runc run or exec.\n* Fixed the check in cgroup v1 systemd manager if a container needs to be\n  frozen before Set, and add a setting to skip such freeze unconditionally.\n  The previous fix for that issue, done in runc 1.0.1, was not working.\n\nUpdate to runc v1.0.1. Upstream changelog is available from\n\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.1\n\n* Fixed occasional runc exec/run failure ('interrupted system call') on an\n  Azure volume.\n* Fixed 'unable to find groups ... token too long' error with /etc/group\n  containing lines longer than 64K characters.\n* cgroup/systemd/v1: fix leaving cgroup frozen after Set if a parent cgroup is\n  frozen. This is a regression in 1.0.0, not affecting runc itself but some\n  of libcontainer users (e.g Kubernetes).\n* cgroupv2: bpf: Ignore inaccessible existing programs in case of\n  permission error when handling replacement of existing bpf cgroup\n  programs. This fixes a regression in 1.0.0, where some SELinux\n  policies would block runc from being able to run entirely.\n* cgroup/systemd/v2: don't freeze cgroup on Set.\n* cgroup/systemd/v1: avoid unnecessary freeze on Set.\n- fix issues with runc under openSUSE MicroOS's SELinux policy. bsc#1187704\n\nUpdate to runc v1.0.0. Upstream changelog is available from\n\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n\n! The usage of relative paths for mountpoints will now produce a warning\n  (such configurations are outside of the spec, and in future runc will\n  produce an error when given such configurations).\n* cgroupv2: devices: rework the filter generation to produce consistent\n  results with cgroupv1, and always clobber any existing eBPF\n  program(s) to fix runc update and avoid leaking eBPF programs\n  (resulting in errors when managing containers).\n* cgroupv2: correctly convert 'number of IOs' statistics in a\n  cgroupv1-compatible way.\n* cgroupv2: support larger than 32-bit IO statistics on 32-bit architectures.\n* cgroupv2: wait for freeze to finish before returning from the freezing\n  code, optimize the method for checking whether a cgroup is frozen.\n* cgroups/systemd: fixed 'retry on dbus disconnect' logic introduced in rc94\n* cgroups/systemd: fixed returning 'unit already exists' error from a systemd\n  cgroup manager (regression in rc94)\n+ cgroupv2: support SkipDevices with systemd driver\n+ cgroup/systemd: return, not ignore, stop unit error from Destroy\n+ Make 'runc --version' output sane even when built with go get or\n  otherwise outside of our build scripts.\n+ cgroups: set SkipDevices during runc update (so we don't modify\n  cgroups at all during runc update).\n+ cgroup1: blkio: support BFQ weights.\n+ cgroupv2: set per-device io weights if BFQ IO scheduler is available.\n\nUpdate to runc v1.0.0~rc95. Upstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95\n\nThis release of runc contains a fix for CVE-2021-30465, and users are\nstrongly recommended to update (especially if you are providing\nsemi-limited access to spawn containers to untrusted users). (bsc#1185405)\n\nUpdate to runc v1.0.0~rc94. Upstream changelog is available from https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc94\n\nBreaking Changes:\n* cgroupv1: kernel memory limits are now always ignored, as kmemcg has\n  been effectively deprecated by the kernel. Users should make use of regular\n  memory cgroup controls.\n\nRegression Fixes:\n\n* seccomp: fix 32-bit compilation errors\n* runc init: fix a hang caused by deadlock in seccomp/ebpf loading code\n* runc start: fix 'chdir to cwd: permission denied' for some setups\n",

A bug was found in containerd versions prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host’s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with specific files.",

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories with insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files.

      "Description": "Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime. A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry. This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that any configured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.",

      "Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability. A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories.",
