      "Text": "This update for git fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate from version 2.26.2 to version 2.31.1 (jsc#SLE-18152)\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n- CVE-2021-21300: On case-insensitive file systems with support for symbolic links, if Git is configured globally \n  to apply delay-capable clean/smudge filters (such as Git LFS), Git could run remote code during a clone. (bsc#1183026)\n\nNon security changes:\n\n- Add `sysusers` file to create `git-daemon` user.\n- Remove `perl-base` and `openssh-server` dependency on `git-core`and provide a `perl-Git` package. (jsc#SLE-17838)\n- `fsmonitor` bug fixes\n- Fix `git bisect` to take an annotated tag as a good/bad endpoint\n- Fix a corner case in `git mv` on case insensitive systems\n- Require only `openssh-clients` where possible (like Tumbleweed or SUSE Linux Enterprise \u003e= 15 SP3). (bsc#1183580)\n- Drop `rsync` requirement, not necessary anymore.\n- Use of `pack-redundant` command is discouraged and will trigger a warning. The replacement is `repack -d`.\n- The `--format=%(trailers)` mechanism gets enhanced to make it easier to design output for machine consumption.\n- No longer give message to choose between rebase or merge upon pull if the history `fast-forwards`.\n- The configuration variable `core.abbrev` can be set to `no` to force no abbreviation regardless of the hash algorithm\n- `git rev-parse` can be explicitly told to give output as absolute or relative path with the \n  `--path-format=(absolute|relative)` option.\n- Bash completion update to make it easier for end-users to add completion for their custom `git` subcommands.\n- `git maintenance` learned to drive scheduled maintenance on platforms whose native scheduling methods are not 'cron'.\n- After expiring a reflog and making a single commit, the reflog for the branch would record a single entry that \n  knows both `@{0}` and `@{1}`, but we failed to answer 'what commit were we on?', i.e. `@{1}`\n- `git bundle` learns `--stdin` option to read its refs from the standard input.  \n  Also, it now does not lose refs when they point at the same object.\n- `git log` learned a new `--diff-merges=\u003chow\u003e` option.\n- `git ls-files` can and does show multiple entries when the index is unmerged, which is a source for confusion \n  unless `-s/-u` option is in use.  A new option `--deduplicate` has been introduced.\n- `git worktree list` now annotates worktrees as prunable, shows locked and prunable attributes \n  in `--porcelain mode`, and gained a `--verbose` option.\n- `git clone` tries to locally check out the branch pointed at by HEAD of the remote repository after it \n  is done, but the protocol did not convey the information necessary to do so when copying an empty repository.  \n  The protocol v2 learned how to do so.\n- There are other ways than `..` for a single token to denote a `commit range', namely `\u003crev\u003e^!` \n   and `\u003crev\u003e^-\u003cn\u003e`, but `git range-diff` did not understand them.\n- The `git range-diff` command learned `--(left|right)-only` option to show only one side of the compared range.\n- `git mergetool` feeds three versions (base, local and remote) of a conflicted path unmodified. \n  The command learned to optionally prepare these files with unconflicted parts already resolved.\n- The `.mailmap` is documented to be read only from the root level of a working tree, but a stray file \n  in a bare repository also was read by accident, which has been corrected.\n- `git maintenance` tool learned a new `pack-refs` maintenance task.\n- Improved error message given when a configuration variable that is expected to have a boolean value.\n- Signed commits and tags now allow verification of objects, whose two object names \n  (one in SHA-1, the other in SHA-256) are both signed.\n- `git rev-list` command learned `--disk-usage` option.\n- `git diff`, `git log` `--{skip,rotate}-to=\u003cpath\u003e` allows the user to discard diff output for early \n  paths or move them to the end of the output.\n- `git difftool` learned `--skip-to=\u003cpath\u003e` option to restart an interrupted session from an arbitrary path.\n- `git grep` has been tweaked to be limited to the sparse checkout paths.\n- `git rebase --[no-]fork-point` gained a configuration variable `rebase.forkPoint` so that users do not have \n  to keep specifying a non-default setting.\n- `git stash` did not work well in a sparsely checked out working tree.\n- Newline characters in the host and path part of `git://` URL are now forbidden.\n- `Userdiff` updates for PHP, Rust, CSS\n- Avoid administrator error leading to data loss with `git push --force-with-lease[=\u003cref\u003e]` by \n  introducing `--force-if-includes`\n- only pull `asciidoctor` for the default ruby version\n- The `--committer-date-is-author-date` option of `rebase` and `am` subcommands lost the e-mail address by \n  mistake in 2.29\n- The transport protocol v2 has become the default again\n- `git worktree` gained a `repair` subcommand, `git init --separate-git-dir` no longer corrupts administrative data \n  related to linked worktrees\n- `git maintenance` introduced for repository maintenance tasks\n- `fetch.writeCommitGraph` is deemed to be still a bit too risky and is no longer part of the \n  `feature.experimental` set.\n- The commands in the `diff` family honors the `diff.relative` configuration variable.\n- `git diff-files` has been taught to say paths that are marked as `intent-to-add` are new files, \n  not modified from an empty blob.\n- `git gui` now allows opening work trees from the start-up dialog.\n- `git bugreport` reports what shell is in use.\n- Some repositories have commits that record wrong committer timezone; `git fast-import` has an option to pass \n  these timestamps intact to allow recreating existing repositories as-is.\n- `git describe` will always use the `long` version when giving its output based misplaced tags \n- `git pull` issues a warning message until the `pull.rebase` configuration variable is explicitly given\n  ",

      "CVE": "CVE-2021-21300",
      "Description": "Git is an open-source distributed revision control system. In affected versions of Git a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and macOS). Note that clean/smudge filters have to be configured for that. Git for Windows configures Git LFS by default, and is therefore vulnerable. The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021. As a workaound, if symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. Likewise, if no clean/smudge filters such as Git LFS are configured globally (i.e. _before_ cloning), the attack is foiled. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources. The earliest impacted version is 2.14.2. The fix versions are: 2.30.1, 2.29.3, 2.28.1, 2.27.1, 2.26.3, 2.25.5, 2.24.4, 2.23.4, 2.22.5, 2.21.4, 2.20.5, 2.19.6, 2.18.5, 2.17.62.17.6.",
