      "Text": "This update for ssh-audit fixes the following issues:\n\nssh-audit was updated to version 2.5.0\n\n* Fixed crash when running host key tests.\n* Handles server connection failures more gracefully.\n* Now prints JSON with indents when -jj is used (useful for\n  debugging).\n* Added MD5 fingerprints to verbose output.\n* Added -d/--debug option for getting debugging output.\n* Updated JSON output to include MD5 fingerprints. Note that\n  this results in a breaking change in the 'fingerprints'\n  dictionary format.\n* Updated OpenSSH 8.1 (and earlier) policies to include\n  rsa-sha2-512 and rsa-sha2-256.\n* Added OpenSSH v8.6 \u0026 v8.7 policies.\n* Added 3 new key exchanges:\n\n  + gss-gex-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==\n  + gss-group1-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==\n  + gss-group14-sha1-eipGX3TCiQSrx573bT1o1Q==\n* Added 3 new MACs:\n\n  + hmac-ripemd160-96\n  + AEAD_AES_128_GCM\n  + AEAD_AES_256_GCM\n\nUpdate to version 2.4.0\n\n* Added multi-threaded scanning support.\n* Added version check for OpenSSH user enumeration (CVE-2018-15473).\n* Added deprecation note to host key types based on SHA-1.\n* Added extra warnings for SSHv1.\n* Added built-in hardened OpenSSH v8.5 policy.\n* Upgraded warnings to failures for host key types based on SHA-1\n* Fixed crash when receiving unexpected response during host key\n  test.\n* Fixed hang against older Cisco devices during host key test \u0026\n  gex test.\n* Fixed improper termination while scanning multiple targets when\n  one target returns an error.\n* Dropped support for Python 3.5 (which reached EOL in Sept.2020)\n* Added 1 new key exchange: sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com.\n\nUpdate to version 2.3.1\n\n* Now parses public key sizes for\n  rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com and\n  rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com host key types.\n* Flag ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com as a failure due to SHA-1\n  hash.\n* Fixed bug in recommendation output which suppressed some\n  algorithms inappropriately.\n* Built-in policies now include CA key requirements (if\n  certificates are in use).\n* Lookup function (--lookup) now performs case-insensitive\n  lookups of similar algorithms.\n* Migrated pre-made policies from external files to internal\n  database.\n* Split single 3,500 line script into many files (by class).\n* Added setup.py support\n* Added 1 new cipher: des-cbc@ssh.com.\n\nUpdate to version 2.3.0\n\nThe highlight of this release is support for policy scanning\n(this allows an admin to test a server against a\nhardened/standard configuration).\n\n* Added new policy auditing functionality to test adherence to\n  a hardening guide/standard configuration\n  (see -L/--list-policies, -M/--make-policy and -P/--policy).\n* Created new man page (see ssh-audit.1 file).\n* 1024-bit moduli upgraded from warnings to failures.\n* Many Python 2 code clean-ups, testing framework improvements,\n  pylint \u0026 flake8 fixes, and mypy type comments.\n* Added feature to look up algorithms in internal database\n  (see --lookup)\n* Suppress recommendation of token host key types.\n* Added check for use-after-free vulnerability in PuTTY v0.73.\n* Added 11 new host key types: ssh-rsa1, ssh-dss-sha256@ssh.com,\n  ssh-gost2001, ssh-gost2012-256, ssh-gost2012-512,\n  spki-sign-rsa, ssh-ed448, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,\n  x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, x509v3-ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,\n  x509v3-rsa2048-sha256.\n* Added 8 new key exchanges: diffie-hellman-group1-sha256,\n  kexAlgoCurve25519SHA256, Curve25519SHA256, gss-group14-sha256-,\n  gss-group15-sha512-, gss-group16-sha512-, gss-nistp256-sha256-,\n  gss-curve25519-sha256-.\n* Added 5 new ciphers: blowfish, AEAD_AES_128_GCM,\n  AEAD_AES_256_GCM, crypticore128@ssh.com, seed-cbc@ssh.com.\n* Added 3 new MACs: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com, hmac-sha3-224,\n  crypticore-mac@ssh.com.\n- Update ssh-audit.keyring\n",
