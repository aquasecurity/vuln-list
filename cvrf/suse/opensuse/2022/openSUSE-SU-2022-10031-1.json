      "Text": "This update for wdiff fixes the following issues:\n\nThis update ships wdiff.\n\nUpdated to 1.2.2:\n\n  * Updated Vietnamese, Swedish, Estonian, Chinese (traditional),\n    Brazilian Portuguese and Russian translations.\n  * Updated gnulib.\n  * Used more recent autotools: autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.14.1.\n\nupdated to 1.2.1:\n\n  * Added Esperanto translation.\n  * Updated Czech, German, Spanish, Finnish, Galician, Italian, Dutch,\n    Polish, Slovenian, Serbian, Swedish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese\n    translations.\n  * Updated gnulib.\n  * Recreated build system using recent versions of autotools.\n    This will avoid security issues in 'make distcheck' target.\n    (CVE-2012-3386)\n\nupdated to 1.1.2:\n\n  * Backport gnulib change to deal with removal of gets function.\n    This is a build-time-only fix. (Mentioned in Fedora bug #821791)\n  * Added Serbian translation.\n  * Updated Danish and Vietnamese translations.\n  * Work around a bug in the formatting of the man page.\n    (Debian bug #669340)\n  * Updated Czech, German, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, Polish, Slovenian,\n    Swedish and Ukrainian translations.\n  * Fix several issue with the use of screen in the test suite.\n  * Allow WDIFF_PAGER to override PAGER environment variable.\n  * Do not autodetect less, so we don't auto-enable less-mode.\n    This should improve things for UTF8 text. (Savannah bug #34224)\n    Less-mode is considered deprecated, as it isn't fit for multi-byte\n    encodings. Nevertheless it can still be enabled on the command line.\n  * Introduces use of ngettext to allow correct handling of plural forms\n\nupdated to 1.0.1:\n\n  * Updated Polish, Ukrainian, Slovenian, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish and\n    Czech translations\n  * Changed major version to 1 to reflect maturity of the package\n  * Updated Dutch, French, Danish and Slovenian translations\n  * Added Ukrainian translation\n  * Improved error reporting in case a child process has problems\n  * Added tests to the test suite\n  * Updated gnulib\n\nupdated to 0.6.5:\n\n  * Never initialize or deinitialize terminals, as we do no cursor \n    movement\n  * Deprecated --no-init-term (-K) command line option\n  * Avoid relative path in man pages\n  * Updated gnulib, might be particularly important for uClibc \n    users\n\nupdated to 0.6.4:\n\n  * Updated Catalan translations\n  * Updated gnulib\n\nupdate to 0.6.3:\n\n  * `wdiff -d' to read input from single unified diff, perhaps stdin.\n  * Updated texinfo documentation taking experimental switch into account.\n  * Experimental programs (mdiff \u0026 friends) and a configure switch\n    --enable-experimental to control them.\n  * Recent imports from gnulib, use of recent autotools.\n  * Improved autodetection of termcap library like ncurses.\n  * Reformatted translations, still a number of fuzzy translations.\n  * Changed from CVS to bzr for source code version control.\n  * Various bug fixes. See ChangeLog for a more exhaustive list.\n  * Introduce --with-default-pager=PAGER configure switch.\n  * Fix missing newline in info dir entry list.\n  * Fix shell syntax in configure script\n  * Updated gnulib and gettext, the latter to 0.18\n  * Updated Dutch translation\n  * Fixed a number of portability issues reported by maint.mk syntax checks\n  * Updated Italian and Swedish translations\n  * Updated gnulib\n",
