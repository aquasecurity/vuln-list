      "Text": "This update for tor fixes the following issues:\n\ntor 0.4.7.11:\n\n  * Improve security of DNS cache by randomly clipping the TTL\n    value (boo#1205307, TROVE-2021-009)\n  * Improved defenses against network-wide DoS, multiple counters\n    and metrics added to MetricsPorts\n  * Apply circuit creation anti-DoS defenses if the outbound\n    circuit max cell queue size is reached too many times. This\n    introduces two new consensus parameters to control the queue\n    size limit and number of times allowed to go over that limit.\n  * Directory authority updates\n  * IPFire database and geoip updates\n  * Bump the maximum amount of CPU that can be used from 16 to 128.\n    The NumCPUs torrc option overrides this hardcoded maximum.\n  * onion service: set a higher circuit build timeout for opened\n    client rendezvous circuit to avoid timeouts and retry load\n  * Make the service retry a rendezvous if the circuit is being\n    repurposed for measurements\n",
