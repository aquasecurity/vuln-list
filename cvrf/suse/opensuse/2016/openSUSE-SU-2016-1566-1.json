      "Text": "This update for nodejs to version 4.4.5 fixes the several issues.\n\nThese security issues introduced by the bundled openssl were fixed by going to version 1.0.2h:\n- CVE-2016-2107: The AES-NI implementation in OpenSSL did not consider memory allocation during a certain padding check, which allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information via a padding-oracle attack against an AES CBC session (bsc#977616).\n- CVE-2016-2105: Integer overflow in the EVP_EncodeUpdate function in crypto/evp/encode.c in OpenSSL allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a large amount of binary data (bsc#977614).\n- CVE-2016-0705: Double free vulnerability in the dsa_priv_decode function in crypto/dsa/dsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed DSA private key (bsc#968047).\n- CVE-2016-0797: Multiple integer overflows in OpenSSL allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption or NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long digit string that is mishandled by the (1) BN_dec2bn or (2) BN_hex2bn function, related to crypto/bn/bn.h and crypto/bn/bn_print.c (bsc#968048).\n- CVE-2016-0702: The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in OpenSSL did not properly consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which made it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a 'CacheBleed' attack (bsc#968050).\n\nThese non-security issues were fixed:\n- Fix faulty 'if' condition (string cannot equal a boolean).\n- buffer: Buffer no longer errors if you call lastIndexOf with a search term longer than the buffer.\n- contextify: Context objects are now properly garbage collected, this solves a problem some individuals were experiencing with extreme memory growth.\n- Update npm to 2.15.5.\n- http: Invalid status codes can no longer be sent. Limited to 3 digit numbers between 100 - 999.\n- deps: Fix --gdbjit for embedders. Backported from v8 upstream.\n- querystring: Restore throw when attempting to stringify bad surrogate pair.\n- https: Under certain conditions SSL sockets may have been causing a memory leak when keepalive is enabled. This is no longer the case.\n- lib: The way that we were internally passing arguments was causing a potential leak. By copying the arguments into an array we can avoid this.\n- repl: Previously if you were using the repl in strict mode the column number would be wrong in a stack trace. This is no longer an issue.\n- deps: An update to v8 that introduces a new flag --perf_basic_prof_only_functions.\n- http: A new feature in http(s) agent that catches errors on keep alived connections.\n- src: Better support for big-endian systems.\n- tls: A new feature that allows you to pass common SSL options to tls.createSecurePair.\n- build: Support python path that includes spaces.\n- https: A potential fix for #3692 (HTTP/HTTPS client requests throwing EPROTO).\n- installer: More readable profiling information from isolate tick logs.\n- process: Add support for symbols in event emitters (symbols didn't exist when it was written).\n- querystring: querystring.parse() is now 13-22% faster!\n- streams: Performance improvements for moving small buffers that shows a 5% throughput gain. IoT projects have been seen to be as much as 10% faster with this change!\n",
