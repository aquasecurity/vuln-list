      "Text": "\nThis update for python-Jinja2 fixes the following issues:\n\nUpdate to version 2.8:\n- Added `target` parameter to urlize function.\n- Added support for `followsymlinks` to the file system loader.\n- The truncate filter now counts the length.\n- Added equalto filter that helps with select filters.\n- Changed cache keys to use absolute file names if available\n  instead of load names.\n- Fixed loop length calculation for some iterators.\n- Changed how Jinja2 enforces strings to be native strings in\n    Python 2 to work when people break their default encoding.\n- Added :func:`make_logging_undefined` which returns an undefined\n    object that logs failures into a logger.\n- If unmarshalling of cached data fails the template will be\n    reloaded now.\n- Implemented a block ``set`` tag.\n- Default cache size was incrased to 400 from a low 50.\n- Fixed ``is number`` test to accept long integers in all Python versions.\n- Changed ``is number`` to accept Decimal as a number.\n- Added a check for default arguments followed by non-default arguments. This\n    change makes ``{% macro m(x, y=1, z) %}...{% endmacro %}`` a syntax error. The\n    previous behavior for this code was broken anyway (resulting in the default\n    value being applied to `y`).\n- Add ability to use custom subclasses of ``jinja2.compiler.CodeGenerator`` and\n    ``jinja2.runtime.Context`` by adding two new attributes to the environment\n    (`code_generator_class` and `context_class`) (pull request ``#404``).\n- added support for context/environment/evalctx decorator functions on\n    the finalize callback of the environment.\n- escape query strings for urlencode properly.  Previously slashes were not\n    escaped in that place.\n- Add 'base' parameter to 'int' filter.\n\n- Update to 2.7.3 (boo#858239, CVE-2014-0012)\n",
