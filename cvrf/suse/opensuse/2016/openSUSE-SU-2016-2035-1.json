      "Text": "\nThis update for pcre2 fixes the following issues:\n\n- pcre2 10.22:\n  * The POSIX wrapper function regcomp() did not used to\n    support back references and subroutine calls if called with the\n    REG_NOSUB option. It now does.\n  * A new function, pcre2_code_copy(), is added, to make a copy of a\n    compiled pattern.\n  * Support for string callouts is added to pcre2grep.\n  * Added the PCRE2_NO_JIT option to pcre2_match().\n  * The pcre2_get_error_message() function now returns with a\n    negative error code if the error number it is given is unknown.\n  * Several updates have been made to pcre2test and test scripts\n  * Fix CVE-2016-3191: workspace overflow for (*ACCEPT) with deeply\n                       nested parentheses (boo#971741)\n\n- Update to new upstream release 10.21\n* Improve JIT matching speed of patterns starting with + or *.\n* Use memchr() to find the first character in an unanchored match\n  in 8-bit mode in the interpreter. This gives a significant speed\n  improvement.\n* 10.20 broke the handling of [[:\u003e:]] and [[:\u003c:]] in that\n  processing them could involve a buffer overflow if the\n  following character was an opening parenthesis.\n* 10.20 also introduced a bug in processing this pattern:\n  /((?x)(*:0))#(?'/, which was fixed.\n* A callout with a string argument containing an opening square\n  bracket, for example /(?C$[$)(?\u003c]/, was incorrectly processed and\n  could provoke a buffer overflow.\n* A possessively repeated conditional group that could match an empty\n  string, for example, /(?(R))*+/, was incorrectly compiled.\n* The Unicode tables have been updated to Unicode 8.0.0.\n* An empty comment (?#) in a pattern was incorrectly processed and\n  could provoke a buffer overflow.\n* Fix infinite recursion in the JIT compiler when certain patterns\n  /such as (?:|a|){100}x/ are analysed.\n* Some patterns with character classes involving [: and \\\\ were\n  incorrectly compiled and could cause reading from uninitialized\n  memory or an incorrect error diagnosis. Examples are:\n  /[[:\\\\](?\u003c[::]/ and /[[:\\\\](?'abc')[a:].\n* A missing closing parenthesis for a callout with a string argument\n  was not being diagnosed, possibly leading to a buffer overflow.\n* If (?R was followed by - or + incorrect behaviour happened instead\n  of a diagnostic.\n* Fixed an issue when \\p{Any} inside an xclass did not read the current\n  character.\n* About 80 more fixes, which you can read about in the ChangeLog\n  shipped with the libpcre2-8-0 package.\n",
