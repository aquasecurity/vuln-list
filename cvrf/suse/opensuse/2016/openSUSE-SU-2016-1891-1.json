      "Text": "This update for dropbear fixes four security issues (bnc#990363):\n\n- A format string injection vulnerability allowed remotes attacker to run arbitrary code as root if specific usernames including '%' symbols could be created on the target system. If a dbclient user can control usernames or host arguments, or untrusted input is processed,  potentially arbitrary code could have been executed as the dbclient user.\n- When importing malicious OpenSSH key files via dropbearconvert, arbitrary code could have been executed as the local dropbearconvert user\n- If particular -m or -c arguments were provided, as used in scripts, dbclient could have executed arbitrary code\n- dbclient or dropbear server could have exposed process memory to the running user if compiled with DEBUG_TRACE and running with -v\n\nDropbear was updated to the upstream 2016.74 release, including fixes for the following upstream issues:\n\n- Port forwarding failure when connecting to domains that have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n- 100% CPU use while waiting for rekey to complete\n- Fix crash when fallback initshells() is used\n  scp failing when the local user doesn't exist\n\nThe following upstream improvements are included:\n\n- Support syslog in dbclient, option -o usesyslog=yes\n- Kill a proxycommand when dbclient exits\n- Option to exit when a TCP forward fails\n- Allow specifying commands eg 'dropbearmulti dbclient ...' instead of symlinks\n",
