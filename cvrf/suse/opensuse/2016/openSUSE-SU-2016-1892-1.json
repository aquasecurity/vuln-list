      "Text": "\nThis mbedtls update to version 1.3.17 fixes the following issues: \n\nSecurity issues fixed:\n- Fix missing padding length check in \n  mbedtls_rsa_rsaes_pkcs1_v15_decrypt required by PKCS1 v2.2\n- Fix a potential integer underflow to buffer overread in \n  mbedtls_rsa_rsaes_oaep_decrypt. It is not triggerable \n  remotely in SSL/TLS.\n- Fix potential integer overflow to buffer overflow in \n  mbedtls_rsa_rsaes_pkcs1_v15_encrypt and \n  mbedtls_rsa_rsaes_oaep_encrypt\n\nBugs fixed:\n- Fix bug in mbedtls_mpi_add_mpi() that caused wrong results \n  when the three arguments where the same (in-place doubling). \n  Found and fixed by Janos Follath. #309\n- Fix issue in Makefile that prevented building using armar.\n- Fix issue that caused a hang up when generating RSA keys of \n  odd bitlength\n- Fix bug in mbedtls_rsa_rsaes_pkcs1_v15_encrypt that made \n  null pointer dereference possible.\n- Fix issue that caused a crash if invalid curves were passed \n  to mbedtls_ssl_conf_curves. #373\n\nFurther changes:\n- On ARM platforms, when compiling with -O0 with GCC, Clang or \n  armcc5, don't use the optimized assembly for bignum \n  multiplication. This removes the need to pass \n  -fomit-frame-pointer to avoid a build error with -O0.\n- Disabled SSLv3 in the default configuration.\n- Fix non-compliance server extension handling. Extensions for \n  SSLv3 are now ignored, as required by RFC6101.\n",
