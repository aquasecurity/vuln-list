 "Description": "The product uses a non-blocking model that relies on a single threaded process\n\t\t\tfor features such as scalability, but it contains code that can block when it is invoked.",

 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "When an attacker can directly invoke the blocking code, or the blocking code can be affected by environmental conditions that can be influenced by an attacker, then this can lead to a denial of service by causing unexpected hang or freeze of the code. Examples of blocking code might be an expensive computation or calling\n\t\t\t\tblocking library calls, such as those that perform exclusive file operations or require a successful network operation.",
  "Due to limitations in multi-thread models, single-threaded\n\t\t\t\tmodels are used to overcome the resource constraints that are caused by using\n\t\t\t\tmany threads. In such a model, all code should generally be\n\t\t\t\tnon-blocking. If blocking code is called, then the event loop will\n\t\t\t\teffectively be stopped, which can be undesirable or dangerous.  Such\n\t\t\t\tmodels are used in Python asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js, or other\n\t\t\t\tcustom event loop code."
