 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "The operating conditions of hardware may change\n              in ways that cause unexpected behavior to occur,\n              including the skipping of security-critical CPU\n              instructions. Generally, this can occur due to\n              electrical disturbances or when the device operates\n              outside of its expected conditions.",
  "In practice, application code may contain\n\t\t\t  conditional branches that are security-sensitive (e.g.,\n\t\t\t  accepting or rejecting a user-provided password). These\n\t\t\t  conditional branches are typically implemented by a\n\t\t\t  single conditional branch instruction in the program\n\t\t\t  binary which, if skipped, may lead to effectively\n\t\t\t  flipping the branch condition - i.e., causing the wrong\n\t\t\t  security-sensitive branch to be taken. This affects\n\t\t\t  processes such as firmware authentication, password\n\t\t\t  verification, and other security-sensitive decision\n\t\t\t  points.",
  "Attackers can use fault injection techniques to\n\t\t\t  alter the operating conditions of hardware so that\n\t\t\t  security-critical instructions are skipped more\n\t\t\t  frequently or more reliably than they would in a\n\t\t\t  \"natural\" setting."
