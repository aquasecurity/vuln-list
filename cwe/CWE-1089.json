  "This issue can make the product perform more slowly.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.",
  "While the interpretation of \"large data table\" and \"excessively large number of indices\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default threshold of 1000000 rows for a \"large\" table and a default threshold of 3 indices."
