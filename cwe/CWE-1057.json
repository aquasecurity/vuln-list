 },
 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "This issue can make the product perform more slowly than intended, since the intended central data manager may have been explicitly optimized for performance or other quality characteristics.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability."
