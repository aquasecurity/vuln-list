  "This issue can make the product perform more slowly.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.",
  "While the interpretation of \"large data table\" and \"excessive index range\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a threshold of 1000000 table rows and a threshold of 10 for the index range."
