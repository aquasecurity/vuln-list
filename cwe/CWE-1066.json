 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. by triggering an exception.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.",
  "As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java."
