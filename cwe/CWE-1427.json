 "Description": "The product uses externally-provided data to build prompts provided to\nlarge language models (LLMs), but the way these prompts are constructed\ncauses the LLM to fail to distinguish between user-supplied inputs and\ndeveloper provided system directives.",
 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "\n\t\t\t    When prompts are constructed using externally controllable data, it is\noften possible to cause an LLM to ignore the original guidance provided by\nits creators (known as the \"system prompt\") by inserting malicious\ninstructions in plain human language or using bypasses such as special\ncharacters or tags. Because LLMs are designed to treat all instructions as\nlegitimate, there is often no way for the model to differentiate between\nwhat prompt language is malicious when it performs inference and returns\ndata. Many LLM systems incorporate data from other adjacent products or\nexternal data sources like Wikipedia using API calls and retrieval\naugmented generation (RAG). Any external sources in use that may contain\nuntrusted data should also be considered potentially malicious. \n\t\t\t  "
