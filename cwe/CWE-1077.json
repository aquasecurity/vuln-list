 "Name": "Floating Point Comparison with Incorrect Operator",
 "Description": "The code performs a comparison such as an\n        equality test between two float (floating point) values, but\n        it uses comparison operators that do not account for the\n        possibility of loss of precision.",

 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Numeric calculation using floating point values\n\t   can generate imprecise results because of rounding errors.\n\t   As a result, two different calculations might generate\n\t   numbers that are mathematically equal, but have slightly\n\t   different bit representations that do not translate to the\n\t   same mathematically-equal values.  As a result, an equality\n\t   test or other comparison might produce unexpected\n\t   results.",
  "This issue can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
