 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "For example, in PHP, extraction can be used to provide functionality similar to register_globals, a dangerous functionality that is frequently disabled in production systems. Calling extract() or import_request_variables() without the proper arguments could allow arbitrary global variables to be overwritten, including superglobals.",
  "Similar functionality is possible in other interpreted languages, including custom languages."
