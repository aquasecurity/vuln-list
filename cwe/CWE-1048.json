  "While the interpretation of \"excessively large Fan-Out value\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 referenced objects.",
  "This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.  It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
