     "Different cipher\n\t\t\t    modes have different requirements for\n\t\t\t    their IVs. When choosing and implementing\n\t\t\t    a mode, it is important to understand\n\t\t\t    those requirements in order to keep\n\t\t\t    security guarantees intact. Generally, it\n\t\t\t    is safest to generate a random IV, since\n\t\t\t    it will be both unpredictable and have a\n\t\t\t    very low chance of being non-unique. IVs\n\t\t\t    do not have to be kept secret, so if\n\t\t\t    generating duplicate IVs is a concern, a\n\t\t\t    list of already-used IVs can be kept and\n\t\t\t    checked against.\n\t\t\t    ",
     "\n\t\t\t      NIST offers recommendations on generation of IVs for modes of which they have approved. These include options for when random IVs are not practical. For CBC, CFB, and OFB, see [REF-1175]; for GCM, see [REF-1178].\n\t\t\t    "
