 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Before powering down, the Intellectual\n                Property (IP) saves current state (S) to persistent\n                storage such as flash or always-on memory in order to\n                optimize the restore operation.  During this process,\n                an attacker with access to the persistent storage may\n                alter (S) to a configuration that could potentially\n                modify privileges, disable protections, and/or cause\n                damage to the hardware. If the IP does not validate\n                the configuration state stored in persistent memory,\n                upon regaining power or becoming operational again,\n                the IP could be compromised through the activation of\n                an unwanted/harmful configuration.\n                "
