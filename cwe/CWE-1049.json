  "This issue can make the product perform more slowly.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.",
  "While the interpretation of \"large data table\" and \"large number of joins or sub-queries\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 1 million rows for a \"large\" data table, a default minimum of 5 joins, and a default minimum of 3 sub-queries."
