 "Description": "The device does not contain sufficient protection\n\tmechanisms to prevent physical side channels from exposing\n\tsensitive information due to patterns in physically observable\n\tphenomena such as variations in power consumption,\n\telectromagnetic emissions (EME), or acoustic emissions.",

  "An adversary could monitor and measure physical\n\t  phenomena to detect patterns and make inferences, even if it\n\t  is not possible to extract the information in the digital\n\t  domain.",
  "Physical side channels have been well-studied for\n\t  decades in the context of breaking implementations of\n\t  cryptographic algorithms or other attacks against security\n\t  features. These side channels may be easily observed by an\n\t  adversary with physical access to the device, or using a\n\t  tool that is in close proximity.  If the adversary can\n\t  monitor hardware operation and correlate its data processing\n\t  with power, EME, and acoustic measurements, the adversary\n\t  might be able to recover of secret keys and data."
