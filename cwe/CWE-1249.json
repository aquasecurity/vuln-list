 "Description": "The product provides an application for administrators to manage parts of the underlying operating system, but the application does not accurately identify all of the relevant entities or resources that exist in the OS; that is, the application's model of the OS's state is inconsistent with the OS's actual state.",
 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Many products provide web-based applications or other interfaces for managing the underlying operating system. This is common with cloud, network access devices, home networking, and other systems.  When the management tool does not accurately represent what is in the OS - such as user accounts - then the administrator might not see suspicious activities that would be noticed otherwise.",
  "For example, numerous systems utilize a web\n\t\t\t\tfront-end for administrative control. They also offer\n\t\t\t\tthe ability to add, alter, and drop users with various\n\t\t\t\tprivileges as it relates to the functionality of the\n\t\t\t\tsystem.  A potential architectural weakness may exist\n\t\t\t\twhere the user information reflected in the web\n\t\t\t\tinterface does not mirror the users in the underlying\n\t\t\t\toperating system.  Many web UI or REST APIs use the\n\t\t\t\tunderlying operating system for authentication; the\n\t\t\t\tsystem's logic may also track an additional set of\n\t\t\t\tuser capabilities within configuration files\n\t\t\t\tand datasets for authorization capabilities. When\n\t\t\t\tthere is a discrepancy between the user information in\n\t\t\t\tthe UI or REST API's interface system and the\n\t\t\t\tunderlying operating system's user listing, this may\n\t\t\t\tintroduce a weakness into the system.  For example, if an\n\t\t\t\tattacker compromises the OS and adds a new user\n\t\t\t\taccount - a \"ghost\" account - then the attacker could escape detection if\n\t\t\t\tthe management tool does not list the newly-added\n\t\t\t\taccount.",
  "This discrepancy could be exploited in several ways:",
  "\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n                    ",
  "Many of these attacker scenarios can be\n\t\t\t\trealized by leveraging separate vulnerabilities\n\t\t\t\trelated to XSS, command injection, authentication\n\t\t\t\tbypass, or logic flaws on the various systems.\n\t\t\t\t"
