 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "\n\t   After initial reset, System-on-Chip (SoC) fabric access controls and other\n           security features need to be programmed by trusted firmware as part\n           of the boot sequence. If untrusted IPs or peripheral microcontrollers\n\t   are enabled first, then the untrusted component can master\n           transactions on the hardware bus and target memory or other assets to\n           compromise the SoC boot firmware."
