 },
 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "This issue can make the product perform more slowly, as connection pools allow connections to be reused without the overhead and time consumption of opening and closing a new connection.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability."
