 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "When the product has a data access component, the design may be intended to handle all data access operations through that component.  If a data access operation is performed outside of that component, then this may indicate a violation of the intended design.",
  "This issue can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
