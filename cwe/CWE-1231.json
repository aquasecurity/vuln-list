 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "In integrated circuits and hardware\n\t\t\t  intellectual property (IP) cores, device configuration\n\t\t\t  controls are commonly programmed after a device power\n\t\t\t  reset by a trusted firmware or software module (e.g.,\n\t\t\t  BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further\n\t\t\t  modification.",
  "This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit. \n\t\t\t  When set, the lock bit disables writes to a protected set of\n\t\t\t  registers or address regions. Design or coding errors in\n\t\t\t  the implementation of the lock bit protection feature\n\t\t\t  may allow the lock bit to be modified or cleared by\n\t\t\t  software after it has been set. Attackers might be able to unlock the system and\n\t\t\t  features that the bit is intended to protect."
