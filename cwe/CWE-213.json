  "When handling information, the developer must consider whether the information is regarded as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users or administrators.  Each stakeholder effectively has its own intended security policy that the product is expected to uphold.  When a developer does not treat that information as sensitive, this can introduce a vulnerability that violates the expectations of the product's users."
