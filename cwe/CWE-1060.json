 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "This issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.",
  "While the interpretation of \"too many data queries\" may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 5 data queries for an inefficient function/procedure."
