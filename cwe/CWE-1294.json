 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Systems-On-Chip (Integrated circuits and hardware\n                    engines) implement Security Identifiers to\n                    differentiate/identify actions originated from various\n                    agents. These actions could be 'read', 'write', 'program',\n                    'reset', 'fetch', 'compute', etc. Security identifiers are\n                    generated and assigned to every agent in the System (SoC)\n                    that is either capable of generating an action or receiving\n                    an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned\n                    a unique, Security Identifier based on its trust level or\n                    privileges.",
  "A broad class of flaws can exist in the Security\n                    Identifier process, including but not limited to missing\n                    security identifiers, improper conversion of security\n                    identifiers, incorrect generation of security identifiers,\n                    etc."
