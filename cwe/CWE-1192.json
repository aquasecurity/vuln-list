 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "A System-on-Chip (SoC) comprises several components (IP) with varied\n           trust requirements. It is required that each IP is identified\n           uniquely and should distinguish itself from other entities in\n           the SoC without any ambiguity. The unique secured identity is\n           required for various purposes. Most of the time the identity is used\n           to route a transaction or perform certain actions, including \n           resetting, retrieving a sensitive information, and acting upon or on\n           behalf of something else.",
