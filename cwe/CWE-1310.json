 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "A System or System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements a boot process utilizing security mechanisms such as Root-of-Trust (RoT) typically starts by executing code from a Read-only-Memory (ROM) component. The code in ROM is immutable, hence any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for the systems that are already in use.",
  "A common weakness is that the ROM does not have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the system gets shipped.  This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary can compromise the SoC."
