 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "DMA is included in a number of devices because it allows\n              data transfer between the computer and the connected device, using\n              direct hardware access to read or write directly to main memory\n              without any OS interaction. An attacker could exploit this to\n              access secrets. Several virtualization-based mitigations have been introduced to thwart DMA attacks. These are usually\n              configured/setup during boot time. However, certain IPs that are\n              powered up before boot is complete (known as early boot IPs) may\n              be DMA capable. Such IPs, if not trusted, could launch DMA\n              attacks and gain access to assets that should otherwise be\n              protected."
