 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "The power consumed by a device may be instrumented and monitored in real time. If the algorithm for evaluating security tokens is not sufficiently robust, the power consumption may vary by token entry comparison against the reference value. Further, if retries are unlimited, the power difference between a \"good\" entry and a \"bad\" entry may be observed and used to determine whether each entry itself is correct thereby allowing unauthorized parties to calculate the reference value."
