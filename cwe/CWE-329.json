 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "CBC mode eliminates a weakness of Electronic Code\n\t   Book (ECB) mode by allowing identical plaintext blocks to\n\t   be encrypted to different ciphertext blocks. This is\n\t   possible by the XOR-ing of an IV with the initial plaintext\n\t   block so that every plaintext block in the chain is XOR'd\n\t   with a different value before encryption. If IVs are\n\t   reused, then identical plaintexts would be encrypted to\n\t   identical ciphertexts. However, even if IVs are not\n\t   identical but are predictable, then they still break the\n\t   security of CBC mode against Chosen Plaintext Attacks\n\t   (CPA)."
