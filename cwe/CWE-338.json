 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.",
  "Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography."
