  "Description": "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to 7.18.0 and 6.23.0, the number of links in the decompression chain is unbounded and the default maxHeaderSize allows a malicious server to insert thousands compression steps leading to high CPU usage and excessive memory allocation. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.18.0 and 6.23.0.",
