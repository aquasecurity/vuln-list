  "Description": "The Curl_input_negotiate function in http_negotiate.c in libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.21.6, as used in curl and other products, always performs credential delegation during GSSAPI authentication, which allows remote servers to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Richard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl unconditionally performs credential delegation, handing the server a copy of the client's security credential. (CVE-2011-2192)",
