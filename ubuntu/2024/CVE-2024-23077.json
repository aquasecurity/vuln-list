  "Description": "JFreeChart v1.5.4 was discovered to be vulnerable to ArrayIndexOutOfBounds via the component /chart/plot/CompassPlot.java. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.",
