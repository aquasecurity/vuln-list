  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. The django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend.authenticate() method allows remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack involving login requests for users with an unusable password.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e upstream advises that only versions 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1 (plus main development branch) are affected but it is likely earlier versions may also be affected but upstream do not mention this as they are no longer maintained by them"
