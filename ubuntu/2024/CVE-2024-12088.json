  "Description": "A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links` option, the rsync client fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination sent from the server contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the desired directory.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e Affected function unsafe_symlink() is in rsync in all Ubuntu releases so assuming all are affected since this function hasn't changed upstream in the last 16 years"
