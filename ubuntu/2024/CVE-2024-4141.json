  "Description": "Out-of-bounds array write in Xpdf 4.05 and earlier, triggered by an invalid character code in a Type 1 font. The root problem was a bounds check that was being optimized away by modern compilers.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e In trusty to bionic, xpdf is built with poppler as the backend",
    "mdeslaur\u003e library, so most xpdf issues don't apply to it. In jammy and",
    "mdeslaur\u003e later, the xpdf package is actually xpopple, a fork that also",
    "mdeslaur\u003e builds against poppler."
