  "Description": "When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far missing. Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but are not limited to - - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the same page (4k on x86), - - INTx lines.",
