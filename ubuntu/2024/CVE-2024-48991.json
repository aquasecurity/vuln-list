  "Description": "Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root by winning a race condition and tricking needrestart into running their own, fake Python interpreter (instead of the system's real Python interpreter). The initial security fix (6ce6136) introduced a regression which was subsequently resolved (42af5d3).",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "eslerm| The security fix 6ce6136 (\"core: prevent race condition on",
    "eslerm| /proc/$PID/exec evaluation\") introduces regressions. See upstream",
    "eslerm| issue #317. As of 2024-11-21, no regression fix exists.",
    "sudhackar| See USN-7117-2 for the regression fix."
