  "Description": "Apfloat v1.10.1 was discovered to contain an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException via the component org.apfloat.internal.DoubleCRTMath::add(double[], double[]). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability. The submission may have been based on a tool that is not sufficiently robust for vulnerability identification.",
