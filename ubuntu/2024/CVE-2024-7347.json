  "Description": "NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus have a vulnerability in the ngx_http_mp4_module, which might allow an attacker to over-read NGINX worker memory resulting in its termination, using a specially crafted mp4 file. The issue only affects NGINX if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module and the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Additionally, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger the processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.Â  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e In Focal and Jammy, the vulnerable module is in the nginx-extras",
