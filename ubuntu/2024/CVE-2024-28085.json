  "Description": "wall in util-linux through 2.40, often installed with setgid tty permissions, allows escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals through argv. (Specifically, escape sequences received from stdin are blocked, but escape sequences received from argv are not blocked.) There may be plausible scenarios where this leads to account takeover.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e USN-6719-1 added patches, but it turned out they were",
    "mdeslaur\u003e insufficient to completely fix the issue, so -2 was released",
    "mdeslaur\u003e which removes the setgid bit from the wall and write binaries."
