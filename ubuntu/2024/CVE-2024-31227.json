  "Description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An authenticated with sufficient privileges may create a malformed ACL selector which, when accessed, triggers a server panic and subsequent denial of service. The problem exists in Redis 7 prior to versions 7.2.6 and 7.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
