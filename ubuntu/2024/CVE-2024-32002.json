  "Description": "Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.",

    "leosilva\u003e This issue exploits case insensitivity. As in Linux Ext4 has an option to turn on",
    "leosilva\u003e case insensitivity Linux could be a target.",
    "leosilva\u003e This issue was not reproducible, but fixed in all releases but Focal, Bionic",
    "leosilva\u003e and xenial, where source",
    "leosilva\u003e is not backportable in a first glance. Pending further investigation."
