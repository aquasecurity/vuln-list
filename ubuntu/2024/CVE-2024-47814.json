  "Description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A use-after-free was found in Vim \u003c 9.1.0764. When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
