  "Description": "fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism, and thus unexpected actions might be authorized by \"auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so\" for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because they believe issue resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to restrict pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention mechanism, not modifying pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.",

  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e This isn't really a vulnerability in fprintd, it's a limitation",

    "mdeslaur\u003e mailing list discussion, this CVE was disputed. Marking as",
