  "Description": "A security regression (CVE-2006-5051) was discovered in OpenSSH's server (sshd). There is a race condition which can lead sshd to handle some signals in an unsafe manner. An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to trigger it by failing to authenticate within a set time period.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled signal management. A remote attacker could use this issue to bypass authentication and remotely access systems without proper credentials.",
  "Notes": [
    "seth-arnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.",
    "sbeattie\u003e introduced in upstream commit 752250caa (\"upstream: revised log infrastructure for OpenSSH\", 2020-10-16) (v8.5p1)",
    "sbeattie\u003e essentially a regression of CVE-2006-5051",
    "sbeattie\u003e Because of a quirk of the 24.04/noble patch to allow systemd socket activation, it is believed that that release is not vulnerable to the exploitation approach taken by Qualys. https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/tree/debian/patches/systemd-socket-activation.patch"
