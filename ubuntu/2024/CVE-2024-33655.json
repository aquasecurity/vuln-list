  "Description": "The DNS protocol in RFC 1035 and updates allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by arranging for DNS queries to be accumulated for seconds, such that responses are later sent in a pulsing burst (which can be considered traffic amplification in some cases), aka the \"DNSBomb\" issue.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e Unbound itself is not vulnerable to the DNSBomb attack, but can",
    "mdeslaur\u003e be used to participate in one. The commit below adds some",
    "mdeslaur\u003e new options to make the impact from Unbound significantly lower.",
    "mdeslaur\u003e",
    "mdeslaur\u003e Backporting the commit to mantic and lower is intrusive and",
    "mdeslaur\u003e may introduce regressions."
