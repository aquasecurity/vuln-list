  "Description": "Symphony process is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which executes commands in sub-processes. When consuming a persisted remember-me cookie, Symfony does not check if the username persisted in the database matches the username attached with the cookie, leading to authentication bypass. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.4.47, 6.4.15, and 7.1.8.",
