  "Description": "Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability in Apache Tomcat Connectors allows local users to view and modify shared memory containing mod_jk configuration which may lead to information disclosure and/or denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors: from 1.2.9-beta through 1.2.49. Only mod_jk on Unix like systems is affected. Neither the ISAPI redirector nor mod_jk on Windows is affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.50, which fixes the issue.",
