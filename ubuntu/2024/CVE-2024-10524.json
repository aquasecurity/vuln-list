  "Description": "Applications that use Wget to access a remote resource using shorthand URLs and pass arbitrary user credentials in the URL are vulnerable. In these cases attackers can enter crafted credentials which will cause Wget to access an arbitrary host.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e the upstream fix removes shorthand support for URLs. Fixing this",
    "mdeslaur\u003e will change behaviour and may break existing uses of wget.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e This is only an issue when using a wget shorthand format URL",
