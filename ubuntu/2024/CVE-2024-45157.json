  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.9 and 3.x before 3.6.1, in which the user-selected algorithm is not used. Unlike previously documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does not cause the PSA subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "hlibk\u003e Affects versions since 2.26.0 until 2.28.9 and 3.6.1.",
    "hlibk\u003e Upstream developers have decided to accept the behavior and instead opted for fixing the documentation. As the fix only addresses the documentation, the priority has been lowered. The CVE description contains the relevant information to consider."
