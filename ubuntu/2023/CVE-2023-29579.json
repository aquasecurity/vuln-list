  "Description": "yasm 1.3.0.55.g101bc was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the component yasm/yasm+0x43b466 in vsprintf. Note: This has been disputed by third parties who argue this is a bug and not a security issue because yasm is a standalone program not designed to run untrusted code.",
