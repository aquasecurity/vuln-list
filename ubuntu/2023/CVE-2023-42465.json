  "Description": "Sudo before 1.9.15 might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication bypass or privilege escalation) because application logic sometimes is based on not equaling an error value (instead of equaling a success value), and because the values do not resist flips of a single bit.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e part of the code in the fix commit, in plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c, plugins/sudoers/auth/sudo_auth.c and plugins/sudoers/auth/sudo_auth.h is not built with Ubuntu as it is using PAM support. for the other part, the code fixed in plugins/sudoers/lookup.c was added in version 1.9.15. hence not affecting any Ubuntu releases, and for plugins/sudoers/match.c, part was added in 1.8.21, that if considered just by itself, it doesn't worth patching."
