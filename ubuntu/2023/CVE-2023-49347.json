  "Description": "Temporary data passed between application components by Budgie Extras Windows Previews could potentially be viewed or manipulated. The data is stored in a location that is accessible to any user who has local access to the system. Attackers may read private information from windows, present false information to users, or deny access to the application.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Matthias Gerstner discovered that the Windows Previews application of Budgie Extras used predictable temporary file paths which are world editable. An attacker could use this to inject false information, read information, or deny access to the application.",
