  ],
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the 9p passthrough filesystem (9pfs) implementation in QEMU. When a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or SGID, none of these privileged bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host local user to elevate privileges on the host.",
