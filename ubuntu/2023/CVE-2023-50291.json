  "Description": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr. This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0. One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had \"password\" contained in the name. There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as \"basicauth\" and \"aws.secretKey\" do not contain \"password\", thus their values were published via the \"/admin/info/properties\" endpoint. This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI. This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the \"config-read\" permission. Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the \"config-read\" permission. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue. A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, \"-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps\". By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including \"-Dbasicauth\"), as well as any property with a name containing \"secret\" or \"password\". Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue: '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'",
