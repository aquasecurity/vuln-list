The data is stored in a location that is accessible to any user who has local access to the system. Attackers may pre-create and control this file to present false information to users or deny access to the application and panel.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Matthias Gerstner discovered that the WeatherShow application of Budgie Extras used predictable temporary file paths which are world editable. An attacker could use this to inject false information, read information, or deny access to the application.",
