  "Description": "Information exposure through microarchitectural state after transient execution from some register files for some Intel(R) Atom(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that some Intel® Atom® Processors did not properly clear register state when performing various operations. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information via a transient execution attack.",
