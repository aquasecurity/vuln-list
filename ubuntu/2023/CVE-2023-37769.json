    "alexmurray\u003e Whilst the CVE description mentions the stress-test binary (which is only part of the test suite in pixman and itself is not distributed in Ubuntu) it is not clear if this is a bug in the underlying library code itself or just in stress-test",
    "mdeslaur\u003e New comment in upstream bug does suggest this issue is in the test binary",
    "mdeslaur\u003e as of 2023-09-22, there is no upstream fix available for this issue"
