  "Description": "YASM v1.3.0 was discovered to contain a heap overflow via the function handle_dot_label at /nasm/nasm-token.re. Note: This has been disputed by third parties who argue this is a bug and not a security issue because yasm is a standalone program not designed to run untrusted code.",
