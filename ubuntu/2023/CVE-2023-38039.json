  "Description": "When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API. However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series of headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e Vulnerable code exists since 7.83.0 but was an experimental feature not enabled by default and only enabled in 7.84.0. Fixed in upstream release 8.3.0."
