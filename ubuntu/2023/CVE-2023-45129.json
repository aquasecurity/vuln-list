  "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server ACL event can impact performance temporarily or permanently leading to a persistent denial of service. Homeservers running on a closed federation (which presumably do not need to use server ACLs) are not affected. Server administrators are advised to upgrade to Synapse 1.94.0 or later. As a workaround, rooms with malicious server ACL events can be purged and blocked using the admin API.",

    "john-breton\u003e DNE in bionic-jammy. Without that functionality, patching",
    "john-breton\u003e is infeasible, and those modules require significant",
    "john-breton\u003e revisions to even get to function with the older versions."
