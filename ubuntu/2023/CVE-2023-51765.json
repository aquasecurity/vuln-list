  "Description": "sendmail through 8.17.2 allows SMTP smuggling in certain configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because sendmail supports \u003cLF\u003e.\u003cCR\u003e\u003cLF\u003e but some other popular e-mail servers do not. This is resolved in 8.18 and later versions with 'o' in srv_features.",
