  "Description": "Improper validation in a model specific register (MSR) could allow a malicious program with ring0 access to modify SMM configuration while SMI lock is enabled, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Enrique Nissim and Krzysztof Okupski discovered that some AMD processors did not properly restrict access to the System Management Mode (SMM) configuration when the SMM Lock was enabled. A privileged local attacker could possibly use this issue to further escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code within the processor's firmware layer.",
  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e The affected processors were only released after the LTS period for Ubuntu 14.04 finished so there should be no affected machines running Ubuntu 14.04 hence this will not be patched in that release."
