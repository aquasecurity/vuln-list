  "Description": "php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.1, when handling `\u003cuse\u003e` tag that references an `\u003cimage\u003e` tag, it merges the attributes from the `\u003cuse\u003e` tag to the `\u003cimage\u003e` tag. The problem pops up especially when the `href` attribute from the `\u003cuse\u003e` tag has not been sanitized. This can lead to an unsafe file read that can cause PHAR Deserialization vulnerability in PHP prior to version 8. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue.",
