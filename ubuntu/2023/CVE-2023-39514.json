  "Description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `graphs.php` displays graph details such as data-source paths, data template information and graph related fields. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure either a data-source template with malicious code appended in the data-source name or a device with a malicious payload injected in the device name, may deploy a stored XSS attack against any user with _General Administration\u003eGraphs_ privileges. A user that possesses the _Template Editor\u003eData Templates_ permissions can configure the data-source name in _cacti_. Please note that this may be a _low privileged_ user. This configuration occurs through `http://\u003cHOST\u003e/cacti/data_templates.php` by editing an existing or adding a new data template. If a template is linked to a graph then the formatted template name will be rendered in the graph's management page. A user that possesses the _General Administration\u003eSites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device name in _cacti_. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should add manual HTML escaping. ",
