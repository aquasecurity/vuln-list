  "Notes": [
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e the first commit was claimed to introduce regressions, so we should consider the follow up commits that makes the check a bit less restrictive.",
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e one of the regressions was caught by debian in libimager-perl, https://bugs.debian.org/1057270. with the proposed follow up commits, we should be clear wit that regression"
