  "Description": "A path disclosure vulnerability was found in Samba. As part of the Spotlight protocol, Samba discloses the server-side absolute path of shares, files, and directories in the results for search queries. This flaw allows a malicious client or an attacker with a targeted RPC request to view the information that is part of the disclosed path.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e spotlight support was enabled in ubuntu packages in 2:4.13.2+dfsg-3ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 21.04 / hirsute) and in the 2:4.13.14+dfsg-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 backport to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / focal.
