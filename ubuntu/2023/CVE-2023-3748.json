  "Description": "A flaw was found in FRRouting when parsing certain babeld unicast hello messages that are intended to be ignored. This issue may allow an attacker to send specially crafted hello messages with the unicast flag set, the interval field set to 0, or any TLV that contains a sub-TLV with the Mandatory flag set to enter an infinite loop and cause a denial of service.",
