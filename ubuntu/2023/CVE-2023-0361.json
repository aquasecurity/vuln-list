  "Description": "A timing side-channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange messages was discovered in GnuTLS. This side-channel can be sufficient to recover the key encrypted in the RSA ciphertext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption the attacker would need to send a large amount of specially crafted messages to the vulnerable server. By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e bionic already contains a sidechannel in RSA decryption because",
    "mdeslaur\u003e CVE-2018-16868 is not fixed due to it being too intrusive. We",
    "mdeslaur\u003e will ignore this CVE for bionic and earlier also."
