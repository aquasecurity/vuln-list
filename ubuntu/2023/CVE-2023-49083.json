  "Description": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability poses a serious risk of Denial of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to deserialize a PKCS7 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions in system availability and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in version 41.0.6.",
