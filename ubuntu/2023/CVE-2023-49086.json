  "Description": "Cacti is a robust performance and fault management framework and a frontend to RRDTool - a Time Series Database (TSDB). A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.27 bypasses an earlier fix for CVE-2023-39360, therefore leading to a DOM XSS attack. Exploitation of the vulnerability is possible for an authorized user. The vulnerable component is the `graphs_new.php`. The impact of the vulnerability is execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the attacked user's browser. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.27.",
