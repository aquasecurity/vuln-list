  "Description": "Versions of the package angular from 1.4.9 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the \u003cinput type=\"url\"\u003e element due to the usage of an insecure regular expression in the input[url] functionality. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible by a large carefully-crafted input, which can result in catastrophic backtracking.",
