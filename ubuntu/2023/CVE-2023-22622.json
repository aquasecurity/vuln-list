  "Description": "WordPress through 6.1.1 depends on unpredictable client visits to cause wp-cron.php execution and the resulting security updates, and the source code describes \"the scenario where a site may not receive enough visits to execute scheduled tasks in a timely manner,\" but neither the installation guide nor the security guide mentions this default behavior, or alerts the user about security risks on installations with very few visits.",
