  "Description": "A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in afpd in Netatalk 3.1.x before 3.1.17. When parsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may be able to fully control the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve Remote Code Execution on the host. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-34967.",

  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e 2.x versions and older do not support the spotlight protocol, support introduced in 3.1.0",
    "sbeattie\u003e code affected shares origin with samba's mdssvc.c; this issue is the netatalk version of the samba CVE-2023-34967"
