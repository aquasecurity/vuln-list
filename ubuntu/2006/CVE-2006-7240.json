  "Description": "gnome-power-manager 2.14.0 does not properly implement the lock_on_suspend and lock_on_hibernate settings for locking the screen when the suspend or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action, a related issue to CVE-2010-2532.",

    "sbeattie\u003e this is somewhat confusing, this CVE is only referring to the issue that was fixed in the gutsy timeframe. The followup reappearance during karmic referred to in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/428115 is another CVE, CVE-2009-4997."
