  "Description": "Race condition in the Xsession script, as used by X Display Manager (xdm) in NetBSD before 20060212, X.Org before 20060225, and Solaris 8 through 10 before 20061006, causes a user's Xsession errors file to have weak permissions before a chmod is performed, which allows local users to read Xsession errors files of other users.",
