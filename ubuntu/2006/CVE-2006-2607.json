  "Description": "do_command.c in Vixie cron (vixie-cron) 4.1 does not check the return code of a setuid call, which might allow local users to gain root privileges if setuid fails in cases such as PAM failures or resource limits, as originally demonstrated by a program that exceeds the process limits as defined in /etc/security/limits.conf.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e was mistakenly marked not-affected. 3.0pl1-64 added checks for setuid() failing, but did not add the checks for setgid() or initgroups()"
