  "Description": "gpg in GnuPG before 1.4.2.2 does not properly verify non-detached signatures, which allows attackers to inject unsigned data via a data packet that is not associated with a control packet, which causes the check for concatenated signatures to report that the signature is valid, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0455.",
