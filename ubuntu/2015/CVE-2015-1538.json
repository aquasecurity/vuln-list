  "Description": "Integer overflow in the SampleTable::setSampleToChunkParams function in SampleTable.cpp in libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted atoms in MP4 data that trigger an unchecked multiplication, aka internal bug 20139950, a related issue to CVE-2015-4496.",

    "jdstrand\u003e there are limited public details on the issue and these will not be disclosed until BlackHat/DEFCON next month. Will use this CVE for all information until details are published",
    "jdstrand\u003e the following patches are the likely fixes (12.1): http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/102619/ (code not present, requires edd4a76eb4747bd19ed122df46fa46b452c12a0d) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/102620/ (ebf0d0940f7f42b220b19d3baaee7efb4c6b787d) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/102623/ (4a39c150327e080072d5f8e4239c6bbbbabd48d8) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/103266/ (7ff5505d36b1cfd8b03497e0fb5aa24b5b099e45) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/103267/ (b1f29294f1a5831eb52a81d3ee082a9475f6e879) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/103268/ (889ae4ad7227c395615d03b24a1667caa162c75f) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/103269/ (9824bfd6eec1daa93cf76b6f4199602fe35f1d9d, code not present on 15.04/15.10) http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/103270/ (57db9b42418b434751f609ac7e5539367e9f01a6, code not present on 15.04/15.10)",
    "jdstrand\u003e the attack appears to be if an application opens a specially crafted MPEG4 file, an attacker could cause an application crash or execute arbitrary code by accessing out of bounds memory. In the case of android, the video could be texted to the victim's number and the system will automatically start processing the video by examining the video's container and metadata",
    "jdstrand\u003e Ubuntu's 'android' package is based on Cyanogenmod 12.0",
    "jdstrand\u003e Ubuntu 14.04 'android' package is affected but no supported images use it",
    "jdstrand\u003e All patches (ESDS, SampleTable and MPEG4Extractor) are for MPEG-4 processing",
    "jdstrand\u003e media-hub will typically process MPEG4 files for the system and it uses gst-plugins-bad which uses media_codec_* from libhybris but libhybris doesn't expose the affected stagefright code (confirmed with jhodapp and rsalveti). Therefore, the specific attack of texting a crafted video will not work",
    "jdstrand\u003e services and well-behaved Ubuntu Store apps may access the stagefright library via libhybris, but libhybris doesn't expose the affected code so these services and apps are not affected",
    "jdstrand\u003e malicious Ubuntu Store apps could access the stagefright library but are otherwise isolated by the app-specific AppArmor profiles",
    "jdstrand\u003e malicious Ubuntu Store apps could access one of the binder services in the container via /dev/binder but none of them use stagefright (the services are: healthd, servicemanager, rild, drmserver, camera_service and sensorservice, all confirmed via their respective Android.mk files to not link stagefright)",
