  "Description": "click/install.py in click does not require files in package filesystem tarballs to start with ./ (dot slash), which allows remote attackers to install an alternate security policy and gain privileges via a crafted package, as demonstrated by the test.mmrow app for Ubuntu phone.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e app can ship a crafted .click directory that can be used to trick click into installing unintended security policy",
    "jdstrand\u003e snappy not affected per me and mvo",
    "jdstrand\u003e patch from cjwatson, but not committed to bzr yet",
    "jdstrand\u003e updates also needed for vivid stable-phone-overlay and wily stable-phone-overlay."
