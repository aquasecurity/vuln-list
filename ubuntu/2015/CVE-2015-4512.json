  "Description": "gfx/2d/DataSurfaceHelpers.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 on Linux improperly attempts to use the Cairo library with 32-bit color-depth surface creation followed by 16-bit color-depth surface display, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) by using a CANVAS element to trigger 2D rendering.",
