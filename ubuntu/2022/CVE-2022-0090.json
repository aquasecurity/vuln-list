  "Description": "An issue has been discovered affecting GitLab versions prior to 14.4.5, between 14.5.0 and 14.5.3, and between 14.6.0 and 14.6.1. GitLab is configured in a way that it doesn't ignore replacement references with git sub-commands, allowing a malicious user to spoof the contents of their commits in the UI.",
