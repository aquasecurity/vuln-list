  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6. The Trunc() and Extract() database functions are subject to SQL injection if untrusted data is used as a kind/lookup_name value. Applications that constrain the lookup name and kind choice to a known safe list are unaffected.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray| original advisory only lists 3.2.x and 4.x as affected but looks like 1.11.x as used in bionic and 2.2.x as used in focal/impish are also likely vulnerable too"
