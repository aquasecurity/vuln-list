  "Description": "Arm: unbounded memory consumption for 2nd-level page tables Certain actions require e.g. removing pages from a guest's P2M (Physical-to-Machine) mapping. When large pages are in use to map guest pages in the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may incur a memory allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones). These memory allocations are taken from the global memory pool. A malicious guest might be able to cause the global memory pool to be exhausted by manipulating its own P2M mappings.",
