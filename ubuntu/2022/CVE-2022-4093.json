  "Description": "SQL injection attacks can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period. This affect 16.0.1 and 16.0.2 only. 16.0.0 or lower, and 16.0.3 or higher are not affected",
