  "Description": "NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit SDK contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in cuobjdump, where an unprivileged remote attacker could exploit this buffer overflow condition by persuading a local user to download a specially crafted corrupted file and execute cuobjdump against it locally, which may lead to a limited denial of service and some loss of data integrity for the local user.",
