  "Description": "sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Starting in version 0.2.7 and prior to version 0.2.10, if a user begins entering a password but does not press return for an extended period, a password timeout may occur. When this happens, the keystrokes that were entered are echoed back to the console. This could reveal partial password information, possibly exposing history files when not carefully handled by the user and on screen, usable for Social Engineering or Pass-By attacks. Version 0.2.10 fixes the issue.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e passwords timeouts were added in sudo-rs 0.2.7, so versions prior to that are not affected.",
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e USN-7867-1 references LP bug 2130623 but not the CVE because the CVE was assigned later than the package update publication, but it refers to the fix for this issue on questing."
