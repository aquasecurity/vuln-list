    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e AMD SB mentions fix in both SEV (amd/) and ucode (amd-ucode/) binaries. didn't find matches in upstream for SEV binaries but ucode versions found in upstream version: 2025-07-29",
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e This is not planned to be fixed for the amd64-microcode package in Ubuntu 14.04 as that release was already outside of the LTS timeframe when this hardware platform was launched."
