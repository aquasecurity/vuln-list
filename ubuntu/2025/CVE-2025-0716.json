  "Description": "Improper sanitization of the value of the 'href' and 'xlink:href' attributes in '\u003cimage\u003e' SVG elements in AngularJS allows attackers to bypass common image source restrictions. This can lead to a form of Content Spoofing https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing and also negatively affect the application's performance and behavior by using too large or slow-to-load images. This issue affects all versions of AngularJS. Note: The AngularJS project is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue. For more information see  here https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/version-support-status .",
