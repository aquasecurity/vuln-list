  "Description": "Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When Axios starting in version 0.28.0 and prior to versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`. Versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 contain a patch for the issue.",
