  "Description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions 8.2.0 and above, a user can run the XACKDEL command with multiple ID's and trigger a stack buffer overflow, which may potentially lead to remote code execution. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.3. To workaround this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing XACKDEL operation. This can be done using ACL to restrict XACKDEL command.",
