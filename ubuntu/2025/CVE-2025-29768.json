  "Description": "Vim, a text editor, is vulnerable to potential data loss with zip.vim and special crafted zip files in versions prior to 9.1.1198. The impact is medium because a user must be made to view such an archive with Vim and then press 'x' on such a strange filename. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1198.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "hlibk\u003e The advisory states that the vulnerability happens due to overwriting files with the -o option. The usage of -o option was introduced in version 9.1.0686, and therefore prior releases don't seem to be affected."
