  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in libxml2 up to 2.14.5. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function xmlParseSGMLCatalog of the component xmlcatalog. The manipulation leads to uncontrolled recursion. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The code maintainer explains, that \"[t]he issue can only be triggered with untrusted SGML catalogs and it makes absolutely no sense to use untrusted catalogs. I also doubt that anyone is still using SGML catalogs at all.\"",

  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e This is just a recursive parsing issue, and per the libxml2",
    "mdeslaur\u003e developers it \"can only be triggered with untrusted SGML",
    "mdeslaur\u003e catalogs and it makes absolutely no sense to use untrusted",
    "mdeslaur\u003e catalogs\". Marking as low priority."
