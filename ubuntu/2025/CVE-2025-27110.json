  "Description": "Libmodsecurity is one component of the ModSecurity v3 project. The library codebase serves as an interface to ModSecurity Connectors taking in web traffic and applying traditional ModSecurity processing. A bug that exists only in Libmodsecurity3 version 3.0.13 means that, in 3.0.13, Libmodsecurity3 can't decode encoded HTML entities if they contains leading zeroes. Version 3.0.14 contains a fix. No known workarounds are available.",
