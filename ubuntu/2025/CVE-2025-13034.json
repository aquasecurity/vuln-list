  "Description": "When using `CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY` option with libcurl or `--pinnedpubkey` with the curl tool, curl checks the public key of the server certificate to verify the peer. This check was skipped in a certain condition that would then make curl allow the connection without performing the proper check, thus not noticing a possible impostor. To skip this check, the connection had to be done with QUIC with ngtcp2 built to use GnuTLS and the user had to explicitly disable the standard certificate verification.",
