  "Description": "An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record Sets. Processing and caching results for these sets can lead to an illegal memory accesses and crash of the Recursor, causing a denial of service. The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 5.2.1 version. We would like to thank Volodymyr Ilyin for bringing this issue to our attention.",
