  "Description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Radare2 5.9.9. Affected by this issue is the function r_cons_flush in the library /libr/cons/cons.c of the component radiff2. The manipulation of the argument -T leads to use after free. Local access is required to approach this attack. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The name of the patch is 5705d99cc1f23f36f9a84aab26d1724010b97798. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The documentation explains that the parameter -T is experimental and \"crashy\". Further analysis has shown \"the race is not a real problem unless you use asan\". A new warning has been added.",
