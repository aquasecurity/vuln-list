  "Description": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a stack overflow that causes Suricata to crash can occur if SWF decompression is enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves disabling SWF decompression (swf-decompression in suricata.yaml), it is disabled by default; set decompress-depth to lower than half your stack size if swf-decompression must be enabled.",
