  "Description": "A flaw was found in the 389-ds-base LDAP Server. This issue occurs when issuing a Modify DN LDAP operation through the ldap protocol, when the function return value is not tested and a NULL pointer is dereferenced. If a privileged user performs a ldap MODDN operation after a failed operation, it could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or system crash.",
