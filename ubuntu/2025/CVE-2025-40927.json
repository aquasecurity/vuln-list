  "Description": "CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions. Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters. As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks. The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete. Impact By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can: *  Break the current HTTP header *  Inject a new header or entire body *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response That can lead to the following attacks: *  reflected XSS *  open redirect *  cache poisoning *  header manipulation",
