  "Description": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions 7.0.10 and below and  8.0.0-beta1 through 8.0.0-rc1, mishandling of data on HTTP2 stream 0 can lead to uncontrolled memory usage, leading to loss of visibility. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser, and using a signature like drop http2 any any -\u003e any any (frame:http2.hdr; byte_test:1,=,0,3; byte_test:4,=,0,5; sid: 1;) where the first byte test tests the HTTP2 frame type DATA and the second tests the stream id 0. This is fixed in versions 7.0.11 and 8.0.0.",
