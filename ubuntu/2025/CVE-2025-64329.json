  "Description": "containerd is an open-source container runtime. Versions 1.7.28 and below, 2.0.0-beta.0 through 2.0.6, 2.1.0-beta.0 through 2.1.4, and 2.2.0-beta.0 through 2.2.0-rc.1 contain a bug in the CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host due to goroutine leaks. This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. To workaround this vulnerability, users can set up an admission controller to control accesses to pods/attach resources.",
