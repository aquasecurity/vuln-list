  "Description": "A flaw was found in Epiphany, a tool that allows websites to open external URL handler applications with minimal user interaction. This design can be misused to exploit vulnerabilities within those handlers, making them appear remotely exploitable. The browser fails to properly warn or gate this action, resulting in potential code execution on the client device via trusted UI behavior.",
