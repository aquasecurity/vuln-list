  "Description": "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability in Apache Tomcat when using the APR/Native connector. This was particularly noticeable with client initiated closes of HTTP/2 connections. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.106. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.107, which fixes the issue.",
