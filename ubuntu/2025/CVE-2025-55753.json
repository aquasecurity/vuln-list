  "Description": "An integer overflow in the case of failed ACME certificate renewal leads, after a number of failures (~30 days in default configurations), to the backoff timer becoming 0. Attempts to renew the certificate then are repeated without delays until it succeeds. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.30 before 2.4.66. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.66, which fixes the issue.",
