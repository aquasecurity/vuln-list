  ],
  "Description": "A flaw was found in GNU Wget2. This vulnerability, a stack-based buffer overflow, occurs in the filename sanitization logic when processing attacker-controlled URL paths, particularly when filename restriction options are active. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL, which, upon user interaction with wget2, can lead to memory corruption. This can cause the application to crash and potentially allow for further malicious activities.",
