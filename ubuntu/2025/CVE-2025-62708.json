  "Description": "pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. Prior to version 6.1.3, an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to large memory usage. This requires parsing the content stream of a page using the LZWDecode filter. This has been fixed in pypdf version 6.1.3.",
