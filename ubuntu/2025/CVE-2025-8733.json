  "Description": "A flaw has been found in GNU Bison up to 3.8.2. This affects the function __obstack_vprintf_internal of the file obprintf.c. Executing manipulation can lead to reachable assertion. The attack requires local access. The exploit has been published and may be used. It is still unclear if this vulnerability genuinely exists. The issue could not be reproduced from a GNU Bison 3.8.2 tarball run in a Fedora 42 container.",
