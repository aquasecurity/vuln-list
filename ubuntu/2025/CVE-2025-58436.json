  "Description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Prior to version 2.4.15, a client that connects to cupsd but sends slow messages, e.g. only one byte per second, delays cupsd as a whole, such that it becomes unusable by other clients. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.15.",
