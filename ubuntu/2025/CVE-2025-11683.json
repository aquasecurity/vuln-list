  "Description": "YAML::Syck versions before 1.36 for Perl has missing null-terminators which causes out-of-bounds read and potential information disclosure Missing null terminators in token.c leads to but-of-bounds read which allows adjacent variable to be read The issue is seen with complex YAML files with a hash of all keys and empty values.Â  There is no indication that the issue leads to accessing memory outside that allocated to the module.",
