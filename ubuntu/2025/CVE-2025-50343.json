  "Description": "An issue was discovered in matio 1.5.28. A heap-based memory corruption can occur in Mat_VarCreateStruct() when the nfields value does not match the actual number of strings in the fields array. This leads to out-of-bounds reads and invalid memory frees during cleanup, potentially causing a segmentation fault or heap corruption.",
