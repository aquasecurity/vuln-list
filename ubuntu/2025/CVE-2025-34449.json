  "Description": "Genymobile/scrcpy versions up to and including 3.3.3 and prior to commit 3e40b24 contain a global buffer overflow vulnerability in the function sc_read32be, invoked via sc_device_msg_deserialize() and process_msgs(). Processing crafted device messages can cause reads beyond the bounds of a global buffer, leading to memory corruption or crashes. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain conditions, may be leveraged for further exploitation depending on the execution environment and available mitigations.",
