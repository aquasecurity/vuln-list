  "Description": "merbanan/rtl_433 versions up to and including 25.02 and prior to commit 25e47f8 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function parse_rfraw() located in src/rfraw.c. When processing crafted or excessively large raw RF input data, the application may write beyond the bounds of a stack buffer, resulting in memory corruption or a crash. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain conditions, may be leveraged for further exploitation depending on the execution environment and available mitigations.",
