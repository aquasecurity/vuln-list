  "Description": "PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. In versions 2.5.377 and below, an unchecked offset and size used in a memcpy operation inside PCSX2's CDVD SCMD 0x91 and SCMD 0x8F handlers allow a specially crafted disc image or ELF to cause an out-of-bounds read from emulator memory. Because the offset and size is controlled through MG header fields, a specially crafted ELF can read data beyond the bounds of mg_buffer and have it reflected back into emulated memory. This issue is fixed in version 2.5.378.",
