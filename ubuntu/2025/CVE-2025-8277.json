  "Description": "A flaw was found in libssh's handling of key exchange (KEX) processes when a client repeatedly sends incorrect KEX guesses. The library fails to free memory during these rekey operations, which can gradually exhaust system memory. This issue can lead to crashes on the client side, particularly when using libgcrypt, which impacts application stability and availability.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e This does not affect servers, only clients and is only a memory",
    "mdeslaur\u003e leak that may eventually lead to a crash."
