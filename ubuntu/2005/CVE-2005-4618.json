  "Description": "Buffer overflow in sysctl in the Linux Kernel 2.6 before 2.6.15 allows local users to corrupt user memory and possibly cause a denial of service via a long string, which causes sysctl to write a zero byte outside the buffer.  NOTE: since the sysctl is called from a userland program that provides the argument, this might not be a vulnerability, unless a legitimate user-assisted or setuid scenario can be identified.",
