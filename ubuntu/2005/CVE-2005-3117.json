  "Description": "** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2005-3150. Reason: This candidate was privately assigned by a CNA to an issue, but the issue was published through separate channels and assigned a new identifier by the MITRE CNA, so it is a duplicate of CVE-2005-3150. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2005-3150 instead of this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage.",
