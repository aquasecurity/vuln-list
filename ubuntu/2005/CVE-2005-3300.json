  "Description": "The register_globals emulation layer in grab_globals.php for phpMyAdmin before 2.6.4-pl3 does not perform safety checks on values in the _FILES array for uploaded files, which allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files by using direct requests to library scripts that do not use grab_globals.php, then modifying certain configuration values for the theme.",
