  "Description": "phpBB 2.0.17 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled and the session_start function has not been called to handle a session, allows remote attackers to bypass security checks by setting the $_SESSION and $HTTP_SESSION_VARS variables to strings instead of arrays, which causes an array_merge function call to fail.",
