  "Description": "The AES-XCBC-MAC algorithm in IPsec in FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used for authentication without other encryption, uses a constant key instead of the one that was assigned by the system administrator, which can allow remote attackers to spoof packets to establish an IPsec session.",
