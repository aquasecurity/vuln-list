  ],
  "Description": "The default configuration of Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR) Festival 1.95 beta (aka 2.0 beta) on Gentoo Linux, SUSE Linux, and possibly other distributions, is run locally with elevated privileges without requiring authentication, which allows local and remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the local daemon on port 1314, a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-0956.  NOTE: this issue is local in some environments, but remote on others.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "kees\u003e not as serious as in Gentoo, Debian's festival runs as nobody",
    "jdstrand\u003e in addition to running as nobody, it also does not start on boot by default (must edit the initscript) in dapper - gutsy (but does on hardy)",
    "jdstrand\u003e fix would likely include documentation fixes with a big warning in the initscript",
    "jstrand\u003e fix not released for gutsy, as debian bug #435445 did not fully address the issue",
    "jdstrand\u003e hardy runs server by default (1.96~beta-5ubuntu1)",
    "jdstrand\u003e marked hardy as fixed-- don't start server by default, non-prvileged user and notes on using --server"
