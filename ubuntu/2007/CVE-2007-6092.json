  "Description": "Buffer overflow in libsrtp in Ingate Firewall before 4.6.0 and SIParator before 4.6.0 has unknown impact and attack vectors.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e according to http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=5413#39752, Ingate's libsrtp is based on Cisco's libsrtp (which is what is in universe).  This lib is BSD licensed and I can't find Ingate's source.  As such, I am leaving this as 'needs-triage'",
    "mdeslaur\u003e no details that srtp was ever affected by this, let's ignore"
