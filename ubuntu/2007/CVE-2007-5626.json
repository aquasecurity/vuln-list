  "Description": "make_catalog_backup in Bacula 2.2.5, and probably earlier, sends a MySQL password as a command line argument, and sometimes transmits cleartext e-mail containing this command line, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain the password by listing the process and its arguments, or by sniffing the network.",
