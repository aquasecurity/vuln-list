  "Description": "The CUPS service on multiple platforms allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service hang) via a \"partially-negotiated\" SSL connection, which prevents other requests from being accepted.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "kees\u003e The \"fix\" isn't really a fix, and just worsens the diagnostics available to an admin seeking the DoS.  This is a design problem with CUPS."
