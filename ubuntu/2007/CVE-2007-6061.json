  "Description": "Audacity 1.3.2 creates a temporary directory with a predictable name without checking for previous existence of that directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (recording deadlock) by creating the directory before Audacity is run.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to delete arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "fujitsu\u003e The denial of service requires changing the ownership of the directory after audacity is already running."
