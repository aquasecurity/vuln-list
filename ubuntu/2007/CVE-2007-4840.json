  "Description": "PHP 5.2.4 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via (1) a long string in the out_charset parameter to the iconv function; or a long string in the charset parameter to the (2) iconv_mime_decode_headers, (3) iconv_mime_decode, or (4) iconv_strlen function.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless these issues can be demonstrated for code execution.",
