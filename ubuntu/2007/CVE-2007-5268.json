  "Description": "pngrtran.c in libpng before 1.0.29 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21 use (1) logical instead of bitwise operations and (2) incorrect comparisons, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PNG image.",

  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e given medium because of wide install base",
    "jdstrand\u003e bug (1) is said to have been introduced in 1.2.19.  Looking at pngrtran.c in 1.2.8 and 1.2.15 (as included in Ubuntu), the vulnerable code is not present",
    "jdstrand\u003e bug (2) still applies to 1.2.15, but not 1.2.8",
    "jdstrand\u003e reducing to negligible as pngset.c change should not do anything"
