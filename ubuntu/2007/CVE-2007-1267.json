  "Description": "Sylpheed 2.2.7 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking GnuPG, which prevents Sylpheed from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without detection.",

    "fujitsu\u003e Not important, as GnuPG was fixed in CVE-2007-1263."
