  "Description": "Certain chunk handlers in libpng before 1.0.29 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted (1) pCAL (png_handle_pCAL), (2) sCAL (png_handle_sCAL), (3) tEXt (png_push_read_tEXt), (4) iTXt (png_handle_iTXt), and (5) ztXT (png_handle_ztXt) chunking in PNG images, which trigger out-of-bounds read operations.",

  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e assigned medium because of wide install base",
    "jdstrand\u003e looking at diff between 1.2.20 and 1.2.21, it appears that Ubuntu is affected, though Debian thinks not.  After weeding out the changes, there are 9 chunks over pngpread.c and pngrutil.c that appear to be for this CVE (the original patch improperly used png_strncpy, where our versions have png_strcpy).  TODO: get a reproducer and/or verify png_strcpy is really not vulnerable.",
    "jdstrand\u003e after talking on IRC, Debian agreed they are in fact affected",
    "jdstrand\u003e 2007/10/24 RH update: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0992.html",
    "jdstrand\u003e RH has added code to pngrtran.c that was not included upstream. Sticking with changes to pngpread.c and pngrutil.c until upstream can provide a reproducer."
