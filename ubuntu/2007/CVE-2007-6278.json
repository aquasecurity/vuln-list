  "Description": "Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC before 1.2.1 allows user-assisted remote attackers to force a client to download arbitrary files via the MIME-Type URL flag (--\u003e) for the FLAC image file in a crafted .FLAC file.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e checked diff from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 and found the mime parts. These were included in the fix for CVE-2007-4619 for gutsy. 1.1.2 does not have the mime code in libFLAC",
    "jdstrand\u003e note that CVE-2007-4619 was very general and came out before the iDefense CVEs, so there is overlap"
