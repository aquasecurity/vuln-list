  "Description": "Double free vulnerability in the krb5_def_store_mkey function in lib/kdb/kdb_default.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.5 has unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors.  NOTE: the free operations occur in code that stores the krb5kdc master key, and so the attacker must have privileges to store this key.",
