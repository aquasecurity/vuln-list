  "Description": "The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 20070504 does not properly null terminate data, which allows remote attackers to trigger loss of transmitted data, and possibly obtain sensitive information (memory contents) or cause a denial of service (application crash), by sending a frame that lacks a 0 byte.",
