  "Description": "ActionScript 3 (AS3) in Adobe Flash Player 9.0.47.0, and other versions and other 9.0.124.0 and earlier versions, allows remote attackers to bypass the Security Sandbox Model, obtain sensitive information, and port scan arbitrary hosts via a Flash (SWF) movie that specifies a connection to make, then uses timing discrepancies from the SecurityErrorEvent error to determine whether a port is open or not.  NOTE: 9.0.115.0 introduces support for a workaround, but does not fix the vulnerability.",
