  "Description": "KDE Konqueror 3.5.5 and 3.95.00, when a user accepts an SSL server certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field, regards the certificate as also accepted for all domain names in subjectAltName:dNSName fields, even though these fields cannot be examined in the product, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site.",
