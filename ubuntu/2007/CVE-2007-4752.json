  ],
  "Description": "ssh in OpenSSH before 4.7 does not properly handle when an untrusted cookie cannot be created and uses a trusted X11 cookie instead, which allows attackers to violate intended policy and gain privileges by causing an X client to be treated as trusted.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e from secure-testing: An exploit needs limited control over the machine running a trusted X client, so this is only a slight privilege escalation.  The X Security extension is merely an afterthought and is unlikely to provide strong security guarantees."
