  "Description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. A user can execute a remote code execution attack against a server when phpMyAdmin is being run as a CGI application. Under certain server configurations, a user can pass a query string which is executed as a command-line argument by the file generator_plugin.sh. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that phpmyadmin incorrectly handled request query strings. An attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.",
