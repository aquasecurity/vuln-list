  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. A malicious Apport crash file can contain a restart command in `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline` fields. This command will be executed if a user clicks the Relaunch button on the Apport prompt from the malicious crash file. The fix is to only show the Relaunch button on Apport crash files generated by local systems. The Relaunch button will be hidden when crash files are opened directly in Apport-GTK.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport would offer to restart an application based on the contents of the RespawnCommand or ProcCmdline fields in a crash file. An attacker could use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user.",
