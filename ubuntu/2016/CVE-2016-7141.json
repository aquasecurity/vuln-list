  "Description": "curl and libcurl before 7.50.2, when built with NSS and the libnsspem.so library is available at runtime, allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of a TLS connection by leveraging reuse of a previously loaded client certificate from file for a connection for which no certificate has been set, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5420.",
