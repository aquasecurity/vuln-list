  "Description": "In all versions of AppArmor mount rules are accidentally widened when compiled.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that the AppArmor policy compiler incorrectly generated looser restrictions than expected for rules allowing mount operations. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass AppArmor restrictions in applications where some mount operations were permitted.",
  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e apparmor policies that do not grant the ability to perform any mount permissions are not affected.",
    "alexmurray\u003e Original fix introduced a regression, requiring the fix from https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/merge_requests/1048 as well",
    "sbeattie\u003e additional regression fix in https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/merge_requests/1054"
