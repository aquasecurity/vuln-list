  "Description": "An authenticated user without any specific authorizations may be able to repeatedly invoke the features command where at a high volume may lead to resource depletion or generate high lock contention. This may result in denial of service and in rare cases could result in id field collisions. This issue affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to and including 5.0.3; MongoDB Server v4.4 versions prior to and including 4.4.9; MongoDB Server v4.2 versions prior to and including 4.2.16 and MongoDB Server v4.0 versions prior to and including 4.0.28",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e the `oidReset` command implementation has existed in a couple of different locations in mongodb history, in src/mongo/db/commands/generic.cpp during 3.6.x and src/mongo/db/dbcommands_generic.cpp in 2.x timeframe. All of those implementations of `oidReset` lack an authorization requirement.",
    "sbeattie\u003e all of the upstream commits for this issue are on branches licensed under mongodb's SSPL, which makes backporting them to GNU Affero licensed versions problematic."
