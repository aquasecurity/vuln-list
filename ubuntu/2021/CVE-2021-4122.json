  "Description": "It was found that a specially crafted LUKS header could trick cryptsetup into disabling encryption during the recovery of the device. An attacker with physical access to the medium, such as a flash disk, could use this flaw to force a user into permanently disabling the encryption layer of that medium.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",

    "mdeslaur\u003e per upstream, the backport to 2.2 would be very problematic and",
