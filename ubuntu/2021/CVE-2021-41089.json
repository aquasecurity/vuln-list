  "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files using `docker cp` into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the hostâ€™s filesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers do not need to be restarted.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Lei Wang and Ruizhi Xiao discovered that the Moby Docker engine subsystem in Docker incorrectly allowed the docker cp command to make permissions changes in the host filesystem in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use to this to expose sensitive information or gain administrative privileges.",
