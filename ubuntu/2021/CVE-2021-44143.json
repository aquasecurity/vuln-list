  "Description": "A flaw was found in mbsync in isync 1.4.0 through 1.4.3. Due to an unchecked condition, a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use a crafted mail message that lacks headers (i.e., one that starts with an empty line) to provoke a heap overflow, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "seth-arnold\u003e I can't find a fix for this in the source browser; I'm marking jammy as 'needed' and others as 'not-affected' based on the version number, but I distrust the upper end of the '1.4.0 through 1.4.3' range given in the CVE description. I suspect \"unfixed\" is the more correct upper range."
