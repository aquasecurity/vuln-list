  "Description": "When curl is instructed to get content using the metalink feature, and a user name and password are used to download the metalink XML file, those same credentials are then subsequently passed on to each of the servers from which curl will download or try to download the contents from. Often contrary to the user's expectations and intentions and without telling the user it happened.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e introduced in 7.27.0",
    "mdeslaur\u003e per upstream \"curl has completely removed the metalink feature",
    "mdeslaur\u003e as of 7.78.0. No fix for this flaw will be produced by the curl",
    "mdeslaur\u003e project. The fix for earlier versions is to rebuild curl",
    "mdeslaur\u003e with the metalink support switched off!\"",
    "mdeslaur\u003e Ubuntu builds curl with metalink support switched off already."
