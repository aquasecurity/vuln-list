  "Description": "Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. Prior to version 8.13.8, malicious diagrams can run javascript code at diagram readers' machines. Users should upgrade to version 8.13.8 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.",
