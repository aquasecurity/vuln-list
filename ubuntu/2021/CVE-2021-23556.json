  "Description": "The package guake before 3.8.5 are vulnerable to Exposed Dangerous Method or Function due to the exposure of execute_command and execute_command_by_uuid methods via the d-bus interface, which makes it possible for a malicious user to run an arbitrary command via the d-bus method. **Note:** Exploitation requires the user to have installed another malicious program that will be able to send dbus signals or run terminal commands.",
