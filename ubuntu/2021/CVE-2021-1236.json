  "Description": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort application detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured policies on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the detection algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that would flow through an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network.",
