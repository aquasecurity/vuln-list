  "Description": "An issue was discovered in stb stb_image.h 1.33 through 2.27. The HDR loader parsed truncated end-of-file RLE scanlines as an infinite sequence of zero-length runs. An attacker could potentially have caused denial of service in applications using stb_image by submitting crafted HDR files.",
