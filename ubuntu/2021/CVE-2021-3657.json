  "Description": "A flaw was found in mbsync versions prior to 1.4.4. Due to inadequate handling of extremely large (\u003e=2GiB) IMAP literals, malicious or compromised IMAP servers, and hypothetically even external email senders, could cause several different buffer overflows, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.",
