  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Sergey Bobrov discovered that Ceph's RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) allowed the injection of HTTP headers in responses to CORS requests. An attacker could use this to violate system integrity.",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e this is fixed in 16.2.4 in hirsute-updates but has not been",
