  "Description": "curl, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before version 7.19.7-53, did not correctly backport the fix for CVE-2015-3148 because it did not reflect the fact that the HAVE_GSSAPI define was meanwhile substituted by USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. This issue was introduced in RHEL 6.7 and affects RHEL 6 curl only.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e Is an issue in Red Hat's backport as their old version doesn't",
    "mdeslaur\u003e have USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. Doesn't affect precise and newer."
