  "Description": "In PCRE 8.41, the OP_KETRMAX feature in the match function in pcre_exec.c allows stack exhaustion (uncontrolled recursion) when processing a crafted regular expression.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e reproducer in oss-security posting.",
    "sbeattie\u003e to exploit this requires an application take regular expressions as untrusted input (not just the string to match against), which is generally not safe to do with pcre."
