  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "tyhicks\u003e I believe that this was introduced in v223 by https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/29815b6c608b836cada5e349d06a96b63eaa65f3",
    "tyhicks\u003e Lennart pointed out in the pull request that systemd-resolved is respawned after crashing. Therefore, I've rated this as a low priority.",
    "tyhicks\u003e systemd-resolved became the default DNS resolver in Zesty and it is enabled in Yakkety",
    "tyhicks\u003e systemd-resolved is not used by default in Xenial. It is spawned if a user execs the systemd-resolve utility but that shouldn't impact the system."
