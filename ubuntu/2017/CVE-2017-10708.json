  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Apport through 2.20.x. In apport/report.py, Apport sets the ExecutablePath field and it then uses the path to run package specific hooks without protecting against path traversal. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .crash file.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "tyhicks\u003e Apport registers itself as the default handler for .crash files so an attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious .crash file and execute arbitrary code as the user.",
    "tyhicks\u003e A potential method of hardening apport against these types of attacks is to unregister it as the handler for .crash files."
