  "Description": "unrarlib.c in unrar-free 0.0.1 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash), which could be relevant if unrarlib is used as library code for a long-running application. NOTE: one of the several test cases in the references may be the same as what was separately reported as CVE-2017-14121.",
