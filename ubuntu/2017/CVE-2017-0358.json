  "Description": "Jann Horn of Google Project Zero discovered that NTFS-3G, a read-write NTFS driver for FUSE, does not scrub the environment before executing modprobe with elevated privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw for local root privilege escalation.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "tyhicks\u003e 14.04 and 12.04 are not affected since ntfs-3g is not installed setuid-root. While there is some debconf support for setting ntfs-3g as setuid-root in the packaging, libfuse refuses to cooperate when it detects that it is running in a setuid environment."
