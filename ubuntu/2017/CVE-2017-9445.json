  ],
  "Description": "In systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in systemd-resolved can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A malicious DNS server can exploit this via a response with a specially crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved into allocating a buffer that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end of it.",

    "chrisccoulson\u003e systemd-resolved is not used by default in Xenial. It is spawned if a user execs the systemd-resolve utility, but that shouldn't impact the system."
