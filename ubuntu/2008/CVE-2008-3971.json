  "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the open_man_file function in callbacks.c in gmanedit 0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted man page, which is not properly handled during utf8 conversion. NOTE: another overflow was reported using a configuration file, but that vector does not have a scenario that crosses privilege boundaries.",
