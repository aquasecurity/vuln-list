    "jdstrand\u003e I couldn't reproduce this-- putting a large amount of text doesn't crash gnome-screensaver-- only makes it 'hang' after which it works fine",
    "jdstrand\u003e seems to be OOM local DoS only.  In gs-lock-plug.c submit_note() gnome-screensaver uses gtk_* functions for dealing with the note text, so no overrun potential. Could invoke OOM killer with disabling swap and using large amount of text"
