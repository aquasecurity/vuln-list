  ],
  "Description": "The (1) rand and (2) mt_rand functions in PHP 5.2.6 do not produce cryptographically strong random numbers, which allows attackers to leverage exposures in products that rely on these functions for security-relevant functionality, as demonstrated by the password-reset functionality in Joomla! 1.5.x and WordPress before 2.6.2, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108, and CVE-2008-4102.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e as of 2009-04-10, unfixed in debian with following comment:",
    "mdeslaur\u003e the rand() and mt_rand() functions were never said to be cryptographically strong",
    "mdeslaur\u003e AFAICT, unfixed upstream also",
