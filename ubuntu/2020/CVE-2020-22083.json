  "Description": "jsonpickle through 1.4.1 allows remote code execution during deserialization of a malicious payload through the decode() function. Note: It has been argued that this is expected and clearly documented behaviour. pickle is known to be capable of causing arbitrary code execution, and must not be used with un-trusted data",
