  "Description": "A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in versions before 6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",

  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e Read-only clients can't exploit this flaw.",

    "mdeslaur\u003e access to the read-write socket already grants root-equivalent",
    "mdeslaur\u003e permissions, so this flaw has limited impact. Setting priority",
