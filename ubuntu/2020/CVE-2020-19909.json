  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Integer overflow vulnerability in tool_operate.c in curl 7.65.2 via a large value as the retry delay. NOTE: many parties report that this has no direct security impact on the curl user; however, it may (in theory) cause a denial of service to associated systems or networks if, for example, --retry-delay is misinterpreted as a value much smaller than what was intended. This is not especially plausible because the overflow only happens if the user was trying to specify that curl should wait weeks (or longer) before trying to recover from a transient error.",
