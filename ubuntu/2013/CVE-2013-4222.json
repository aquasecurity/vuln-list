  "Description": "OpenStack Identity (Keystone) Folsom, Grizzly 2013.1.3 and earlier, and Havana before havana-3 does not properly revoke user tokens when a tenant is disabled, which allows remote authenticated users to retain access via the token.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e Debian states that the code is not present in Essex (as included in 12.04 LTS)",
    "jdstrand\u003e Essex does not invalidate user tokens when a tenant is disabled, but the 'keystone tenant-update --enable false ...' doesn't work to a bug in python-keystoneclient. This bug was fixed in the following commit: https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/commit/51f6cc6573319f66b6127d5f2b50e57949b59107 but this is not available in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as of 2013/10/22. Furthermore, on Essex token revocation is not limited to the tenant (this was introduced in https://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/4e1a0867f9e9f42dd7c2abe3a10ca8a8f7dddce3) and this functionality is required for the deficiency described by this CVE to make any sense. Ignoring on 12.04 LTS since disabling a tenant doesn't work, revocation of users via tenants doesn't work as described in this CVE and because upstream considers this CVE a lack of a feature more than a security vulnerability.",
