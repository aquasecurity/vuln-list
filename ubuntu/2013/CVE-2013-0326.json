  "Description": "OpenStack nova base images permissions are world readable",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "seth-arnold\u003e /var/lib/nova/instances/_base/ apparently stores images with DAC permissions set to 0644. Deferred while waiting for upstream to address the issue -- I suspect the fix is simple, but the consequences may not be.",
    "jdstrand\u003e Ignoring. VMs are confined by AppArmor and are not able to read each other's files. Even if this were not the case, the files would be readable by the the libvirt-qemu:kvm user, so changing the permissions to 0640 would not help greatly. Therefore the protection would only be against other users on the system and a typical production Nova installation will not have these types of users or extra services. Furthermore, changing the permissions in a security update could be disruptive to production systems on upgrade.",
    "jdstrand\u003e no upstream fix as of 2014-05-05"
