  "Description": "OpenStack Keystone Grizzly before 2013.1, Folsom, and possibly earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a large HTTP request, as demonstrated by a long tenant_name when requesting a token.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e Keystone on 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other components such as nova and horizon",
    "jdstrand\u003e per upstream (and me), change is to intrusive for stable release update and the upstream patch was rejected for Folsom and earlier. This is more of a feature than a vulnerability."
