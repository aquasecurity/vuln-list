  ],
  "Description": "keystone/middleware/auth_token.py in OpenStack Nova Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana uses an insecure temporary directory for storing signing certificates, which allows local users to spoof servers by pre-creating this directory, which is reused by Nova, as demonstrated using /tmp/keystone-signing-nova on Fedora.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and lower not affected",
    "jdstrand\u003e /tmp/keystone-signing-nova is created but it is owned by the nova user and symlink restrictions are in effect.",
    "jdstrand\u003e upstream fix is to change /etc/nova/api-paste.ini. Since this issue is mitigated by symlink restrictions, ignoring since a config file change is too intrusive"
