  "Description": "The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not initialize the random value for the pointer guard, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by leveraging a buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using the known zero value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e PoC in linux-distros@ (tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 and Debian 7.1)",
    "jdstrand\u003e Only statically compiled executables, dynamic not affected",
    "jdstrand\u003e upstream patch not available as of 2013-07-12",
    "seth-arnold\u003e PTR MANGLE is a security-hardening feature; exploiting this flaw requires a flaw in a statically linked executable that allows write access to one of the types of pointers that is mangled. Fixing the consequences of this flaw requires rebuilding all security-sensitive statically linked executables.",
    "mdeslaur\u003e fix for this was reverted in saucy as it was causing the ARM",
    "mdeslaur\u003e testuite to fail.",
    "sbeattie\u003e fix was re-enabled in trusty with the addition of the patches/any/cvs-CVE-2013-4788-static-ptrguard-arm.diff patch.",
    "mdeslaur\u003e we will not be fixing this issue for earlier releases."
