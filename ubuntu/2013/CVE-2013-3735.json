  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** The Zend Engine in PHP before 5.4.16 RC1, and 5.5.0 before RC2, does not properly determine whether a parser error occurred, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via a crafted function definition, as demonstrated by an attack within a shared web-hosting environment.  NOTE: the vendor's http://php.net/security-note.php page says \"for critical security situations you should be using OS-level security by running multiple web servers each as their own user id.\"",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "seth-arnold\u003e PHP interpreter crashes are outside scope of PHP's security model, OS-provided controls must be used to separate untrusted users' code."
