  "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Java 7 before Update 11 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by (1) using the public getMBeanInstantiator method in the JmxMBeanServer class to obtain a reference to a private MBeanInstantiator object, then retrieving arbitrary Class references using the findClass method, and (2) using the Reflection API with recursion in a way that bypasses a security check by the java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.checkSecurityManager method due to the inability of the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass method to skip frames related to the new reflection API, as exploited in the wild in January 2013, as demonstrated by Blackhole and Nuclear Pack, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4681 and CVE-2012-3174. NOTE: some parties have mapped the recursive Reflection API issue to CVE-2012-3174, but CVE-2012-3174 is for a different vulnerability whose details are not public as of 20130114.  CVE-2013-0422 covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6 is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security checks.  NOTE: as of 20130114, a reliable third party has claimed that the findClass/MBeanInstantiator vector was not fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 11.  If there is still a vulnerable condition, then a separate CVE identifier might be created for the unfixed issue.",

  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e actively being exploited against Oracle Java. As of 2013-01-12 no updates are available from Oracle. Users are advised to disable or uninstall the Oracle java 7 plugin",
    "jdstrand\u003e vulnerability appears to be introduced in Java 7 and Java 6 does not seem affected",
    "jdstrand\u003e IcedTea 7 is affected way but the reproducers currently don't work on Ubuntu. Users are advised to disable and/or uninstall the IcedTea plugin (regardless of version) as a precaution unless its use is strictly required.",
    "jdstrand\u003e per mdeslaur, can't reproduce with icedtea-7-plugin on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 12.10 or with icedtea6-plugin on 12.04 LTS. jdstrand could also not reproduce.",
    "jdstrand\u003e per mdeslaur, reproducer works with Oracle Java 7u10 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 12.10. Confirmed to also work with 7u9.",
