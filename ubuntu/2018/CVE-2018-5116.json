  "Description": "WebExtensions with the \"ActiveTab\" permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 58.",
