  "Description": "It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP server, resulting in the removal of all files in the current working directory of the victim's system.",
