  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e suse does not have plans to fix it and debian marked as negligible.",
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e There is no obvious security impact since there is no scenarios where an untrusted party controls the -TT input value.",
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e Ubuntu is ignoring it as it is being disputed and there is no update as of 2022-02-01."
