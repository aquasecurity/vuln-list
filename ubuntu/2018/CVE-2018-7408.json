  "Description": "An issue was discovered in an npm 5.7.0 2018-02-21 pre-release (marked as \"next: 5.7.0\" and therefore automatically installed by an \"npm upgrade -g npm\" command, and also announced in the vendor's blog without mention of pre-release status). It might allow local users to bypass intended filesystem access restrictions because ownerships of /etc and /usr directories are being changed unexpectedly, related to a \"correctMkdir\" issue.",
