  "Description": "If the \"app.support.baseURL\" preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads \"chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul\" directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 59.",
