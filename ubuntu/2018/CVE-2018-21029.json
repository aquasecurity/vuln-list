  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** systemd 239 through 245 accepts any certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication (SNI) is not sent, and there is no hostname validation with the GnuTLS backend. NOTE: This has been disputed by the developer as not a vulnerability since hostname validation does not have anything to do with this issue (i.e. there is no hostname to be sent).",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e DNS over TLS not enabled by default in Ubuntu.",
    "mdeslaur\u003e this is only an issue in v243 because strict mode got",
    "mdeslaur\u003e introduced (DNSOverTLS=yes). Versions earlier than 243 only",
    "mdeslaur\u003e implemented opportunistic mode which, according to specs,",
    "mdeslaur\u003e might or not validate the resolver and can also be downgraded."
