  ],
  "Description": "OpenSSL before 0.9.8k on WIN64 and certain other platforms does not properly handle a malformed ASN.1 structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash) by placing this structure in the public key of a certificate, as demonstrated by an RSA public key.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e only affects platforms where sizeof(long) \u003c sizeof(void *). These are equal on all releases/architectures, thus Ubuntu is not affected."
