  "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the cli_url_canon function in libclamav/phishcheck.c in ClamAV before 0.95.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted URL.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e only 0.95 is affected (affected code not present-- part of url_hash_match() was moved out to the new cli_url_canon() in 0.95, and cli_url_canon() introduced the bug)"
