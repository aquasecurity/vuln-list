  "Description": "lib/ssluse.c in cURL and libcurl 7.4 through 7.19.5, when OpenSSL is used, does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "sbeattie\u003e hardy's patch for this issue was added to the end of the quilt series; unfortunately, the build system is quirky and pushes up patches by a name, thus the patch for this was not getting applied at build time. Fixed in usn-1158-1.",
