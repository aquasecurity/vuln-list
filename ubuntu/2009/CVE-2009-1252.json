  "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the crypto_recv function in ntp_crypto.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.4p7 and 4.2.5 before 4.2.5p74, when OpenSSL and autokey are enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet containing an extension field.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e from CERT: If autokey is enabled (the ntp.conf file contains the line           \"crypto pw whatever\" a remote attacker can send a carefully crafted             packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow for               malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd              process."
