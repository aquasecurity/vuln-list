  "Description": "MySQL 5.0.88, and possibly other versions and platforms, allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a subdirectory of the MySQL data home directory, related to incorrect calculation of the mysql_unpacked_real_data_home value. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2009-4030 regression, which was not omitted in other packages and versions such as MySQL 5.0.95 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e As of 2012/01/09, Oracle no longer supports MySQL 5.0. Unfortunately, because of upstream update and commit policies it is not possible to backport patches from later releases. Ubuntu is regrettably unable to support MySQL 5.0 and users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or later."
