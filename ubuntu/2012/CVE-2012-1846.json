  "Description": "Google Chrome 17.0.963.66 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass the sandbox protection mechanism by leveraging access to a sandboxed process, as demonstrated by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2012. NOTE: the primary affected product may be clarified later; it was not identified by the researcher, who reportedly stated \"it really doesn't matter if it's third-party code.\"",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e Google claims this is a flash bug, VUPEN claims it isn't and that Google is simply speculating. VUPEN won't release the exploit to Google to fix it, and access to the exploit is behind a paywall, so there is nothing to do. Marking deferred for now. Will re-open if new information is available."
