  ],
  "Description": "PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_main.c.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that PHP allowed the magic_quotes_gpc setting to be disabled remotely. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions that could prevent an SQL injection.",
