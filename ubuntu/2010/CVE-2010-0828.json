  "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in action/Despam.py in the Despam action module in MoinMoin 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by creating a page with a crafted URI.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e XSS in Despam page",
    "jdstrand\u003e The page name is not escaped in the revert_pages() function in Despam.py. It appears only privileged users are allowed to use the Despam action. Since the script must occur in the page name, it is pretty obvious when viewing that the page is suspicious (but this might be why someone was using the Despam action in the first place). There is also a limit on the length of the page name."
