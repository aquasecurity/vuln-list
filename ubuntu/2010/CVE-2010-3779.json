  "Description": "Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.",
