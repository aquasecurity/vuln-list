  "Description": "Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.6.1 through 0.8.2, looks up disk backing stores without referring to the user-defined main disk format, which might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS, and possibly have unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e AppArmor 10.04 should mostly protect the host OS, but an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another machine.",
    "jdstrand\u003e upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected releases, requires a conffile change and a migration helper.",
    "jdstrand\u003e Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is the first release to probe the backing stores"
