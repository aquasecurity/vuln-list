  "Description": "OpenOffice.org 2.x and 3.0 before 3.2.1 allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass Python macro security restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code via a crafted OpenDocument Text (ODT) file that triggers code execution when the macro directory structure is previewed.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Marc Schoenefeld discovered that OpenOffice.org would run document macros from the macro browser, even when macros were disabled.  If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted document and examining a macro, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
