  ],
  "Description": "mountall.c in mountall before 2.15.2 uses 0666 permissions for the root.rules file, which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying this file.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Alasdair MacGregor discovered that mountall created a udev rule file with world-writable permissions. A local attacker could exploit this under certain conditions to cause udev to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.",
  "Notes": [
    "kees\u003e luckily, udev doesn't use inotify on this directory at boot time, so",
    "kees\u003e udev needs to be reloaded before this is really ugly."
