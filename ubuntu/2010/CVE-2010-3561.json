  "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the CORBA component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21 and 5.0 Update 25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that this involves the use of the privileged accept method in the ServerSocket class, which does not limit which hosts can connect and allows remote attackers to bypass intended network access restrictions.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection.  An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by network permissions.",
  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e red hat description: The privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to receive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by network permissions."
