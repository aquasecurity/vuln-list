  "Description": "Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.7.2 through 0.8.2, recurses into disk-image backing stores without extracting the defined disk backing-store format, which might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS, and possibly have unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e AppArmor in Ubuntu 10.04 should mostly protect the host OS, but an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another machine.",
    "jdstrand\u003e upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected releases, requires a conffile change and a migration helper.",
    "jdstrand\u003e Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is the first release to probe the backing stores",
    "jdstrand\u003e the changes for CVE-2010-2238 introduced LP: #665531. Upstream has stated that \"\u003cdriver name='qemu' type='host_device'/\u003e\" was only accidentally supported and that they do not intend to fix it. Since this used to work on 10.04 LTS and a number of people were affected, a fix will be issued for 10.04 LTS only. Libvirt 0.8.3 (in Ubuntu 10.10) will not support specifying type='host_device'. The discussion can be seen on the libvirt mailing."
