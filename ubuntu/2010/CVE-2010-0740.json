  "Description": "The ssl3_get_record function in ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8m allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed record in a TLS connection that triggers a NULL pointer dereference, related to the minor version number. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e according to upstream, if 'short' is a 16-bit integer, this issue applies only to OpenSSL 0.9.8m, otherwise it affects 0.9.8f through 0.9.8m. Confirmed that on all releases of Ubuntu on all architectures that 'short' is 2 bytes. (8.10/sparc and 10.04/armel could not be checked)"
