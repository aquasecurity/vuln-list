  "Description": "TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attackers to guess sequence numbers and cause a denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet, especially in protocols that use long-lived connections, such as BGP.",

  "Notes": [
    "kees\u003e this does not really affect the Linux TCP stack in any meaningful way.",
