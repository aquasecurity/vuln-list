  "Description": "The ConvolveHorizontally function in Skia, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 31.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7, and Thunderbird before 24.7, does not properly handle the discarding of image data during function execution, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by triggering prolonged image scaling, as demonstrated by scaling of a high-quality image.",
