  "Description": "The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by putting the VM into the rescue state, suspending it, which puts into an ERROR state, and then deleting the image. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2573.",

  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e requires use with unsupported VMware ESX driver. This is not compiled in to libvirt in the Ubuntu archive, which makes this code path unavailable in Ubuntu"
