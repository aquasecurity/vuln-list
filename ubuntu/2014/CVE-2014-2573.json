  "Description": "The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.2 through 2013.2.2 does not properly put VMs into RESCUE status, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by requesting the VM be put into rescue and then deleting the image.",

  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e requires use with unsupported VMware ESX driver. This is not compiled in to libvirt in the Ubuntu archive, which makes this code path unavailable in Ubuntu"
