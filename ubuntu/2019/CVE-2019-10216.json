  ],
  "Description": "In ghostscript before version 9.50, the .buildfont1 procedure did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by creating a specially crafted PostScript file that could escalate privileges and access files outside of restricted areas.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Netanel Fisher discovered that the font handler in Ghostscript did not properly restrict privileged calls when '-dSAFER' restrictions were in effect. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access arbitrary files.",
