  "Description": "An integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially crafted arguments from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In installations where /bin/ntfs-3g is a setuid-root binary, this could lead to a local escalation of privileges.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "chrisccoulson\u003e This bug only has security implications when ntfs-3g is installed as setuid-root. It's ignored in Ubuntu releases prior to xenial, as it isn't installed as setuid-root in these releases."
